{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-78}} Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One, the Buddha, was residing in the Deer Park at Ṛṣivadana by Vārāṇasī. At {{note:{index:11,id:UT22084-072-037-94}}} that time the Blessed One spoke to the group of five monks: {{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-072-037-95}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-10}} “Monks, as I {{note:{index:13,id:UT22084-072-037-96}}} focused my mind correctly on the things {{note:{index:14,id:UT22084-072-037-97}}} that I had not hitherto heard, {{page:{number:2,folio:F.275.b}}} thinking, ‘This is suffering, a truth of noble beings,’ vision arose; knowledge, apprehension, understanding, and realization {{note:{index:15,id:UT22084-072-037-98}}} arose.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-79}} “Monks, as I focused my mind correctly on the things that I had not hitherto heard, thinking, ‘This is the origin of suffering, {{note:{index:16,id:UT22084-072-037-99}}} this is the cessation of suffering, and this is the path leading to the cessation of suffering,’ vision arose; knowledge, apprehension, understanding, and realization arose.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-11}} “Monks, as I focused my mind correctly on the things that I had not hitherto heard, thinking, ‘With higher knowledge I should comprehend suffering, that truth of noble beings,’ vision arose; knowledge, apprehension, understanding, and realization arose.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-80}} “Monks, as I focused my mind correctly on the things that I had not hitherto heard, thinking, ‘With higher knowledge I should relinquish the origin of suffering, that truth of noble beings,’ vision arose; knowledge, apprehension, understanding, and realization arose.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-12}} “Monks, as I focused my mind correctly on the things that I had not hitherto heard, thinking, ‘With higher knowledge I should actualize {{note:{index:17,id:UT22084-072-037-100}}} the cessation of suffering, that truth of noble beings,’ vision arose; knowledge, apprehension, understanding, and realization arose.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-81}} “Monks, as I focused my mind correctly on the things that I had not hitherto heard, thinking, ‘With higher knowledge I should cultivate the path leading to the cessation of suffering, that truth of noble beings,’ vision arose; knowledge, apprehension, understanding, and realization arose.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-13}} “Monks, as I focused my mind correctly on the things that I had not hitherto heard, thinking, ‘With higher knowledge I have comprehended suffering, that truth of noble beings,’ vision arose; knowledge, apprehension, understanding, and realization arose.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-82}} “Monks, as I focused my mind correctly on the things that I had not hitherto heard, thinking, ‘With higher knowledge I have relinquished the origin of suffering, that truth of noble beings,’ {{page:{number:3,folio:F.276.a}}} vision arose; knowledge, apprehension, understanding, and realization arose.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-14}} “Monks, as I focused my mind correctly on the things that I had not hitherto heard, thinking, ‘With higher knowledge I have actualized {{note:{index:18,id:UT22084-072-037-101}}} the cessation of suffering, that truth of noble beings,’ vision arose; knowledge, apprehension, understanding, and realization arose.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-83}} “Monks, as I focused my mind correctly on the things that I had not hitherto heard, thinking, ‘With higher knowledge I have cultivated the path leading to the cessation of suffering, that truth of noble beings,’ vision arose; knowledge, apprehension, understanding, and realization arose.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-15}} “Monks, until I had achieved the vision, knowledge, apprehension, understanding, and realization of these four truths of noble beings that are turned in three phases and comprise twelve aspects, {{note:{index:19,id:UT22084-072-037-102}}} I had not been freed from the world replete with gods, māras, Brahmā, mendicants, brahmins, humans, and gods. I had not escaped from it, severed ties with it, or been delivered from it. Nor did I dwell extensively with a mind free from error. Monks, I did not have the knowledge that I had fully awakened to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-16}} “Monks, once I had achieved the vision, knowledge, apprehension, understanding, and realization of turning these four truths of noble beings in three phases with twelve aspects, I was freed from the world replete with gods, māras, Brahmā, mendicants, brahmins, humans, and gods. I had escaped from it, severed ties with it, and been delivered from it. I dwelled extensively with a mind free from error. {{page:{number:4,folio:F.276.b}}} Monks, I then had the knowledge that I had fully awakened to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood.” {{note:{index:20,id:UT22084-072-037-103}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-17}} When the Blessed One had given this Dharma discourse, venerable Kauṇḍinya, along with eighty thousand gods, achieved the Dharma vision that is free from dust and stainless with regard to phenomena.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-18}} The Blessed One now asked venerable Kauṇḍinya, “Kauṇḍinya, did you understand the Dharma?”
“Blessed One,” he replied, “I understood.”
“Kauṇḍinya, did you understand? Did you understand?”
“Blissful One,” he replied, “I understood. I understood.”
“Because venerable Kauṇḍinya has understood the Dharma, venerable Kauṇḍinya shall now be known as Ājñātakauṇḍinya.” {{note:{index:21,id:UT22084-072-037-104}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-19}} At that point the terrestrial yakṣas called out, “Venerable Kauṇḍinya has understood the Dharma!” And they continued, “Friends, in the Deer Park at Ṛṣivadana by Vārāṇasī, the Blessed One has turned the wheel of Dharma in three phases with twelve aspects. He has turned the wheel of Dharma in a way that no mendicant or brahmin, and no god, māra, or Brahmā in the world could ever do in accord with the Dharma. He has done so for the benefit of many beings, for the happiness of many beings, out of love for the world, and for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of gods and humans. Hence, the gods will flourish and the demigods will be on the wane.”
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-20}} As the voices of the terrestrial yakṣas rang out—at that very moment, in that very instant, and at that very time—the news passed to the celestial yakṣas, as well as to the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, the Heaven Free from Strife, the Heaven of Joy, the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations, and all the way to the Brahmā realm. Thus, also the gods in the Brahmā realm announced, “Friends, in the Deer Park at Ṛṣivadana by Vārāṇasī, {{page:{number:5,folio:F.277.a}}} the Blessed One has turned the wheel of Dharma in three phases with twelve aspects. He has turned the wheel of Dharma in a way that no mendicant or brahmin, and no god, māra, or Brahmā in the world could ever do in accord with the Dharma. He has done so for the benefit of many beings, for the happiness of many beings, out of love for the world, and for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of gods and humans. Hence, the gods will flourish and the demigods will be on the wane.”
{{milestone:UT22084-072-037-21}} In the Deer Park at Ṛṣivadana by Vārāṇasī, the Blessed One turned the wheel of Dharma in three phases with twelve aspects. Therefore, this Dharma teaching was named Turning the Wheel of Dharma. {{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-072-037-105}}}
