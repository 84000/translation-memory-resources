{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-043-006-28}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing at Vārāṇasī, in the Deer Park by the Hill of Fallen Sages, accompanied by a great congregation of one thousand monks and five hundred bodhisattvas, most of whom had ripened their roots of virtue and cleared away their obscurations of karma.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-043-006-29}}}At that time, some of the bodhisattvas there continued to enjoy social diversions, liked to sleep, liked to work, liked to talk, and liked deceit; they were soiled with stains, improper, indolent, and lazy. They had poor diligence and had stopped applying themselves. The bodhisattva great being Maitreya noticed those bodhisattvas conducting themselves in these unvirtuous ways. 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-043-006-31}}}The bodhisattva great being Maitreya then thought to himself, “Alas, these bodhisattvas have slackened in their efforts to perfect the branches of awakening. Therefore, I must rouse these bodhisattvas; I must remind them—that is for certain!”
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-043-006-32}}}Accordingly, in the afternoon, the bodhisattva great being Maitreya arose from his inner absorption and proceeded to where those bodhisattvas were staying. When he arrived, the bodhisattva great being {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-043-006-412,folio:F.132.a}}} exchanged greetings with them with sincere joy and delight, and then asked those bodhisattvas, “Tell me, children of noble lineage, are you improving yourselves through the practice of virtue, or have you perhaps been negligent?”
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-043-006-34}}}They answered, “Venerable Maitreya, we have neglected and not increased our practice of virtue. Our minds are ensnared by doubt, as we wonder whether we can become thus-gone ones. Our minds are further ensnared by regret, as we worry that we might fall into lower realms; and so, we have no enthusiasm left for virtuous practice.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-043-006-35}}}The bodhisattva great being Maitreya then said to those bodhisattvas, “Children of noble lineage, come this way.{{note:{index:11,id:UT22084-043-006-36}}} Let us proceed to where the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, and perfect Buddha Śākyamuni is residing. Why? Because the Blessed One is omniscient and all-seeing, possesses unobscured wisdom, and is wise in the ways of all beings; and so, he will teach you the Dharma in a way that is well suited to your level of experience.”
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-043-006-37}}}Then those sixty bodhisattvas, together with the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, went to where the Blessed One was residing. They assembled before him and offered homage with their heads at his feet. They cried and offered homage to the Blessed One with their four limbs and heads, over and over again, with tears streaming down their faces, and without raising their heads. The bodhisattva great being Maitreya, too, prostrated with his head at the feet of the Blessed One, {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-043-006-413,folio:F.132.b}}} circumambulated him three times, and then sat off to one side. 
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-043-006-38}}}The Blessed One then told the bodhisattvas, “Children of noble lineage, stop crying and moaning, and stand up! Without regard for the ripening of karma, you joyfully harmed and abused others, taking delight and pleasure in doing so. Through creating obscurations of karma in that way, you are now obscured and hampered. Being overcome and ensnared, you are unable to exert yourselves.”
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-043-006-39}}}Then those sixty bodhisattvas, hanging their shawls over one shoulder, knelt with their right knees on the ground, joined their palms together respectfully toward the Blessed One, and petitioned him with these words: “Learning this, our minds reverse course; and so, we beg of the Blessed One to explain well to us our obscurations of karma, so that we can refrain from further compounding them hereafter.”
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-043-006-40}}}In response to this request, the Blessed One said the following to those sixty individuals of the Bodhisattva Vehicle: “Children of noble lineage, long ago, in the distant past, during the doctrinal period of the Thus-Gone One Krakucchanda, you took ordination. Thus established, you became intoxicated with conceit about your discipline, drunk with vanity about your learning, and strongly attached to your ascetic practices and your lack of possessions. Consequently, you became jealous and resentful of two monks who were preaching the Dharma, due to the offerings and respect they received, the households{{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-043-006-41}}} of their friends and relatives, and the households of their patrons, and so you directed accusations of lewd conduct at them. This created a schism dividing those two Dharma-teaching monks from the households of their friends and relatives and the households of their patrons, who became skeptical and lost their faith {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-043-006-414,folio:F.133.a}}} in the two monks. By leveling these and many further insults at those two Dharma-teaching monks, you obscured and cut off at the root the virtues of those other beings. 
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-043-006-42}}}“Due to that nonvirtuous obscuration of karma, you were reborn in the major hell Incessant Torment for sixty thousand years. For forty thousand years, you were reborn in the major hell Reviving. For twenty thousand years, you were reborn in the major hell Black Lines. For eight thousand years, you were reborn in the major hell of Heat. Afterward, once you died and passed from that realm, you managed to obtain human rebirths, but for five hundred consecutive lifetimes you had no eyes, and so were blind. Through the shrouding effect of your obscurations of karma, no matter where you were reborn, in all those lifetimes you were dimwitted and absent-minded. You were shrouded by your obscurations rooted in unvirtuous acts and were entirely hapless. You were oppressed by ugly flaws and frequently reviled, cursed, and ridiculed. You were reborn in bad lands, bad regions, and bad countries, into bad and impoverished families; you had meager means and little respect, and you were ostracized and unsupported. 
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-043-006-43}}}“When you have died and passed from this life, during the final half-millennium, at the time when the sacred Dharma is fading, you will be reborn solely in bad lands, into low-caste families and poverty. You will be reviled and feeble-minded, and you will abandon the roots of virtue. Even when you apply yourselves, obstacles will arise; and although moments of clarity will dawn, they will subsequently fade away.
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-043-006-44}}}“During the final half-millennium, all your obscurations of karma will finally be exhausted. With their exhaustion, next you will be reborn in Sukhāvatī, the buddha realm of the Thus-Gone One Amitābha. The Thus-Gone One Amitābha also will prophesy your unsurpassed and perfect awakening.”
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-043-006-45}}}The sad and distraught minds of those sixty children of noble lineage who belonged to the Bodhisattva Vehicle {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-043-006-415,folio:F.133.b}}} then turned perfectly joyous. Wiping the tears from their faces, and with their bodily hairs standing on end, they petitioned the Blessed One as follows: 
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-043-006-46}}}“Blessed One, we confess the fault of generating a hostile attitude toward individuals who belong to the Bodhisattva Vehicle, and we also confess any other obscurations of karma we have amassed. 
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-043-006-47}}}“Blessed One, from today onward, we make the following promises in the presence of the Thus-Gone One:
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-043-006-48}}}“Blessed One, from today onward, if we should speak of the failings, no matter whether they are many or few,{{note:{index:13,id:UT22084-043-006-49}}} of individuals belonging to the Bodhisattva Vehicle, then we will have betrayed the thus-gone, worthy, and perfect Buddha. 
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-043-006-50}}}“Blessed One, from today onward, if we should insult{{note:{index:14,id:UT22084-043-006-51}}} individuals who belong to the Bodhisattva Vehicle or speak rudely to them, then we will have betrayed the thus-gone, worthy, and perfect Buddha.
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-043-006-52}}}“Blessed One, from today onward, if we see individuals who belong to the Bodhisattva Vehicle, whether they are lay or ordained, amusing themselves with and enjoying the five sense pleasures, and this makes us lose faith, such that we become disrespectful or unable to perceive them as teachers, then we will have betrayed the Thus-Gone One.
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-043-006-53}}}“Blessed One, from today onward, if we physically or mentally harm individuals belonging to the Bodhisattva Vehicle on account of the households of their friends and relatives or the households of their patrons, {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-043-006-416,folio:F.134.a}}} then we will have betrayed the Thus-Gone One.
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-043-006-54}}}“Blessed One, from today onward, if even a single unpleasant word slips from our mouths upon seeing an individual belonging to the Bodhisattva Vehicle, then we will have betrayed the Thus-Gone One.
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-043-006-55}}}“Blessed One, from today onward, if we fail to pay homage to individuals belonging to the Bodhisattva Vehicle three times during the day and three times at night, then we will have betrayed the Thus-Gone One.
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-043-006-56}}}“Blessed One, from today onward, if we are unwilling to sacrifice a kingdom or a fortune, or to risk life and limb, for the sake of this disciplined conduct to which we have committed, then we will have betrayed the Thus-Gone One.
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-043-006-57}}}“Blessed One, from today onward, if we demean individuals belonging to the Hearer or Solitary Buddha Vehicles, thinking, ‘We most assuredly are not like them!’ then we will have betrayed the Thus-Gone One.
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-043-006-58}}}“Blessed One, from today onward, if we do not maintain an attitude of humility, as if we were outcasts or dogs, then we will have betrayed the Thus-Gone One.
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-043-006-59}}}“Blessed One, from today onward, if we praise ourselves or criticize others, then we will have betrayed the Thus-Gone One.
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-043-006-60}}}“Blessed One, from today onward, if we are at risk of becoming involved in conflict and dispute and we do not immediately distance ourselves from it{{note:{index:15,id:UT22084-043-006-61}}} by a mile or a hundred miles, then we will have betrayed the Thus-Gone One.
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-043-006-62}}}“Blessed One, from today onward, if we claim to have good discipline, or refer to ourselves as well educated or well trained, or as having any good qualities at all, then we will have betrayed the Thus-Gone One. {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-043-006-417,folio:F.134.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-043-006-63}}}“Blessed One, from today onward, if we do not refrain from boasting of our virtues and concealing our faults, then we will have betrayed the thus-gone, worthy, and perfect Buddha.”
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-043-006-64}}}Then the Blessed One congratulated those individuals belonging to the Bodhisattva Vehicle, saying, “Well said! Well said, children of noble lineage! Well said! You have spoken well! This commitment is well made. If you abide by this commitment, your obscurations of karma will be purified, and you likewise will acquire pure roots of virtue.”
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-043-006-65}}}At that point the Blessed One addressed the bodhisattva great being Maitreya: “Maitreya, sons or daughters of noble lineage who wish to purify their obscurations of karma should make just the type of commitment these children of noble lineage have made.”
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-043-006-66}}}Then the bodhisattva great being Maitreya asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, will these children of noble lineage fulfill this commitment, or will they abandon it? Please tell me.”
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-043-006-67}}}“Maitreya, these children of noble lineage will never abandon their commitment, even at the cost of life and limb.”
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-043-006-68}}}Then the bodhisattva great being Maitreya asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, during the final half-millennium, when the sacred Dharma is perishing, if an individual who belongs to the Bodhisattva Vehicle possesses certain qualities, will that person then be spared harm and injury,{{note:{index:16,id:UT22084-043-006-69}}} and readily attain liberation?”
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-043-006-70}}}The Blessed One responded to the question posed by the bodhisattva great being Maitreya in this way: “Maitreya, if an individual who belongs to the Bodhisattva {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-043-006-418,folio:F.135.a}}} Vehicle possesses four qualities, then during the final half-millennium, when the sacred Dharma is perishing, that person will be spared harm and injury, and will be liberated without difficulty. What are the four? (1) Recognizing one’s own mistakes, (2) not discussing the faults of others who belong to the Bodhisattva Vehicle, (3) paying no attention to the households of friends and relatives and the households of patrons, and (4) abandoning unpleasant speech. Maitreya,{{note:{index:17,id:UT22084-043-006-71}}} if an individual who belongs to the Bodhisattva Vehicle possesses those four qualities, then during the final half-millennium, when the sacred Dharma is perishing, that person will be spared harm and injury, and will be liberated without difficulty.
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-043-006-72}}}“Moreover, Maitreya, if someone who belongs to the Bodhisattva Vehicle possesses another four qualities, then during the final half-millennium, when the sacred Dharma is perishing, that person will be spared harm and injury, and will be liberated without difficulty. What are these other four? (1) Avoiding beings who are of little learning, (2) not collecting followers, (3) taking shelter in sparsely inhabited places, and (4) diligently training oneself to be disciplined and peaceful and to remain tranquil. 
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-043-006-73}}}“Maitreya, if someone who belongs to the Bodhisattva Vehicle possesses these other four qualities, then during the final half-millennium, when the sacred Dharma is perishing, that person will be spared harm and injury, and will be liberated without difficulty.
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-043-006-74}}}“Maitreya, because sons or daughters of noble lineage who belong to the Bodhisattva Vehicle will want to be spared harm and injury, be liberated without difficulty, and exhaust entirely their obscurations of karma during the final half-millennium when the sacred Dharma is perishing, they should (1) dislike social diversions, (2) stay in the wilderness, in forests, and in sparsely inhabited places, (3) avoid beings who lack noble lineage or diligence, (4) reflect on their own mistakes and not look for mistakes in others, (5) enjoy silence, and, (6) through the perfection of insight, enjoy being at rest. {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-043-006-419,folio:F.135.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-043-006-75}}}“If the wish to converse with others ever arises within them, then they should offer them the gift of Dharma while remaining free of materialistic interest. 
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-043-006-76}}}“Maitreya, giving the gift of Dharma without materialistic interest, without the desire for offerings or respect, confers twenty benefits. These twenty are as follows:
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-043-006-77}}}“One will (1) have mindfulness, (2) have intelligence, (3) be judicious, (4) gain stability, (5) possess insight, (6) realize supermundane insight, (7) have less desire, (8) have less anger, (9) have less delusion, (10) become invulnerable to māras, (11) come to the attention of the blessed buddhas, (12) be guarded by nonhuman spirits, (13) be favored with splendor by the gods, (14) become invincible to enemies, and (15) not be separated from friends and relatives; (16) one’s word will be sacrosanct; (17) one will become fearless; (18) one’s mind will grow happier; (19) one will be honored by the wise; and (20) one’s offerings of the Dharma will become worthy of commemoration as well.
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-043-006-78}}}“And so, Maitreya, these twenty are the benefits that accrue when one offers the Dharma free of materialistic interest, having rejected all interest in gain or respect, and without hoping to get food or clothing, simply motivated by an altruistic intent to offer the gift of Dharma continually and repeatedly.
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-043-006-79}}}“Maitreya, offering the Dharma with an attitude that is free of materialistic interest has another twenty benefits. What are these twenty?

Those with faulty discernment will rely on such teachers!

Dispensing with offering the Dharma while free of materialistic interest, they will teach the Dharma to others for the sake of clothing, food, bedding, cushions, curative medicines, {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-043-006-421,folio:F.136.b}}} and other useful items. 
{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-043-006-84}}}“Maitreya, it is like this. If, for instance, some person had hunks of putrid, rotting flesh hung around his neck, whether from the corpse of a dog, a human, or a monkey, he would wish to clean himself. And so, with embarrassment and revulsion, he would seek to rid himself of them. In the same way, those future teachers will be embarrassed and appalled by the prospect of offering the Dharma without obtaining material benefit. Once they realize there is nothing to be gained,{{note:{index:18,id:UT22084-043-006-85}}} they will be disappointed, refuse to teach, and leave.

They will claim, ‘We gather followers only out of love, and so we have no need at all for them to serve and respect us. Because of our altruistic principles, in order to bring beings to maturity, we spend all our time visiting villages, towns, cities, states, and royal palaces’; and so they will promote themselves to many people. What they have in mind, however, is to go searching for food and clothing.
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-043-006-87}}}“Maitreya, now, I would not speak of a desirous mind bringing beings to maturity. Why not? Because, if one has not even matured oneself—a state that is not so easy to attain—then bringing other beings to maturity is out of the question.

{{milestone:{label:1.65,id:UT22084-043-006-103}}}Then the bodhisattva great being Maitreya asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One,{{note:{index:20,id:UT22084-043-006-104}}} will these sixty bodhisattvas be obscured by short-lived obscurations of karma, or will they be obscured in some other fashion?”
{{milestone:{label:1.66,id:UT22084-043-006-105}}}The Blessed One responded to the bodhisattva Maitreya, “Maitreya, in the final half-millennium, most bodhisattvas will be obscured by obscurations of karma. Some of those bodhisattvas will exhaust their obscurations of karma. Some will increase them.
{{milestone:{label:1.67,id:UT22084-043-006-106}}}“Maitreya, furthermore, among these particular sixty bodhisattvas, there are twenty bodhisattvas who have only minor obscurations of karma, or slight obscurations of karma, and these will take rebirth during the final half-millennium in different villages and towns and in a variety of castes, where they will be learned, circumspect, upright, wise, and skillful. They will be broad-minded, richly beneficial to others, {{page:{number:14,id:UT22084-043-006-424,folio:F.138.a}}} very compassionate, and handsome and lovely to behold. They will not put their virtues on display, will hide their qualities, and will be stable in their conduct. Taking ordination out of these various castes, they will train toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening over uncountable eons, and they will preserve and uphold this ordination, even risking life and limb, as they dwell in wildernesses, jungles, and sparsely populated places, without interest in gain or respect. They will always be diligent, superbly diligent, skillful in relating to the ways of beings, expert in secret mantra and scholarly treatises, very quick learners, expert in special insight, and of flawless acumen.

Blessed One, those bodhisattvas who will come to the fore in the final half-millennium are just like people of childish nature who defecate into the springs, wells, or lakes, and then when they seek to draw water out, find fault with that water; similarly, having faulty discernment, they will discredit those who teach the Dharma and discredit even the Dharma itself. And although they are the ones who have discredited it, they will still believe that they are seeking the taste of the Dharma.

Maitreya, they are (1) when the discourse is meaningful instead of meaningless, (2) when it contains the Dharma as opposed to not containing the Dharma, (3) when it makes defilements decrease and does not make defilements increase, and (4) when it teaches the qualities and benefits of nirvāṇa and does not increase the defects of saṃsāra. Maitreya, one should know that any discourse is what the Buddha spoke when it possesses these four factors.

If you wonder why that is so, Maitreya, it is because everything that is well spoken—no matter what it is—is what the Buddha taught. 
{{milestone:{label:1.82,id:UT22084-043-006-124}}}“Maitreya, when someone says, ‘This is not what the Buddha taught,’ because they feel hostility toward the speaker, then that person has rejected those four conditions and caused them to be disrespected. That person has thereby rejected all discourses that are the teaching of the Buddha. Having rejected the Dharma, that person accumulates the karma of abandoning the Dharma, and so is destined for the lower realms. Maitreya, since this is the case, faithful sons or daughters of noble family who want to avoid the karma of rejecting the Dharma should never feel hostility toward the Dharma out of hostility for an individual.

Maitreya, these four types of discourse have been rejected and are not sanctioned by the buddhas.”
{{milestone:{label:1.84,id:UT22084-043-006-126}}}Then the bodhisattva great being Maitreya asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, if it is the case that the buddhas have not approved of discourse that causes saṃsāra to increase, how is it that the Blessed One taught that defilements are good for bodhisattvas, in order for them to perfect the branches of awakening? And how is it that he recommended that they embrace saṃsāra as well? Or else, Blessed One, are such teachings not those of the Buddha after all?”
{{milestone:{label:1.85,id:UT22084-043-006-127}}}In response, the Blessed One asked, “Maitreya, what do you think about this? Is there meaning, or is there no meaning, in my teaching that defilements are helpful for bodhisattvas, to aid them in perfecting the branches of awakening, and in my teaching recommending that they embrace saṃsāra?”
{{milestone:{label:1.86,id:UT22084-043-006-128}}}He answered, “Since the Blessed One speaks perfectly, if he says that bodhisattvas should appreciate defilements, so that they might perfect the branches of awakening, then it certainly is meaningful, and it certainly contains the Dharma. Consequently, it is undoubtedly the speech of he who speaks perfectly.”
{{milestone:{label:1.87,id:UT22084-043-006-129}}}The Blessed One replied, “Maitreya, since that is so, as is the case with the teaching that defilements support bodhisattvas in perfecting the branches of awakening, and the express injunction to embrace saṃsāra, {{page:{number:19,id:UT22084-043-006-430,folio:F.140.b}}} one must recognize that whatever is well spoken is what the Buddha spoke. Why is that? Maitreya, those matters that are the exclusive province of bodhisattvas with masterful command over the Dharma do not apply to hearers and solitary buddhas. As bodhisattvas will not experience them as defilements, defilements will not harm them.
{{milestone:{label:1.88,id:UT22084-043-006-130}}}“Maitreya, although that is so, defilements are not beneficial for others. For them they do not serve the purpose of perfecting the factors of awakening, have no value, and produce not even the slightest trace of virtue. Others must not succumb to the power of those very defilements for which bodhisattvas will risk even life and limb. And why is that? Because, Maitreya, teachings on defilements for bodhisattvas who have attained the power of wisdom are one thing, while teachings for those on levels at which the powers of bodhisattvas have not yet developed are a different matter.”
{{milestone:{label:1.89,id:UT22084-043-006-131}}}The bodhisattva great being Maitreya then said to the Blessed One, “As I understand the meaning of what the Blessed One has stated, bodhisattvas who seek not to create further obscurations of karma, who strive to purify their obscurations of karma, and who seek to be liberated easily, without harm or injury, will therefore have to take interest in all bodhisattva conduct in the final half-millennium, and practice it more and more, without reservation. They must not look for faults in others, must embrace all that is beneficial, and must focus on what is most essential.”
{{milestone:{label:1.90,id:UT22084-043-006-132}}}The Blessed One replied, “Maitreya, it is just so. Bodhisattvas will have to increase the scope of their bodhisattva conduct, without any reservations. {{page:{number:20,id:UT22084-043-006-431,folio:F.141.a}}} Why is that? Maitreya, it is because the experience of bodhisattvas who enjoy superior discernment is entirely at odds with the rest of the world.
{{milestone:{label:1.91,id:UT22084-043-006-133}}}“As an analogy, Maitreya, while the conduct of stream enterers{{note:{index:24,id:UT22084-043-006-134}}} may resemble that of ordinary beings, they are not stained by the faults of ordinary, immature beings. You see, whereas desire, anger, and obliviousness cause childish, ordinary beings to fall into the lower realms, desire, anger, and obliviousness do not cause stream enterers to fall into the lower realms, since they have realized the nature of the transitory assemblage.
{{milestone:{label:1.92,id:UT22084-043-006-135}}}“Similarly, Maitreya, since they have not yet eliminated habitual tendencies, bodhisattvas who enjoy superior discernment may yet be caught unaware by desire and aversion, but their situation is quite different from that of childish, ordinary beings. Why is that? Latent tendencies do not thoroughly ensnare or occupy their minds; and so, their situation is not at all comparable to that of ordinary, immature beings, or bodhisattvas who have dim faculties and are not sharp in their renunciation.

{{milestone:{label:1.97,id:UT22084-043-006-140}}}The Blessed One replied to this question posed by the bodhisattva great being Maitreya as follows: “Maitreya, fledgling bodhisattvas who leave their homes behind and are developing their powers of insight should reject gain and honor and see the fault in gain and honor.

{{milestone:{label:1.213,id:UT22084-043-006-270}}}The bodhisattva great being Maitreya then said to the Blessed One, “Now that the Blessed One has explained the drawbacks of bodhisattvas enjoying social diversions and liking to work, would the Blessed One next explain how to examine the shortcomings of bodhisattvas liking to deceive? {{page:{number:40,id:UT22084-043-006-451,folio:F.151.a}}} What are the things bodhisattvas should examine, if they are to remain peaceful and not engage in disputes?”
{{milestone:{label:1.214,id:UT22084-043-006-271}}}The Blessed One said, “Maitreya, to summarize, there are twenty shortcomings of bodhisattvas liking to deceive that must be examined. More broadly, the thus-gone ones have taught that these faults are limitless; there is no end to them. What are these twenty faults, Maitreya, of bodhisattvas who like to be deceitful? (1) They experience a great deal of suffering and unhappiness in their lives; (2) they lose their sense of patience; (3) their opponents rejoice in that loss; (4) Māra, too, takes great satisfaction in that loss; (5) Māra’s cohorts delight in it as well; (6) virtuous qualities that have not yet arisen in them do not arise; (7) those that have arisen disappear; (8) their disputes, grudges, arguments, and conflicts increase; (9) those disputes, arguments, and conflicts actively create karma that leads to rebirth in the lower realms; (10) they are bound to a course of sheer recklessness; (11) their speech becomes crude; (12) they do not properly retain Dharma transmissions they previously have received; (13) sūtra transmissions they have not previously received never reach their ears; (14) they entirely abandon all their spiritual mentors; (15) they quickly associate with evil friends; (16) they take ordination on the path of austerity; (17) they hear an uninterrupted flow of unpleasant words; (18) no matter where they are reborn they are born skeptics; (19) in their future lives, the eight states lacking leisure will always be close by; and (20) whatever good they try to do will always run into obstacles. Maitreya, those twenty summarize the shortcomings of enjoying deceit, {{page:{number:41,id:UT22084-043-006-452,folio:F.151.b}}} and these are what must be avoided.”
{{milestone:{label:1.215,id:UT22084-043-006-272}}}The Blessed One then spoke these verses:

{{milestone:{label:1.236,id:UT22084-043-006-294}}}The Blessed One answered, “Maitreya, few individuals belonging to the Bodhisattva Vehicle in the final half-millennium, upon hearing these types of sublime words, will feel chastened and abandon defiled behavior.
{{milestone:{label:1.237,id:UT22084-043-006-295}}}“Maitreya, those whose temperaments are marked by arrogance, disrespect, stubborn pride, and mistrustfulness will be in the majority.

{{milestone:{label:1.241,id:UT22084-043-006-301}}}The bodhisattva great being Maitreya then asked the Blessed One, {{page:{number:44,id:UT22084-043-006-455,folio:F.153.a}}} “Blessed One, among the many qualities of the Thus-Gone One Amitāyus that the Thus-Gone One has explained, it was mentioned that if one applies one’s mind to the cultivation of certain positive attitudes, and brings to mind the Thus-Gone One Amitāyus himself, one will take rebirth in his buddha realm. Blessed One, since that is so, what are those positive attitudes?”
{{milestone:{label:1.242,id:UT22084-043-006-302}}}The Blessed One answered the bodhisattva great being Maitreya in the following way: “Maitreya, the positive attitudes that result in rebirth in Sukhāvatī, the buddha realm of the Thus-Gone One Amitāyus, are not attitudes generated by childish beings. They are not attitudes generated by anyone other than holy beings. They are not attitudes generated by a defiled mind. 
{{milestone:{label:1.243,id:UT22084-043-006-303}}}“Maitreya, there are ten such positive attitudes to be generated. What are they? Maitreya, I shall put it this way: (1) Harboring resentment toward the conduct of any being will make one incapable of taking rebirth in the buddha realm of the Thus-Gone One Amitāyus; and so, generate the attitude of loving kindness toward all beings. (2) Ridding oneself of all enmity, generate the attitude of compassion for all beings. (3) Generate the determination to preserve the sacred Dharma, without concern for life and limb. (4) Develop strong dedication to the sacred Dharma, through certainty that one can tolerate the profound. (5) Give rise to completely pure intentions by not being stained by gain and honor. (6) Through perfect recall, generate the viewpoint that the state of omniscience is extremely precious. (7) Without getting discouraged, generate an attitude of respect towards all beings, as if they were one’s guru. {{page:{number:45,id:UT22084-043-006-456,folio:F.153.b}}} (8) Develop the attitude of not enjoying mere short-lived meditative experiences, by being certain about the branches of awakening. (9) By seeing them distinctly, cultivate a wide assortment of virtuous roots. (10) Abandoning conceptual constructs, cultivate a state of contemplation that simply recalls the Buddha.
{{milestone:{label:1.244,id:UT22084-043-006-304}}}“Maitreya, these are the ten positive attitudes. If one develops any among these ten attitudes—no matter which ones—then, because one has given rise to and possesses these attitudes, there is no chance that one will not be born in that buddha realm.”
{{milestone:{label:1.245,id:UT22084-043-006-305}}}The venerable Ānanda then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, this account of the Dharma, which inspires determination, is truly incredible—how wonderful it is indeed!”
{{milestone:{label:1.246,id:UT22084-043-006-306}}}The Blessed One voiced his approval to the venerable Ānanda, saying, “Excellent! Ānanda, that is excellent, truly excellent! Ānanda, for that reason, you must retain this account of Dharma, which you have called ‘Inspiring Determination.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:1.247,id:UT22084-043-006-307}}}After the Blessed One made this pronouncement, the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, the other bodhisattvas who were present, the venerable Ānanda along with the world’s gods, humans, asuras and gandharvas, rejoiced in and extolled what the Blessed One had said.
