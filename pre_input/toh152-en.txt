Chapter One: Refining the Precious Mind of Omniscience
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-16}} {{page:{number:1,folio:F.1.b}}} Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-17}} Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was staying at Rājagṛha, domain of the thus-gone ones, in a jeweled pavilion. It is the home of the thus-gone ones, adorned with accumulations of great merit, produced by great deeds, the result of the ripening of all qualities of buddhahood; the home of great bodhisattvas; an infinite display; a place blessed with the thus-gone ones’ magic; an entry point to wisdom’s unobstructed domain; a source of great joy; a gateway to mindfulness, intelligence, and realization; a place without blame; {{page:{number:2,folio:F.2.a}}} a place formed with wisdom; a gateway to unobstructed wisdom; a place that has been praised for limitless eons; and a place that embodies an immeasurable accumulation of positive qualities.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-18}} The Blessed One had perfectly realized the sameness of all phenomena. He had set the wheel of Dharma in motion. He led a limitless assembly of highly disciplined disciples. He had achieved dominion over all phenomena. He knew how to fulfill the intentions of all beings. He had achieved the sublime perfection of faculties. He was skilled in destroying the binding force of habitual patterns. His awakened activities were spontaneous and unceasing.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-19}} With him was a great monastic saṅgha of six million monks. All of them had minds of great refinement. They were diligently destroying the binding force of the habitual patterns of the afflictive emotions. They were the progeny of the thus-gone Dharma kings. They were immersed in the profound Dharma. They had found release through the Dharma of no apprehension. They had perfectly gracious behavior. They were worthy of offerings. They were careful in following the word of the Thus-Gone One.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-20}} There was also a great bodhisattva saṅgha there, which was composed of bodhisattva great beings who had attained the bodhisattva acceptance that nothing is apprehended. They were on the bodhisattva levels where they received empowerment. They played in the unconditioned super-knowledge of bodhisattvas. They had received the casket containing inexhaustible {{page:{number:3,folio:F.2.b}}} bodhisattva dhāraṇīs. They had attained mastery of the bodhisattva absorption of the heroic gait. They had acquired the ability to satisfy all beings with the correct discriminations of the bodhisattva. Because their bodhisattva activity was spontaneous, they were steady in the pure motivation that is beautifully adorned with emancipation.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-21}} There were limitless, countless, inconceivable, unmatchable, immeasurable, and unfathomable bodhisattva great beings present, including the bodhisattva great being Inexhaustible Treasury, the bodhisattva great being Limitless Intelligence, the bodhisattva great being Infinite Eloquence, the bodhisattva great being Non-referential Concentration, the bodhisattva great being Unsurpassed Diligence, the bodhisattva great being Diligent Intelligence, the bodhisattva great being Continuous Intelligence, the bodhisattva great being Pinnacle of Nonattached Fearlessness, the bodhisattva great being Discerning Vision, as well as other limitless, countless, inconceivable, unmatchable, immeasurable, and unfathomable bodhisattva great beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-22}} At that time the Blessed One gave a teaching on how to engage in bodhisattva conduct and thereby focus on liberation, the unobscured gateway, and the bodhisattva path. That teaching is the source of the wisdom that manifests all the strengths , fearlessnesses, and qualities of buddhahood. It is a gateway to the seal of dhāraṇī that masters all phenomena. It is a gateway to gaining certainty through the correct discriminations. {{page:{number:4,folio:F.3.a}}} It leads to the wisdom of great super-knowledge. It teaches the irreversibility of the irreversible wheel. It subsumes all vehicles within sameness. It shows how the realm of phenomena is unadulterated and a single principle. It shows how to know the thoughts and faculties of all beings. It is that which is essential. It leads to no doubt about the Dharma. It defeats all the regions of Māra. It shows how to appropriately enter and penetrate the Dharma way. It tames all afflictive emotions and views. It realizes unobstructed wisdom. It teaches knowledge of the skillful method of dedication. It realizes the wisdom of the sameness of all the buddhas. It shows the gateway of the blessings of nonattachment. It resolves all doubts about phenomena as they are. It realizes sameness without thought or conceptuality. It gives rise to understanding of profound dependent origination. It gathers the accumulations of merit and wisdom. It possesses the ornaments of sameness, which are the body, speech, and mind of the buddhas. It accomplishes inexhaustible mindfulness, intelligence, understanding, aspiration, and insight. To guide through the vehicle of the hearers it shows the truths of the noble ones. To guide through the vehicle of the solitary buddhas it teaches knowledge of physical and mental solitude. To guide through the Great Vehicle it shows how to attain consecration into omniscience. It shows how to gain mastery over all phenomena.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-23}} Such was the Dharma teaching that the Blessed One taught in order to express the qualities of the thus-gone ones. Thus he spoke it, taught it, explained it, encouraged memorization of it, encouraged recitation of it, made it understood, made it well understood, made it very well understood, set it forth, defined it, proclaimed it, clarified it, and revealed it. {{page:{number:5,folio:F.3.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-24}} As the Blessed One extensively and genuinely delivered this Dharma teaching, which is a section of The Great Compilation , and that thoroughly ascertains what is true, {{note:{index:9,id:UT22084-058-001-25}}} the entire trichiliocosm, from the earth below up to the ground of the jeweled pavilion, became filled with water, as if it had become a single ocean. The entire trichiliocosm was flooded with water, just as happens during the eon of formation, which follows the eon of burning, when everything is covered by a mass of water. However, although all the worlds in the trichiliocosm appeared to be filled with water as in a single ocean, still all the villages, cities, towns, lands, regions, and palaces could be seen without obstruction. Additionally, all the Jambudvīpas, four-continent worlds, great oceans, Mount Merus, and gods of the desire realm were clearly visible, just as they normally are.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-26}} Lotuses sprang from this mass of water. Their branches were made of beryl, their stalks of sapphire, their leaves of gold from the Jambu River, their stamens of śrīgarbha gems, and their hearts of emerald. They were draped with nets of pearls. They had many trillions of petals. In terms of their size, they were many trillions of miles wide. They rose from the base of the jeweled pavilion up to the height of a palm tree. The entire assembly then appeared arranged on those lotuses. A light issued forth from the lotuses such that limitless, countless buddha realms throughout the ten directions were pervaded by a tremendous brightness. {{page:{number:6,folio:F.4.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-27}} The entire assembly was amazed at this, and said to themselves about the revelation of these omens, “This means an important teaching is coming!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-28}} Upon seeing this great magical display, the bodhisattva great being Maitreya stood up from his lotus seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. With his palms together he bowed toward the Blessed One and asked, “Blessed One, whose prophecy is represented by the worlds of the trichiliocosm being filled with water like a single ocean, the manifestation of these trillions of lotuses, and this vast magical display like none we have ever heard of or seen before?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-29}} The Blessed One answered the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, saying, “Maitreya, below this buddha realm, beyond as many buddha realms as there are atoms in all the worlds of the trichiliocosm, is the world Adorned with Immaculate and Countless Precious Qualities. There dwells the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Master of the Ocean with Noble and Playful Super-knowledge. He lives there and is teaching the Dharma. In that buddha realm, the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati and countless other bodhisattva great beings are gazing at me, venerating me, and honoring me. They are coming to the Sahā world to ask questions about the present Dharma teaching. {{page:{number:7,folio:F.4.b}}} This is what the omen symbolized.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-30}} Venerable Śāriputra asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, how can this be? If the bodhisattva Sāgaramati is so far away, how is he listening to this teaching?”
“Śāriputra,” answered the Blessed One, “the bodhisattva Sāgaramati is listening to this Dharma teaching from that world in the same way that you are listening to it in my presence. Śāriputra, the bodhisattva Sāgaramati can see me and the entire assembly just like you can.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-32}} “Blessed One, how amazing! The power of the wisdom of bodhisattva great beings’ super-knowledge is unfathomable. It is incredible that even from such a distance his eyes can see such forms and his ears can hear such sounds without obscuration. Blessed One, how could anyone who hears of the unfathomable greatness of the qualities of bodhisattva great beings not develop the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-33}} When the elder Śāriputra made this observation, forty-two thousand gods developed the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-34}} At this point, the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati, accompanied and attended on by countless other bodhisattva great beings, requested permission to take leave from the thus-gone Master of the Ocean with Noble and Playful Super-knowledge, which that blessed one granted him. Then, in the blink of an eye, through the Buddha’s playfully engaging in the bases of miracles, his unconditioned miracles, {{page:{number:8,folio:F.5.a}}} and the mindfulness attained by a one-pointed mind, they disappeared from the world Adorned with Immaculate and Countless Precious Qualities and arrived at the Sahā world.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-35}} He appeared in the heart of a lotus elevated to the height of seven palm trees above the base of the jeweled pavilion. The other bodhisattva great beings also appeared arrayed in the hearts of the lotuses. More and more countless and immeasurable numbers of bodhisattva great beings followed the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati from other countless buddha realms in the lower direction to hear the Dharma. These bodhisattva great beings gathered from worlds throughout the ten directions and arrayed themselves on the lotuses. They beautified the jeweled pavilion to a great degree as they shimmered, glimmered, and glittered. The entire assembly was astonished. They joined their palms together in joy, faith, and happiness and prostrated to these bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-36}} Then, in an act of veneration, the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati caused a great rain of flowers to fall in front of the Blessed One. The flowers, which were from the world Adorned with Immaculate and Countless Precious Qualities, were known as “delightful, pleasing, and lovely to behold.” They were replete with trillions of petals, a full mile across, and worthy of offering to a thus-gone one. The rain was the product of the bodhisattva’s pure intentions and purified by previous roots of virtue. The flowers were brilliant, beautiful, luminous, and had the most incredibly pleasing aroma, satisfying the entire assembly. {{page:{number:9,folio:F.5.b}}} The rain of flowers filled the jeweled pavilion to the depth of seven body lengths. The cymbals called “sustenance of isolated concentration” also resounded, causing the entire assembly to experience a satisfying bliss while resting in concentration.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-37}} Once the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati had venerated the Blessed One in this way, he bowed his head to the feet of the Blessed One and circumambulated him seven times. Joining his palms before the Blessed One, he expressed well-wishes to the Blessed One, saying, “Blessed One, the Thus-Gone Master of the Ocean with Noble and Playful Super-knowledge hopes that you are healthy, and that you are experiencing no adversity, intimidation, or agitation, and that you are strong and happy.” Then, the other bodhisattva great beings as well bowed their heads to the feet of the Blessed One. After circumambulating him seven times they returned to their seats.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-38}} At that point, the Brahmā of the trichiliocosm, known as Great Compassionate One, was residing in the Brahmā world, a peaceful place free from any trouble. From there he saw the worlds of the trichiliocosm being filled with water like a single ocean, the manifestation of the trillions of brilliant and pleasing lotuses, and the jeweled pavilion filled with bodhisattvas. Seeing this, he pondered, “The eon of burning has not yet occurred, yet this flood has manifested. What could have caused the appearance of this magical display? {{page:{number:10,folio:F.6.a}}} I think I will go before the Blessed One and ask him what the cause and condition of these incredible and miraculous appearances in the world could be.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-39}} Accordingly, Brahmā Great Compassionate One disappeared from the Brahmā realm, accompanied by a host of 6,800,000 Brahmā gods, and instantly appeared in the sky before the Blessed One in the jeweled pavilion. He bowed with joined palms and prostrated to the Blessed One. Then he asked, “Blessed One, what is happening? The worlds of the trichiliocosm are filled with water like an ocean, and trillions of lotuses are floating here and there with sublime beings seated on each of them. Yet, Blessed One, still all the villages, cities, towns, lands, regions, and palaces can be seen clearly. Additionally, all the Jambudvīpas, four-continent worlds, oceans, Mount Merus, and gods of the desire realm are clearly visible, just as they normally are. Blessed One, I am wondering whose blessings this represents? I am amazed. Whose omen is this?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-40}} The Blessed One answered Brahmā Great Compassionate One, saying, “Brahmā, the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati and countless other bodhisattva great beings have arrived from the blessed thus-gone Master of the Ocean with Noble and Playful Super-knowledge’s {{page:{number:11,folio:F.6.b}}} buddha realm Adorned with Immaculate and Countless Precious Qualities here to the Sahā world to behold, venerate, and honor me, and to ask questions about the present Dharma teaching, which is a section of the Great Compilation . The fact that the worlds of the trichiliocosm appear to be filled with water like an ocean is the manifestation of his blessings.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-41}} “Blessed One, is that Dharma teaching, which is a section of the Great Compilation , still being taught?”
“Brahmā, the Thus-Gone One’s eloquence is without any interruption. Even when you perceive that the Blessed One is not saying anything, I am still authentically delivering Dharma teachings to bodhisattvas gathered from throughout the worlds of the ten directions. Brahmā, the Buddha’s domain is as unfathomable as this.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-43}} “Blessed One, which one is this emanated bodhisattva great being called Sāgaramati?”
“Brahmā,” answered the Blessed One, “do you see the billions of beings prostrating to the jeweled lion throne the height of seven palm trees on the central heart of that lotus, which is ten miles wide?”
“Blessed One, I do.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-46}} The Blessed One then asked, “Brahmā, do you see the bodhisattva with the golden complexion {{page:{number:12,folio:F.7.a}}} on the lion throne—the one whose body is adorned with the major and minor marks of perfection, the one whose body outshines all the other bodhisattvas except for the body of the Thus-Gone One, the one who is being prostrated to by many bodhisattvas?”
“Blessed One, I do.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-48}} “Brahmā,” said the Blessed One, “he is called the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati. All of this is his manifestation.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-49}} Brahmā Great Compassionate One then prostrated to the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati and exclaimed, “Blessed One, may all beings witness such miraculous wonders! Any being who hears Bodhisattva Sāgaramati’s name definitely gains a great boon! Blessed One, even I have received a great boon in hearing the name of this sublime being and seeing his form. Blessed One, how long will that Dharma teaching, which is a section of the Great Compilation , be taught?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-50}} “Brahmā,” responded the Blessed One, “for as long as the lifespan of the Thus-Gone One lasts, and even after the Thus-Gone One has passed into parinirvāṇa, for as long as these bodhisattvas uphold, recite, teach, and spread this Dharma teaching. Why is this? Because, Brahmā, the awakening of all the blessed buddhas of the past, present, and future is subsumed within this teaching.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-51}} The bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati then rose into the sky the height of seven palm trees upon his lotus and lion throne and spoke the following verses in order to bring extensive and genuine joy to the entire assembly, to arouse the interest of Brahmā Great Compassionate One, to ornament this Dharma teaching, and to demonstrate the power of his insight {{page:{number:13,folio:F.7.b}}} and eloquence:
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-52}} “Below, past as many realms as there are atoms in a billion buddha realms, Lives a perfected bodhisattva, replete with all qualities and beauty. In his unequaled mind is found the ocean of the guides’ teachings. From him I heard the Dharma of the sages and took it to heart.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-56}} “We have come here to see the one with ten strengths, To venerate him, and to converse with the foremost bodhisattvas.” By venerating you, Protector, I prostrate to you, unequaled Dharma king, And offer to you effulgent and extensive veneration fit for a buddha.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-60}} “You do not conceptualize form as form, and for you, feeling is unconditioned. Even consciousness is eternally pure during the three types of feeling. You understand that being a leader is not about reputation, birth, or caste. Insightful Dharma king, you see what is immaculate and authentic.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-64}} “You neither take up nor avoid either extreme of self or nonself. You are inwardly peaceful, your mind is at peace, and you are not drawn outwardly. The Sage’s mind is like space: without thought, conceptuality, or mental processes. I honor those who hoist the Dharma banner of the blissful ones in the ten directions.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-68}} “For you gifts are emptiness, like receiving an illusion. With an unmoving mind, you give away treasures with no hope of return. For the sake of awakening your view is certain; you entertain no uncertain concepts. You are the donor free of stinginess who grants beings deliverance from their faults.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-72}} “Having found peace, you are free from the torments of speech, mind, and body. Having no torments, you are freed from vast bondage and gentle, with peaceful faculties. {{page:{number:14,folio:F.8.a}}} With the knowledge {{note:{index:10,id:UT22084-058-001-75}}} of selflessness, you do not apprehend awakening, yet do not lose it. With discipline and insight, you wish to put an end to faulty discipline and remain pure in discipline.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-77}} “Realizing the fleeting nature of things, there is nothing to say about objects of knowledge. With your space-like mind you see all beings as illusions. Even if your body were to be chopped into bits, it would arouse no anger. Learned one, maintaining the disciplined conduct of awakening, you advocate patience.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-81}} “Realizing that phenomena are like water-moons, bubbles, illusions, and optical distortions, You see there is no person, life-force, or son of Manu. Without apprehending awakening or groups of beings you still seek awakening for others’ sake, And in this way you are fearless and take diligence to its farthest reaches.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-85}} “Your mind is not attached to objects and harbors no doubt. It knows the thoughts of other beings throughout the three times. Your mind is unknown by the demon of the thinking mind. Your intelligence is firmly grounded in the perfections, concentration, and super-knowledges.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-89}} “The eloquence of one who hears the buddhas’ speech and correctly upholds it Remains uninterrupted even if one speaks for fathomless eons. The one who attains buddha qualities without becoming a sentient being exists nowhere. With that insight—a treasure of the blessed sages’ wisdom—one is heroic in the three worlds.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-93}} “Whoever has gone to the other shore of the perfections has neither gone nor not gone. Perfecting beings’ conduct, one is neither static nor moving. Perfecting all qualities, one harbors no arrogance about such qualities. One will bow to the foremost buddha of the Śākyas, the Lord of Sages.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-97}} “The pure radiance of the sun overwhelms the light cast by fireflies. The tall flames at the end of an eon consume the entire earth. Mount Meru, the king of mountains, puts all other earthly mountains to shame. {{page:{number:15,folio:F.8.b}}} A single hair of the leader of the Śākyas outshines any other light in the three worlds.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-101}} “Every bodhisattva leader who has come here from many different realms Is satisfied by your complexion and radiance, Lord. Their perception accords with the aspirations they have made. We knew you were here in your field before we ever left our own.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-105}} “Wherever beings perceive, there your speech reaches, Manifesting in all languages present throughout the three realms of existence. Atomic particles and the thoughts of humans could be counted, Yet the infinite utterances of the Sage’s voice, like space itself, defy quantification.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-109}} “The reaches of space and the extent of humans cannot be reckoned, And the extent of saṃsāra’s past is absolutely unfathomable. Even if it were possible for somebody to quantify space or saṃsāra’s extent, They could never grasp the domain of the buddhas’ wisdom, absorption, and discipline.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-113}} “Your praises would be difficult to express even in the course of countless eons. Guide, Lord of Dharma, immeasurable leader, to you we prostrate. Beings realize the eminence of buddhas according to their understanding and inclinations. They will see the Guide as unfathomably intelligent, astonishing, and utterly superior.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-117}} When he had spoken these verses, the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati descended from the sky. With his palms joined together, he bowed toward the Blessed One and said, “If I were to request a teaching, would the Blessed One honor my request? I have a few questions for the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-118}} The Blessed One replied to the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati, {{page:{number:16,folio:F.9.a}}} “Noble son, you may ask the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha whatever you like. Then I will answer your questions and gladden your mind.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-119}} So, the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, there is an absorption of the bodhisattva great beings called the pristine and immaculate seal . I have heard that if bodhisattva great beings rest in this absorption, they will fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. How is this absorption of the pristine and immaculate seal of the bodhisattva great beings attained? Why is it said to be pristine and immaculate? Blessed Thus-Gone One, please elucidate this! Once bodhisattva great beings have been introduced to the means by which one enters this absorption, they will attain it and fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood in a swift manner. Blessed Thus-Gone One, please elucidate this!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-120}} The Blessed One then responded to the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati, saying, “Excellent, excellent, sublime being. Yes, this question is excellent and your concern is appropriate. Thus, noble son, listen well and bear what I say in mind. I will elucidate how bodhisattva great beings can attain this absorption of the pristine and immaculate seal and swiftly and fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood.” {{page:{number:17,folio:F.9.b}}}
“Wonderful, Blessed One!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-122}} The bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati then listened as the Blessed One had instructed, while the Blessed One spoke.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-123}} “Sāgaramati, bodhisattva great beings attain stability {{note:{index:11,id:UT22084-058-001-124}}} due to their roots of virtue. They possess virtuous thoughts, keep to gentle {{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-058-001-125}}} aggregates, gather accumulations, have sharp faculties, are accepted by spiritual friends, are blessed by buddhas, and are skilled in debate. They please, serve, honor, respect, and venerate blessed buddhas. They behold the perfect appearance of the blessed buddhas and hear their speech. They also behold perfect assemblies and listen to their unobstructed wisdom. They witness how beings are guided through miraculous displays, miraculous discourses, and miraculous teachings, and they develop great compassion for beings. Having developed the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening, they are diligent. They engage in the pursuit of virtuous qualities and practice to purify the mind by not forgetting the wisdom of omniscience. As their minds are purified, they attain pure absorption.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-126}} “Sāgaramati, I will draw an analogy. When a precious gem of the finest class comes into the possession of a skilled jeweler, he will refine it so that it becomes perfectly pure, pristine, polished, and flawless. At that point, learned people with knowledge of precious gems will assemble. Sāgaramati, likewise, once bodhisattvas develop the precious gem of the finest class, which is the mind directed toward omniscience, {{page:{number:18,folio:F.10.a}}} they fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. Bodhisattva great beings will then purify their roots of virtue and their learning to the degree that they have eliminated stains, including the stain of arrogance. At that point, once they have refined the precious gem of the mind directed toward omniscience, they attract the blessed buddhas of the ten directions and attain this pristine and immaculate absorption seal.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-127}} “Sāgaramati, I will draw another analogy: There is a precious gem of the finest class that surpasses the nine types of precious substances—gold, silver, crystal, beryl, emerald, coral, red pearl, kesara, and śrīgarbha. Surpassing these nine types of precious substances, this great jewel, which is known as “stainless and immaculate light,” is more precious than any other gem. It is only found in the possession of a universal monarch, and not with any other ordinary being. The luster of this precious gem eclipses the luster of any other precious gem. Sāgaramati, likewise the jewel of developing the mind directed toward omniscience surpasses nine other types of jewels—the jewel of ordinary beings’ virtue, the jewel of faithful followers, the jewel of Dharma followers, the jewel of those who maintain signlessness, the jewel of stream-enterers, the jewel of once-returners, {{page:{number:19,folio:F.10.b}}} the jewel of non-returners, the jewel of worthy ones, and the jewel of solitary buddhas. It surpasses these nine types of jewels. This jewel of developing the mind directed toward omniscience is born from a tenth class of jewel, the outlook of great compassion blessed by the buddhas. Once purified, this jewel will outshine all hearers and solitary buddhas, and illuminate the minds of all beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-128}} “Sāgaramati, I will draw another analogy: That great precious gem can withstand both refinement and harm without its core being impaired. As such it can benefit beings who have created merit and developed roots of virtue. Sāgaramati, likewise, the jewel of developing the mind directed toward omniscience can withstand both refinement and harm without its core being impaired. As such, this faultless jewel of developing the mind directed toward omniscience can benefit all beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-129}} “How is the jewel that develops the mind directed toward omniscience refined, Sāgaramati? Through the three vows, one purifies the path of the ten virtuous actions. Through training in love, one develops love and appreciation for all beings. Through training in compassion, one becomes diligent in considering beings’ affairs. Through training in joy, one brings all beings to the Dharma. Through training in equanimity, one will keep an honest mind and never harm beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-130}} “By eliminating hypocrisy and pretense, one will turn to what is of benefit and one will be motivated to endeavor in all roots of virtue. By being intelligent, one will come to possess mindfulness and awareness. {{page:{number:20,folio:F.11.a}}} By taming the mind, the mind becomes pliant. By being easily content, one comes to adopt ascetic qualities and the ways of living with fewer things. By being easily sustained, one acquires the contentment of the noble family and bows before teachers and those who are worthy of offerings.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-131}} “By eliminating pride, one discards all arrogance and dispute. By coming to certainty, one discards all forms of pride. By eliminating all turbidity, the mind is clarified. Through not praising oneself, one comes to understand oneself. Through never slandering others, one protects beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-132}} “By seeing the Dharma as medicine, one is respectful of it. Through experiencing the meaning of the Dharma, one will pursue it. By becoming immersed in it, one yearns for the Dharma. By living without afflictive emotions, one delights in the Dharma. By discarding everything that is not Dharma, one seeks the Dharma. By being constantly conscientious, one’s faith in the Three Jewels is never broken. By trusting in the ripening of karma, one will contemplate all virtues to be performed.

They will not lose their accumulation of merit that manifests the major and minor marks of perfection. They will not lose the effort needed to actualize the purification of buddha realms.

They will accept any ridicule, threats, bad words, or cruel words spoken by beings. They will accept all harm caused by beings. They will accept the burden of all beings. Since they are liberated, they reveal their strength by not becoming sad, discouraged, depressed, disheartened, or doubtful. They will arouse their strength, develop their diligence, bring forth their effort, inspire enthusiasm, and not engage in any deluded states of mind. Though mocked, they will not return it with ridicule. Though struck, they will not strike back. Though shown anger, they will not be angry in return.

The mind of generosity, the mind of discipline, the mind of patience, the mind of diligence, the mind of concentration, the mind of insight, and the mind of the roots of virtue that come from study would arise. In such places, then even if beings were to chop my body up into a hundred pieces, and crush and scatter it like juniper leaves—even if those beings were to do nothing but scold me, slander me, belittle me, complain about me, and speak nothing but nasty things about me—still I would not allow my mind to become disturbed.

Wherever I have taken a body—in the realms of hell, animals, the Lord of Death, or that of humans—I have been stained by the enjoyment of desire. I lacked the study of Dharma and sustained myself on dangerous forms of livelihood that ended up being fruitless.

Chapter Three: The Teaching on the Absorption
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-539}} The Blessed One then spoke to the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati: “Along these lines, Sāgaramati, when bodhisattva great beings become completely pure, they have a genuinely good motivation and, even if all beings were to rise up to challenge them, they would not be angered. They develop the wisdom of deep certainty and the insight free from doubt. At that time, they sustain the fundamental state of the pristine and immaculate absorption seal. What is the fundamental state of this absorption? {{page:{number:44,folio:F.23.a}}} It is great compassion that knows no anger toward any being.

It is satisfied with its form but not puffed up; it is not proud of its greatness. {{page:{number:45,folio:F.23.b}}} Bearing all such qualities, it still bows to and pays respect to all beings no matter how inferior and flawed their forms may be. Through the nature of their own bodies, bodhisattvas develop knowledge of the identical nature of all beings’ bodies. With regard to the body, knowing its nature it is a Dharma body, not a material body.

A limpid mind is the mind that has a luminous nature, wherein there is no opportunity for adventitious afflictive emotions to occur. Its quality of luminosity is unchanging. It is completely free from mental engagement. It is free of attachment and thus unpolluted. It is free of aggression and nonconceptual. It is free of dullness and free of darkness. It arises from a state that is pure, pristine, immaculate, and liberated.

In the same way it is liberated, so are all phenomena—they are the same as emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, the unconditioned, the non-arising, the unborn, and the unceasing. In the same way it is liberated, so are all conditioned phenomena—they are the same as the sameness of unconditioned phenomena.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-686}} “This wisdom that accords with sameness, and that does not pick up or put down anything, is called the limpid mind.

“Yes, because it is free of the dust of attachment.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-711}} “Blessed One, this absorption is unmoving!”
“Yes, because it does not move within the three realms.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-713}} “Blessed One, this absorption is conceptually unstructured!”
“Yes, because it is free from all conceptual structuring.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-715}} “Blessed One, this absorption does not fluctuate!”
“Yes, because it is final.”

{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-720}} “To draw an analogy, Sāgaramati, if someone wanted to wage war on the sky, they should don the armor of the sky. Sāgaramati, when one desires to attain the pristine and immaculate absorption seal, one should don the armor of the sameness of all phenomena. Why is this? Sāgaramati, attainment is determined by one’s preparations.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-721}} “Sāgaramati, consciousness is the seed of the conditioned. Non-cognition is the seed of the unconditioned, and this absorption is the seed of non-cognition. This absorption cannot be perceived by the eye consciousness, nor by the consciousness of the ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind. {{page:{number:59,folio:F.30.b}}} This absorption cannot be realized by cognizing or feeling it; this absorption has the characteristic of being without feeling and cognition. Because it realizes all phenomena to be sameness, it is called perfect buddhahood.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-722}} “Sāgaramati, I did not understand pollution through some other characteristic. Nor did I understand purification through some other characteristic. Why is this? The basic characteristic of pollution is the same as purification. Their basic characteristic is that they are naturally pure. The basic characteristic of being naturally pure is to be without characteristics. Being without characteristics is signlessness. There is nothing in signlessness that can be discerned.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-723}} “Sāgaramati, no phenomenon can be cognized nor is to be cognized. Language does not occur where no phenomenon can be cognized nor is to be cognized. Where no language occurs, things are just as they are. How are things just as they are? As it was before, so will it be after. Thus, all phenomena are said to be empty throughout the three times. Why are they described as emptiness? They have not been made, will not be made, are not being made, and are not in a process of making. Thus, they are called emptiness.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-724}} “What does not being made refer to? It refers to being unconditioned. Because they are not being made, there are no phenomena that have been made.

It refers to being without any physical, verbal, or mental formations. {{page:{number:60,folio:F.31.a}}} That is what is meant by being unconditioned. What is not made is unconditioned: it is unborn, indestructible, baseless. What is unborn, indestructible, and baseless has no basis. In what way is it baseless? It is not based on anything that has been formed. Thus, it is said to be without a base. In this regard, a consciousness that gravitates toward form is baseless. A consciousness that moves toward feeling, perception , formation, or consciousness is likewise baseless. A baseless consciousness is replete with wisdom. One who is replete with wisdom is prevented by wisdom from becoming conceited. One who is prevented from becoming conceited cannot become arrogant. One who cannot become arrogant does not debate. One who does not debate does not become inflamed. One who does not become inflamed is not pained. One who is not pained does not smolder. One who does not smolder is at peace. One who is at peace is utterly peaceful. One who is utterly peaceful is deeply at peace. One who is deeply at peace is called a sage—who is called a teacher.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-725}} “Sāgaramati, these points are so profound, so difficult to see, and so difficult to realize. Anyone who hears these teachings and is inspired by them will be liberated from error, and the perpetuation of affliction, grasping, and bondage. They will uphold the Dharma treasury of the blessed buddhas of the past, present, and future. They will be great captains who teach limitless paths to beings. They will be the foremost physicians who heal the formless disease of afflictive emotions. {{page:{number:61,folio:F.31.b}}} They will venerate the thus-gone ones with the finest offerings. Before long, they will attain the pristine and immaculate absorption seal. They will find certainty in the Great Vehicle. They will make good use of the great raft of Dharma.

Chapter Four: Teaching Through Analogies
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-727}} The bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati then asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, how do bodhisattvas defeat māras and obstructers?”
“Sāgaramati,” answered the Blessed One, “when bodhisattva great beings are no longer interested in any clinging, they defeat māras and obstructers. When they are no longer interested in marks and reference points, they defeat māras and obstructers. Sāgaramati, there are four māras: the māra of the aggregates, the māra of the afflictions, the māra of the Lord of Death, and the māra of the gods.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-729}} “Regarding this, the māra of the aggregates is defeated by contemplating how phenomena are illusory. The māra of the afflictions is defeated by reflection on emptiness. The māra of the Lord of Death is defeated by contemplating the unborn and non-arising. The māra of the gods is defeated by the path that halts all imputations made out of pride.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-730}} “Moreover, the māra of the aggregates is defeated by understanding suffering. The māra of the afflictions is defeated by abandoning the origin.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-731}} “Moreover, the māra of the aggregates is defeated by realizing formations to be suffering. The māra of the afflictions is defeated by realizing formations to be impermanent. The māra of the Lord of Death is defeated by realizing phenomena to be selfless. The māra of the gods is defeated by realizing that nirvāṇa is peace.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-732}} “Moreover, Sāgaramati, when bodhisattvas discard the stains of their inner afflictions, practice giving without forgetting the mind of awakening, and dedicate this toward omniscience, they destroy the māra of the aggregates. When bodhisattvas practice giving without consideration for, or attachment to, the body and dedicate this to omniscience, they destroy the māra of the afflictions. When bodhisattvas practice giving with the thought, ‘Ah, I shall make good use of these possessions of mine that are otherwise impermanent and ordinary,’ and dedicate this to omniscience, they destroy the māra of the Lord of Death. When bodhisattvas develop great compassion for all beings, practice giving in order to attract all beings and liberate them, and dedicate this to omniscience, they destroy the māra of the gods.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-733}} “Moreover, Sāgaramati, bodhisattvas destroy the māra of the aggregates by maintaining discipline without any desire to prolong their rebirths in saṃsāra. Bodhisattvas destroy the māra of the afflictions by maintaining discipline within the view of selflessness. Bodhisattvas destroy the māra of the Lord of Death by maintaining discipline in order to undermine aging and death with pure discipline. Bodhisattvas destroy the māra of the gods by maintaining discipline with the intention that they will establish all beings that have corrupt discipline in the discipline of noble beings. {{page:{number:63,folio:F.32.b}}}

Bodhisattvas destroy the māra of the afflictions by cultivating patience without apprehending beings. Bodhisattva destroy the māra of the Lord of Death by cultivating patience without apprehending saṃsāra. Bodhisattvas destroy the māra of the gods by cultivating patience without apprehending nirvāṇa.

Bodhisattvas transcend the māra of the afflictions by practicing diligence while disengaging from the mind. Bodhisattvas transcend the māra of the Lord of Death by practicing diligence in the midst of the unborn and non-arising. Bodhisattvas transcend the māra of the gods by practicing diligence for the sake of ripening beings and upholding the Dharma without being saddened by saṃsāra.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-736}} “Moreover, Sāgaramati, bodhisattvas transcend the māra of the aggregates by practicing concentration without sustaining the aggregates. Bodhisattvas transcend the māra of the afflictions by practicing concentration without sustaining the elements. Bodhisattvas transcend the māra of the Lord of Death by practicing concentration without sustaining the sense sources. Bodhisattvas transcend the māra of the gods by dedicating these aspects of practicing concentration to awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-737}} “Moreover, Sāgaramati, bodhisattvas find victory over the māra of the aggregates by utilizing insight to become learned in the aggregates. Bodhisattvas find victory over the māra of the afflictions by utilizing insight to become learned in the elements. Bodhisattvas find victory over the māra of the Lord of Death by utilizing insight to become learned in the sense sources. Bodhisattvas find victory over the māra of the gods by utilizing insight to become learned in dependent origination and thus not actualizing the limit of reality.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-738}} “Moreover, Sāgaramati, the māra of the aggregates has no chance when bodhisattvas aspire to the emptiness of all phenomena. The māra of the afflictions has no chance when bodhisattvas trust that all phenomena are signless. {{page:{number:64,folio:F.33.a}}} The māra of the Lord of Death has no chance when bodhisattvas have no doubt that all phenomena are the wishless state. The māra of the gods has no chance when bodhisattvas have no doubt that phenomena are unconditioned, and do not become arrogant even if they gather roots of virtue.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-739}} “Moreover, Sāgaramati, when bodhisattvas cultivate the application of mindfulness of body to the body and do not form the concepts that go along with the body, they defeat the māra of the aggregates. When bodhisattvas cultivate the application of mindfulness of feelings to feelings and do not form the concepts that go along with feelings, they defeat the māra of the afflictions.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-740}} “Sāgaramati, all of the māras’ activities are motivated by the workings of the self. Thus, bodhisattvas do not motivate themselves by the workings of the self. The self is not a self, but is selfless, so there is no phenomenon than can generate the self. Cognizing this with discriminating wisdom, bodhisattvas don the armor of the Great Vehicle for the sake of ignorant beings, not because they impute self or other. When wearing this armor, they will ask themselves how to make this armor meaningful. They think the following: {{page:{number:65,folio:F.33.b}}} ‘I am not wearing this armor so that I may dismantle the self, nor am I am wearing it so that I may dismantle a being, a life force, sustenance, a person, or personhood. Instead, I will abandon the entire basis for beings to sustain the view of self, beings, life force, sustenance, people, or personhood. What is this basis? The basis is being mistaken. The aggregates, elements, and sense sources are the basis. As their minds are mistaken in this regard, beings perceive what is impermanent to be permanent, what is suffering to be happiness, what is not a self to be a self, and what is ugly to be attractive. Now, so that they may come to understand perception , I will teach them the Dharma.’
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-741}} “What does it mean to understand perception ? It is to be without grasping or clinging. When one does not grasp, one does not cling. When one does not cling, there is no delusion. When there is no delusion, one understands perception .”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-742}} “Does one then understand past, present, or future perceptions ?” asked Sāgaramati.
“Neither past, nor present, nor future perceptions ! Why is this? Past perceptions are exhausted. Present perceptions do not remain. Future perceptions have not yet come.

Sāgaramati, by putting forth this quality of effort, I distinguished myself from hundreds of thousands of other bodhisattvas.

Chapter Six: Teaching on the Qualities of Buddhahood
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1103}} Then, Mahābrahmā Great Compassionate One asked the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati, “Noble son, what does the term qualities of buddhahood refer to?”
Bodhisattva Sāgaramati responded, “Brahmā, ‘the qualities of buddhahood’ refers to all phenomena. {{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-058-001-1105}}} Why is this? Brahmā, a thus-gone one does not awaken to perfect buddhahood in a restricted and limited manner. Rather, a thus-gone one awakens to perfect buddhahood in an unrestricted and unlimited manner {{page:{number:92,folio:F.47.a}}} due to realizing the sameness of all phenomena. Brahmā, realizing all phenomena to be sameness is awakening. Therefore, Brahmā, all phenomena are qualities of buddhahood. Brahmā, all phenomena are precisely the qualities of buddhahood. The essence of all phenomena is the essence of all the qualities of buddhahood. The qualities of buddhahood are realized to be disengaged because all phenomena are disengaged. Because all phenomena are empty, the qualities of buddhahood are realized as emptiness. Brahmā, because all phenomena are dependently originated, realizing dependent origination is awakening. The qualities of buddhahood are seen by a thus-gone one in the same way that all phenomena are seen.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1106}} “Noble son,” asked Mahābrahma Great Compassionate One, “do the qualities of buddhahood not transcend the three realms?”
“Brahmā,” replied Sāgaramati, “the essential quality of the three realms is to possess the qualities of buddhahood. Why is this? Brahmā, in the sameness of the qualities of buddhahood, there is no better or worse. Analogously, Brahmā, in space there is no better or worse. Likewise, Brahmā, the qualities of buddhahood are equal to space, wherein there is nothing better or worse. Brahmā, the nature of all phenomena is that they are empty by their very nature, meaning there is nothing better or worse. Brahmā, a noble son or daughter who wishes to realize the qualities of buddhahood should realize the qualities of buddhahood in a nonconceptual manner. Furthermore, Brahmā, the qualities of buddhahood do not persist in objects, nor in any direction. They are unborn and unceasing. They are not like the colors blue, {{page:{number:93,folio:F.47.b}}} yellow, red, white, green, crystal, or silver; in fact, they have no color, shape, or characteristics. They are signless. Brahmā, the meaning of signlessness is the meaning of the qualities {{note:{index:23,id:UT22084-058-001-1108}}} of buddhahood. The meaning of the qualities of buddhahood is the meaning of the words ‘without death or transmigration.’ The meaning of the words without death or transmigration is the meaning of peace. The meaning of peace is the meaning of disengaged. The meaning of disengaged is the meaning of empty. The meaning of empty is the meaning of unenduring. The meaning of unenduring is the meaning of thatness. The meaning of thatness is the meaning of unborn. The meaning of unborn is the meaning of unceasing. The meaning of unceasing is the meaning of unenduring.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1109}} “Of this we can say:
“To express the meaning of signlessness Is to refer to the sublime qualities of buddhahood. To express the meaning of the qualities of buddhahood Is to refer to ‘no death or transmigration.’
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1114}} “The meaning of no death or transmigration is peace, And that was proclaimed to be the meaning of disengagement. The meaning of disengagement is the meaning of empty, And that is the meaning of unenduring.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1118}} “The meaning of unenduring is thatness, And the meaning of that is suchness, Which was proclaimed to be the meaning of Being without birth or cessation.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1122}} “The meaning of unceasing is the meaning of unenduring. The meaning of this quality of being unenduring Is that all phenomena endure in the same manner As the realm of phenomena.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1128}} “The qualities of training also endure In the same way as the qualities of buddhahood. The qualities of nonattachment have the same meaning As they do not endure in any other way.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1188}} Mahābrahma Great Compassionate One further asked the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati, “Noble son, do you directly perceive these qualities?”
“Brahmā, do you think that the qualities of buddhahood can be counted among form?”
“No, they cannot.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1191}} “Brahmā, can phenomena that are formless, unidentifiable, unobstructing, and uncognizable be directly perceived?”
“Noble son, they cannot.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1193}} “In this way, Brahmā, the qualities of buddhahood are imperceptible. Why is this? Because there is not even the slightest duality. Brahmā, all phenomena are nondual. All that is perceptible is of that very characteristic. Brahmā, what is perceptible and the qualities of buddhahood are not different. Whatever is perceptible is also whatever is a quality of buddhahood. Whatever is a quality of buddhahood is also whatever is perceptible.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1194}} “Noble son, are the qualities of buddhahood not perceptible to the thus-gone ones?”
“Brahmā, if there were any quality of buddhahood, which would be established as a quality of the thus-gone ones or the buddhas, it would also be perceptible to the thus-gone ones.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1196}} “Noble son, are the qualities of buddhahood totally nonexistent?”
“Brahmā, any phenomenon that is not established cannot be asserted as being existent or nonexistent. Any phenomenon that cannot be asserted as being existent or nonexistent is not perceptible.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1198}} “Well then, what do we mean by the term qualities of buddhahood ?”
“Brahmā, I will draw an analogy. Even though we still use the term space to refer to space, it is not established in any way. Likewise, Brahmā, even though we use the term qualities of buddhahood to refer to the qualities of buddhahood, they are not established in any way.” {{page:{number:96,folio:F.49.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1200}} “Noble son, it is incredible that novice bodhisattvas are not intimidated when they hear this teaching, for they don armor for the sake of attaining these very qualities of buddhahood.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1201}} “Brahmā, beings who have been blessed by the buddhas develop the mind of awakening and are not intimidated when they hear of the profound qualities of buddhahood. Brahmā, if one grasps and clings, then one will be intimidated. If one does not grasp or cling, then one will not be intimidated. If one exists or desires, then one will be intimidated. If one does not exist or desire, then one will not be intimidated. If one clings to ‘I’ or ‘mine,’ then one will be intimidated. If one does not cling to ‘I’ or ‘mine,’ then one will not be intimidated.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1202}} “What power do bodhisattvas possess such that they are not intimidated by the profound qualities of buddhahood? What is this bodhisattva power?”
“Brahmā, this bodhisattva power, which prevents bodhisattvas from being intimidated by the profound qualities of buddhahood, is eightfold. What are these eight? (1) Aspiring to the qualities of buddhahood, they have the power of unobstructed faith. (2) Recognizing their similarity with the teacher, they have the power of the spiritual friend that comes from respect. (3) Perfecting transcendental qualities, they have the power of insight that comes from study. (4) Perfecting immeasurable merit, they have the power of service that comes from merit. (5) Having defeated all māras, they have the power of wisdom that comes from approaching reality. (6) Without any apprehension about the fact that all phenomena are selfless, they have the power of great compassion that comes from great love. (7) Never forgetting the mind of awakening, they have the power of mind that comes from certainty. (8) Attaining the acceptance that phenomena are unborn, they have the power of acceptance that comes from not being led around by others. Brahmā, if bodhisattvas have this power that is replete with these eight qualities, {{page:{number:97,folio:F.49.b}}} then they will not be intimidated by the profound qualities of buddhahood.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1204}} Then the Blessed One expressed his approval of Sāgaramati: “Sāgaramati, you have explained well these bodhisattva powers. Excellent, excellent! There are no qualities of buddhahood that could intimidate a bodhisattva who has this kind of power. All the sounds of this teaching by Sāgaramati are terrifying. Ultimate awakening is inexpressible. Why is this? What is inexpressible cannot be explained and does not conform with letters. If the mind and mental phenomena themselves cannot be formed, how could they possibly conform to letters? This profound teaching is beyond language, unexplainable, inexpressible, and unspeakable. However, even though this is understood, it can still be taught to other beings and people through knowledge of language. Just consider how the great compassion of the blessed buddhas can be introduced to an unfathomable number of beings. Sāgaramati, to draw an analogy, imagine that somebody painted an image with various colors on space, which is formless, inexpressible, unobstructing, and uncognizable. Imagine that this person painted horses, elephants, chariots, infantrymen, and mounts, or that they painted an image of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and gandharvas. Sāgaramati, do you think that being would have done something difficult?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1205}} “Blessed One, that person would definitely have done something difficult. Blissful One, he or she would have done something extraordinarily difficult!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1206}} “Sāgaramati,” said the Blessed One, “that the blessed buddhas express the inexpressible to other beings and people once they have understood the inexpressible qualities of buddhahood, {{page:{number:98,folio:F.50.a}}} and thus bring forth a recognition and understanding in them, is even more difficult than that. It is even harder than that to not be intimidated, apprehensive, or fearful about these profound qualities of buddhahood. Sāgaramati, beings who are not intimidated by these profound qualities of buddhahood have already developed roots of virtue and served the victors of the past.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1299}} “Noble son,” answered the Blessed One, “that is true. You have described it accurately. Any phenomenon that I understand is indescribable. However, noble son, while all phenomena are indescribable and unconditioned, {{page:{number:103,folio:F.52.b}}} using linguistic definitions to apprehend, perceive, teach, demonstrate, define, elucidate, distinguish, clarify, or teach such phenomena is what is meant by upholding the Dharma. Moreover, noble son, when Dharma teachers uphold, teach, or practice a sūtra such as this, that is also upholding the Dharma. Likewise, when others attend such Dharma teachers and rely upon them while extending them honor, reverence, service, respect, praise, care, protection, shielding, and shelter, that is also upholding the Dharma. Likewise, so is providing them with clothing, food, bedding, medicine, or provisions; as is offering them approval, protection, preservation of their virtues, praise, or concealment of their unflattering sides. Moreover, noble son, having faith in emptiness, trusting signlessness, believing in wishlessness, and gaining certainty that suchness is the unconditioned state is also upholding the sublime Dharma. Moreover, noble son, seeking to avoid debate, yet using proper Dharma arguments to defeat those who argue against the Dharma, is also upholding the sublime Dharma. Moreover, noble son, giving Dharma to others with a mind free of anger, an intention to gather and free beings, and a mind free of concern for material things, is also upholding the sublime Dharma. Moreover, noble son, disregarding one’s body and life and staying in solitude to preserve, conceal, and practice sūtras such as this is also upholding the sublime Dharma. Moreover, noble son, even a single step or a single inhalation or exhalation of the breath that comes from the cause of having either studied or taught the Dharma {{page:{number:104,folio:F.53.a}}} is also upholding the sublime Dharma. Moreover, noble son, not grasping to or appropriating any phenomena is also upholding the sublime Dharma. Light King of Qualities, based on this explanation, you should understand this point.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1300}} “Noble son, countless eons ago in the past, in the eon called Noble Bliss, in the world Pure Light there was a thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha named Teacher of the Power of Great Wisdom. He was learned and virtuous, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a charioteer who guides beings, an unsurpassed being, a teacher of gods and humans, and a blessed buddha. Noble son, the world Pure Light was made of beryl and was incredibly pure. A light filled the ten directions. The bodhisattva great beings there played in the great power of super-knowledge. It was a place where everyone was freed within the profound Dharma. Their enjoyments were like those of the god Sunirmita, and in their divine bodies they listened to the Dharma of that Blessed One. In that realm, householders and monastics were not involved in distinct activities. The blessed thus-gone Teacher of the Power of Great Wisdom advised everyone to strive to uphold the sublime Dharma without any concern for body or life.

So, to reverse and guard against this, focusing the mind and becoming disciplined, peaceful, tranquil, and gentle is to uphold the sublime Dharma. Why is this? The eye, forms, and visual consciousness are not the Dharma. The ear, sounds, and auditory consciousness; the nose, smells, and olfactory consciousness; the body, objects of touch, and tactile consciousness; and the mind, mental phenomena, and mental consciousness are not the Dharma. So, upholding the sublime Dharma is recognizing the eye and form to be empty, and neither thinking about the eye or form, nor maintaining visual consciousness. Skillfully using pure wisdom to help others understand this is to uphold the sublime Dharma. Likewise, upholding the sublime Dharma is recognizing the ear and sounds, nose and smells, tongue and tastes, body and objects of touch, and mind and mental phenomena to be empty, and neither thinking about them, nor maintaining their corresponding consciousnesses. Skillfully using pure wisdom to help others understand this is upholding the sublime Dharma. Moreover, not grasping at {{page:{number:106,folio:F.54.a}}} or appropriating any phenomena that occur is upholding the sublime Dharma.

My nature is also the nature of the seat of awakening, the nature of awakening itself, the nature of all beings, and the nature of all phenomena. Mañjuśrī, that which I realized at the seat of awakening is also of that same nature. It is of one taste. Even as I fully awakened, the Thus-Gone One saw no phenomena of liberation apart from the seat of awakening. Because awakening is sameness, I realized the sameness of all phenomena. Sameness cannot be reckoned in any way. It is uncountable and immeasurable. Therefore, the thus-gone ones are said to be unconditioned. Mañjuśrī, the thus-gone ones attain the unconditioned and transcend all conditioned things. All who trust this teaching, Mañjuśrī, will be liberated by the Thus-Gone One’s liberation. Yet being liberated, they do not transcend this reality.”

They answered, “The marvelous boon to be gained by such bodhisattvas is tenfold. It is an inconceivably great boon. What are these ten boons? (1) Gaining an opportunity to serve the manifestation of the buddhas. (2) Beyond just seeing them, achieving faith in them with pure motivation.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1730}} Then the bodhisattva great being Prajñākūṭa, who was among the retinue, said to the Blessed One, “As I understand what the Blessed One has just said, then, Blessed One, the appearance of a buddha is the manifestation of the view of the transitory collection. Blessed One, the appearance of a buddha is the manifestation of ignorance, craving, and becoming. Blessed One, the appearance of a buddha is the manifestation of attachment, aggression, and stupidity. Blessed One, the appearance of a buddha is the manifestation of the four errors.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1732}} Then Sāgaramati asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, if novice bodhisattvas do not understand this fact about the appearance of a buddha, do they even perceive the appearance of any buddhas, Blessed One?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1733}} “Sāgaramati, buddhas occur to the degree that one’s mind is pure,” answered the Blessed One. “Why is this? Sāgaramati, there are four types of bodhisattvas. What are they? They are: bodhisattvas who are just giving rise to the mind of awakening, those engaged in conduct, those who are irreversibly destined for awakening, and bodhisattvas in their last life. Sāgaramati, those are the four types of bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1734}} “Sāgaramati, bodhisattvas who are just giving rise to the mind of awakening see the Thus-Gone One in terms of form and physical marks. Bodhisattvas who are engaged in conduct see the Thus-Gone One as the manifestation of qualities. Bodhisattvas who are irreversibly destined for awakening see the Thus-Gone One as characterized by the Dharma body. Sāgaramati, bodhisattvas in their last life do not assert the Thus-Gone One to be a manifestation of form, physical marks, qualities, class, caste, family lineage, or reality. Why is this? Their eyes see with insight. They are grounded in insight. They have merged with insight. Their insight is unmoving and nonconceptual. It is neither seeing nor non-seeing. Why is this? {{page:{number:160,folio:F.81.a}}} Both seeing and non-seeing are extremes. Being free from the two extremes of seeing and non-seeing is to see the Buddha. Seeing the Buddha is to see the self. With pure vision of the self, one attains pure vision of the Buddha. With pure vision of the Buddha, one must gain pure vision of all phenomena. When whatever is seen is pure, that is wisdom vision. That is called seeing the Buddha.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1735}} “Sāgaramati, this is how I saw the Thus-Gone Dīpaṃkara. As soon as I saw him, I attained the acceptance that phenomena are unborn in the manner of non-attainment and non-observation. As soon as I attained that acceptance, I floated upwards to the height of seven palm trees. While present in the midst of space, I considered the endowment of omniscient wisdom. All views ended. I transcended all thoughts, concepts, and notions, and my consciousness no longer dwelled on any objects. I actualized sixty thousand absorptions. The blessed thus-gone Dīpaṃkara then gave the following prophecy: ‘Young brahmin, in the future you will become the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Śākyamuni.’ My ear faculty did not hear this prophecy, nor did I cognize it through some wisdom. But I was also not deluded, and nor did I maintain any view of reference points. I had no notion of buddhas as buddhas. I had no notion of myself as myself. I had no notion of the prophecy as prophecy. Sāgaramati, such is a bodhisattva’s prophecy in terms of the purity of the three spheres. The lack of notions of a buddha, oneself, and a prophecy is called the purity of the three spheres. {{page:{number:161,folio:F.81.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1736}} “Moreover, Sāgaramati, the purity of the three spheres refers to no clinging to self, to beings, or to phenomena. Moreover, the purity of the three spheres refers to no clinging to names, forms, or reference points. Moreover, the purity of the three spheres is knowing the exhaustion of the past, the non-arrival of the future, and the non-existence of the present. Moreover, the purity of the three spheres is knowing the body to be like a reflection, speech to be like an echo, and mind to be like an illusion. Moreover, the purity of the three spheres is the realization that the aggregates are the same as the Dharma aggregate, that the elements are the same as the realm of phenomena, and that the sense sources are like an empty village. Moreover, the purity of the three spheres is trust in emptiness, confidence in signlessness, and certainty in wishlessness. Sāgaramati, the purity of the three spheres will purify all phenomena. Thus, Sāgaramati, bodhisattvas must become skilled in the wisdom of the purity of the three spheres.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1737}} Then the bodhisattva Sāgaramati urged the Blessed One, “Blessed One, the understanding of the profound Dharma held by bodhisattvas who are irreversibly destined for awakening is astounding. Blessed One, please describe the skill in dedication of such bodhisattvas who have this kind of understanding of the Dharma.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1738}} “Sāgaramati,” answered the Blessed One, “bodhisattvas who live by this, act based on their past momentum. {{page:{number:162,folio:F.82.a}}} Even when they are not resting in equipoise, the dedication that they formed in the past continues to have an effect. For that, Sāgaramati, here are some analogies for you to consider, since it is through analogies that some learned people understand what is meant.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1739}} “In this regard, Sāgaramati, consider the following analogy. Suppose that a farmer digs irrigation ditches in all his fields of sugarcane, rice, or grapes. If he directs water along the irrigation channels, then, even when he is resting, the water will flow along the channels that he has dug. The fields will be irrigated with water without him needing to exert himself or focus on the task. Sāgaramati, likewise, even when bodhisattvas are not resting in equipoise, they dedicate their roots of virtue to the mindstreams of all beings. Then, in accordance with how things are, those roots of virtue are also skillfully dedicated toward the qualities of buddhahood. Moreover, as they rest in equipoise in order to purify their minds and guard their discipline, they again dedicate their roots of virtue toward the qualities of buddhahood. It is because they have previously made such excellent aspirations that they are now able to moisten the mindstreams of beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1740}} “Sāgaramati, from this analogy you should understand that because bodhisattvas are propelled by their past roots of virtue, have pliant minds, have undistracted mindfulness, are free from the Lesser Vehicle, and have made aspirations toward the Great Vehicle, they can arise from equilibrium and they will in all cases dedicate their roots of virtue to omniscience.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1741}} “Sāgaramati, to draw another analogy, if a person were to uproot a tree that had been growing in a steep mountain valley, then it would fall in whichever direction it had been leaning or bending toward. {{page:{number:163,folio:F.82.b}}} Likewise, Sāgaramati, by inclining and leaning toward omniscience over a long period of time, bodhisattvas dedicate all the merit that they gather to omniscience. They dedicate it to protect all beings. They dedicate it so that the lineage of the Three Jewels may remain uninterrupted. They dedicate it so their physical manifestation and the major and minor marks may be perfected. They dedicate it so their verbal manifestation and Dharma teachings may be meaningful. They dedicate it so their mental manifestation and the absorption that recollects the Buddha will not get distracted. They dedicate all roots of virtue to omniscience spontaneously and without effort. By dedicating, those who have become skilled in means do not fall prey to other vehicles and it makes no difference whether they are in equipoise or not. It is impossible for them not to complete their cultivation of the factors of awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1742}} “Sāgaramati, to draw another analogy, consider a monk who rests in equipoise within cessation. He may observe the sound of the gaṇḍī , but the sound of the gaṇḍī of course does not exist within the monk’s cessation and it is also not connected to that state. Still, the sound of the gaṇḍī does cause him to emerge from the state of cessation. Likewise, Sāgaramati, bodhisattvas also maintain great compassion in order to free all beings. Thinking, ‘I will protect and liberate all beings!’ they extend a profound love to all beings, that manifests from the aspects of awakening. Then, later, though they rest in a profoundly illuminating absorption that is unmoved by mind, mentation, or consciousness, they will not regress to the level of a hearer or a solitary buddha, because they have previously experienced the great compassion that seeks to free all beings. When they arise from that absorption with mindfulness and awareness, {{page:{number:164,folio:F.83.a}}} they accomplish the factors of awakening and ripen beings. Sāgaramati, even though they rest in equipoise in the absorption of peace in this manner, they will not fall into the liberation of the hearers or solitary buddhas. Such is the unique training of the bodhisattvas!
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1743}} “Sāgaramati, to draw another analogy, there are two people. One of them jumps into a roaring fire while wearing indesctructible armor. Another jumps into a roaring fire while wearing armor made of grass and husks. What do you think happens, Sāgaramati? Which one of them will get burned? Which one will not get burned?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1744}} “Blessed One, the one who jumps into the roaring fire with the indestructible armor will be protected by the indestructible armor. Though he is within the fire, he won’t burn. Blessed One, the one who jumps into the roaring fire with armor made of grass and husks will be immediately burnt. Why is this? Blessed One, because grass and husks are flammable. They cannot offer protection from a roaring fire.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1745}} “Sāgaramati, just as the person wearing indestructible armor is not burned as he jumps into that fire, bodhisattvas wearing the armor of great love and compassion, and the sturdy indestructible armor of intention, focus on freeing beings. They generate a realization of phenomena’s emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, and their unconditioned, unborn, and non-arising quality. Although they rest in equipoise in the absorption of peace, they do not enter into the fixed states of the hearers or solitary buddhas, or try to achieve their results. They experience their absorption, and overcome it and arise from it without detriment or injury, whereupon they purify buddha realms and perfect the wisdom of buddhahood. {{page:{number:165,folio:F.83.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1746}} “Sāgaramati, just as the person is burned by the fire as soon as he jumps in wearing armor made of grass and husks, likewise, Sāgaramati, a person on the vehicle of the hearers is terrified of saṃsāra and considers existence as if it is aflame. Thus, they ignore beings and are without great compassion. Reaching peace and a peaceful absorption, they get stuck and have no chance for further progress. Without attaining the result of the eighth stage, it is impossible for them to arise from their absorption. Why is this? It is because hearers do not gather the accumulations of merit and wisdom. On the other hand, bodhisattvas gather immeasurable accumulations of merit and wisdom. Thus, in the interim before they perfect the qualities of buddhahood, they do not actualize the limit of reality. Sāgaramati, in this way bodhisattvas perceive all phenomena—which are emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, unconditioned, unborn, and non-arising—as a blazing fire and they investigate them. Even though they perceive such phenomena, they must examine them and thus avoid actualizing the limit of reality.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1747}} “For this reason, Sāgaramati, bodhisattvas must be skilled in dedication. Sāgaramati, bodhisattvas who are skilled in dedication perceive profound phenomena, yet for the time being they do not actualize the limit of reality. What does dedication refer to, Sāgaramati? It means to be diligent in, interested in, oriented toward, and directed toward the Great Vehicle and no other vehicle. That is the reason it is called ‘dedication.’
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1748}} “Sāgaramati, to draw an analogy, if a potter places a lump of clay upon his wheel but does not throw it, it cannot rightly be called a pot. It is still considered just a lump of clay. If it is thrown, then it can be called a pot. {{page:{number:166,folio:F.84.a}}} Sāgaramati, likewise, even though bodhisattvas accumulate myriad roots of virtue, if they do not dedicate them to omniscience, they cannot rightly be called perfections. If they are dedicated to omniscience, then they can be called perfections.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1749}} “Sāgaramati, to draw another analogy, if a lump of gold ore is not processed, it cannot rightly be called jewelry. It is still considered a lump of gold. When it has been transformed, then it can be called jewelry. Sāgaramati, likewise, if a bodhisattva’s roots of virtue are not dedicated, they cannot rightly be called perfections. If they are dedicated, then they can be called perfections.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1750}} “Thus, Sāgaramati, bodhisattvas must always gather roots of virtue with an undivided mind and dedicate them to omniscience. Bodhisattvas who dedicate to omniscience engage with profound phenomena and for the time being do not actualize the limit of reality.”
Chapter Ten: A Tale of What Came Before
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1752}} Then the bodhisattva Sāgaramati said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, even though bodhisattvas guard against confusion to this extent, they must work hard to be free from confusion. Blessed One, for that reason bodhisattvas are continuously skilled in dedication and skilled in means. Why is this? Blessed One, through skillful means, when bodhisattvas practice concentration, freedom, absorption, and equipoise, they are not disturbed by the concentration, freedom, absorption, and equipoise. Through skill in means, they demonstrate all these deeds but do not fall prey to doing things. {{page:{number:167,folio:F.84.b}}} They sustain the sameness of phenomena and teach the Dharma in order to bring beings who have gone astray to the fixed state of reality. Until they complete their intention, they do not themselves fall into that state.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1753}} The Blessed One responded to bodhisattva Sāgaramati, “That is how it is, Sāgaramati. You have described it accurately. Bodhisattvas must desire to be completely skilled in means. Why is this? Sāgaramati, awakening is possible for bodhisattvas who are skilled in means but not for those who are not.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1754}} “Sāgaramati, to draw an analogy, imagine that a single container is used to dye three pieces of cloth three different colors (blue, red, and golden yellow). One full measure of cloth is dyed blue, one half measure of cloth is dyed red, and one piece of exquisite and priceless cloth is dyed golden yellow. As they are put into the container and worked over, the cloth will assume the color of the dye that is applied. The cloth that is dyed blue becomes blue, the one that is dyed red becomes red, and the piece that is dyed golden yellow becomes golden yellow. However, the container entertains no concepts about this whatsoever.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1755}} “Similarly, Sāgaramati, one could insert three types of people in the container of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness: a person of the hearer vehicle, a person of the solitary buddha vehicle, and someone who has entered the Great Vehicle. The ‘color’ of wisdom will then adhere to them according to the ‘color’ of their intentions and minds; yet the container of emptiness, signlessness, {{page:{number:168,folio:F.85.a}}} and wishlessness entertains no concepts about this whatsoever. In this regard, the full measure of cloth represents the person of the hearer vehicle, the half measure of cloth represents the person of the solitary buddha vehicle, and the piece of exquisite and priceless cloth represents the person who has entered the Great Vehicle.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1756}} “Sāgaramati, phenomena are without an essence, a creator, a self, a being, a life force, a person, or an owner. With this knowledge one accomplishes what one intends, yet you should know that this accomplishment is not based on intention or comprehension. Sāgaramati, bodhisattvas who aspire to this accomplishment of phenomena do not become weary with any phenomenon. In this manner their wisdom vision is absolutely purified and so for them there can be no benefit or harm. Thus, to the degree that one accurately understands the reality of phenomena in this manner, one will keep the armor of great compassion.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1757}} “Sāgaramati, to draw an analogy, imagine that a priceless, refined, pure, and immaculate beryl stone is cast into the mud and remains there for a thousand years. If after a thousand years it is removed from the mud and washed, cleansed, and wiped down, its pure and immaculate nature will not have been lost. Sāgaramati, likewise, while bodhisattvas know that the nature of all beings’ minds are luminosity, they can see that they are disturbed by adventitious afflictions. Bodhisattvas will think, ‘These afflictions do not affect the luminosity that is the nature of beings’ minds. The afflictions are not themselves genuine; they merely arise from conceptual superimpositions. I will develop the capacity to teach the Dharma so that I may eliminate these adventitious afflictions of beings!’ {{page:{number:169,folio:F.85.b}}} They cannot be discouraged from this attitude and, much further than that, they develop the mind that seeks to free all beings. They will also think, ‘The afflictions do not even have much power or strength. The afflictions are weak and feeble. These afflictions that do not have even the slightest truth are false conceptual superimpositions. They cannot disturb as long as one investigates them with accurate mental engagement. So, I must by all means avoid associating with them. I will investigate them in this manner. Dissociating from the afflictions is excellent. Associating with them is not. If I associate with the afflictions, how could I teach the Dharma in order to eliminate the afflictions of beings who are bound by them? I will dissociate from the afflictions so that I can teach the Dharma to beings such that they may eliminate the afflictions that bind them. In order to ripen beings I will associate with those afflictions that are connected with roots of virtue regarding the continuation of saṃsāra.’
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1758}} “What afflictions are connected with roots of virtue yet perpetuate saṃsāra? They are: being insatiable in the pursuit of roots of virtue, being willing to volitionally take rebirth in existence, aspiring to encounter buddhas, not getting discouraged about ripening beings, being diligent about upholding the sublime Dharma, enthusiasm about considering beings’ actions, not discarding one’s tendency to yearn for the Dharma, and not discarding the trainings in the perfections. Sāgaramati, even if bodhisattvas {{page:{number:170,folio:F.86.a}}} associate with these afflictions that are connected with roots of virtue, they are not marred by any faults of the afflictions.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1759}} “Blessed One,” asked Sāgaramati, “if these are roots of virtue, why do you say they are afflictions?”
“Sāgaramati,” responded the Blessed One, “these afflictions associate a bodhisattva with the three realms. However, although the three realms arise from the afflictions, a bodhisattva who is skilled in means and has developed roots of virtue can volitionally associate with the three realms. Therefore, it is because they cause association with the three realms that they are called the afflictions that are connected with roots of virtue; it is not because they afflict the mind.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1761}} “Sāgaramati, to draw an analogy, imagine that a merchant or a householder has a single son—a beloved, esteemed, pleasing, and agreeable son. Given that he is a child, he might fall into a filthy well while prancing about. When the child’s mother, friends, and relatives find him having fallen into the filthy well, they will scream and lament and cry out, yet they cannot rescue him from that well. Then, the boy’s father arrives and sees his son in the filthy well. He would immediately feel deep love and care, and without blaming the boy, he would swiftly and without delay plunge into that filthy well to free his only son. Sāgaramati, I am relating this analogy so that you will understand something. What meaning should you find in it? Sāgaramati, the filthy well represents the three realms. The only son represents all beings, whom bodhisattvas regard as their only child. The mother, friends, and relatives {{page:{number:171,folio:F.86.b}}} represent people on the vehicles of the hearers and solitary buddhas. When they see that beings fall into saṃsāra, they cry out and lament, but they cannot free them. The merchant or householder represents bodhisattvas, whose minds are pure, immaculate, and stainless. They intentionally take birth in the three realms in order to ripen beings even though they directly experience the unconditioned Dharma. Sāgaramati, this is the great compassion of the bodhisattvas: even though they themselves are absolutely free from the bonds of the afflictions, they elect to be reborn in existence through their skill in means. Because they master insight, they are not harmed by their own afflictions and they teach the Dharma to beings in order to eliminate all binds of the afflictions.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1762}} “Blessed One, bodhisattvas have stainless and immaculate minds, remarked the bodhisattva Sāgaramati. “Even though they accurately realize profound phenomena without denigrating saṃsāra, it must be challenging to avoid attaining the fruition and falling into the unconditioned.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1763}} “Sāgaramati,” replied the Blessed One, “in this regard, the two aspects of the path of the bodhisattvas are the perfection of insight and skill in means. When bodhisattvas have a pure, immaculate, and stainless mind, Sāgaramati, they have the perfection of insight. Sāgaramati, when bodhisattvas do not blame saṃsāra and elect to take rebirth in order to ripen beings, they have skill in means. Additionally, Sāgaramati, when bodhisattvas realize that all conditioned phenomena are emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, unconditioned, {{page:{number:172,folio:F.87.a}}} unborn, and non-arising, they have the perfection of insight. When their minds are moved by great compassion, such that they avoid attaining the fruition and falling into the unconditioned, they have skill in means.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1764}} “Moreover, Sāgaramati, bodhisattvas do not perceive that there are discrete things that need doing for the sake of the sameness of the three times. The sameness of the realm of phenomena is equal to the realm of beings. The sameness of the realm of beings is equal to the realm of nirvāṇa. The sameness of the realm of nirvāṇa is equal to the realm of phenomena. Through entering the realm of phenomena they enter sameness. This is their perfection of insight. When they know the realm of beings to be one, without manifesting the realm of nirvāṇa, and when they do not lose sight of the realm of phenomena as they observe the realm of beings, that is their skill in means.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1765}} “Moreover, noble son, pure generosity is insight, and pure dedication is means. Pure discipline, patience, diligence, and concentration are insight, and their dedication is means. Basically, all their roots of virtue are insight, and dedication is means.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1766}} “Blessed One, what are bodhisattvas’ pure roots of virtue?” asked Sāgaramati. “What is pure dedication? What is pure insight? What is pure means?”
“Sāgaramati,” answered the Blessed One, “pure roots of virtue are roots of virtue that are gathered free from viewing in terms of a self, a being, a life principle, an individual, a human, or a person. Pure dedication is dedicating roots of virtue to awakening while experiencing emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. {{page:{number:173,folio:F.87.b}}} Pure insight is the wisdom that knows the faculties of beings, whether supreme or otherwise. Pure means is skill in teaching Dharma to beings according to what is appropriate for them individually.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1768}} “Moreover, Sāgaramati, pure roots of virtue are those roots of virtue that are gathered without being based in any birth that perpetuates existence. Pure dedication is to pursue all vehicles while being free from the mental engagement of hearers and solitary buddhas, and dedicate the roots of virtue to the Great Vehicle. Pure insight is to defeat the afflictions that manifest due to habitual tendencies. Pure means is to ripen beings and encourage them to uphold the Great Vehicle by showing a good example.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1769}} “Moreover, pure roots of virtue are like inexhaustible resources and jewels in one’s hand. Pure dedication is to remember and embrace the roots of virtue of all beings, practitioners, non-practitioners, solitary buddhas, bodhisattvas, and buddhas through dedication. Pure insight is to remember and retain that which is taught by the buddhas by sealing it with recollection. Pure means is to satisfy all beings with excellent speech consisting of unceasing eloquence, unobstructed eloquence, and meaningful Dharma teachings.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1770}} “Moreover, Sāgaramati, pure roots of virtue consist of not forgetting the mind of awakening throughout all one’s lifetimes. Pure dedication is dedicating all one’s roots of virtue, gathered without forgetting the mind of awakening, to omniscience. {{page:{number:174,folio:F.88.a}}} Pure insight is knowing groundless roots of virtue as the mind of awakening. Pure means is causing others to uphold the sameness of the mind of awakening in order to make others understand it.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1771}} Then, the bodhisattva Sāgaramati said to the Blessed One, “If I were to explain what I understood of what the Blessed One just expressed, then, Blessed One, I think that the awakening of those bodhisattvas who have pure skill in means and pure perfection of insight is comprehensive. Blessed One, for them there are no phenomena that are not awakening. Why is this? Blessed One, realizing all phenomena as sameness is awakening. Blessed One, for this reason bodhisattvas do not conceive of awakening as being something distant. Awakening is the accurate understanding of any phenomenon that appears among the six sense objects. Blessed One, bodhisattvas who confident in this way will attain pure skill in means and pure perfection of insight.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1772}} Then the Blessed One expressed his approval of Sāgaramati: “Excellent, Sāgaramati, excellent. It is like that. You have described it accurately. Awakening is the accurate understanding of any phenomenon that appears among the six sense objects to bodhisattvas who have pure skill in means and pure perfection of insight. Sāgaramati, that is how you should understand this teaching.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1773}} “Sāgaramati, countless, limitless, unfathomable, innumerable eons ago there was an eon called Star-Color. At that time, in a world called Emanation, the blessed buddha Infinite Light appeared.

Why was he called Infinite Light? Before that blessed one attained omniscience and was still a bodhisattva, he sat at the seat of awakening and light issued forth from his body. The light illuminated immeasurable, countless, and incalculable buddha realms throughout the ten directions with a brilliant glow. All the bodhisattvas who are irreversibly destined for awakening, as well as the bodhisattvas in their last lives, in those buddha realms beheld the bodhisattva seated at the seat of awakening and threw flowers in his direction. Through the power of the buddhas, when they threw those flowers, they landed on the bodhisattva’s body. The flowers formed a single pile of flowers the height of seven men in the world Emanation. The gods renowned for their power and the bodhisattvas in that world saw the light. Upon seeing this pure light, they exclaimed, ‘He will become the Thus-Gone Infinite Light!’ Thus this thus-gone one’s name became known as Infinite Light.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1774}} “Why was the world called Emanation? The wealth and enjoyments possessed by the people in this world were like those of the gods in the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations. Thus this world was called Emanation.

In each city were ten trillion people. In each village, market, and outlying settlement were eighty million people. There is of course no need to mention that they were powerful people. The world was formed of gold, silver, crystal, beryl, and four types of jewels. Food, drink, clothing, jewelry, and enjoyments were available at one’s wish. The gods and humans were free from grasping and had no thoughts of personal possession. The lifespan of the blessed thus-gone Infinite Light was ten intermediate eons. There were 300 trillion hearers in his great saṅgha of hearers. There were one billion and two hundred million bodhisattvas in his great assembly of bodhisattvas. {{page:{number:177,folio:F.89.b}}} The birthplace of the Blessed One was the royal palace known as Pure City.

His seven precious possessions were: the precious wheel, the precious elephant, the precious horse, the precious queen, the precious jewel, the precious steward, and the precious minister. King Pure Domain had set forth toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening. He was without aggression toward any being because of the abundance of his altruism. There were forty million women in King Pure Domain’s assembly of queens. Every single one of them had an excellent body; was gorgeous, beautiful, and looked like a goddess; and had also set forth toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening. The king had one thousand sons, each of whom was brave and courageous, had a fine body with excellent features, was capable of defeating his adversaries, had the strength of Nārāyaṇa, was adorned with the twenty-eight marks of a great individual, and had set forth toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening.

The offerings were of virtuous origin, fit for mendicants, and pleasing. {{page:{number:178,folio:F.90.a}}} As an act of veneration of the Blessed One, the king prepared a courtyard, which was vast and open, measured five hundred thousand leagues square, had a patio that was made of precious jewels and set with beryl, and was surrounded with a perimeter fence made of the seven precious substances. He prepared arrangements of red sandalwood and uraga sandalwood. It was beautiful and like a celestial palace. He also built millions of homes for the use of the monastic saṅgha.

Sāgaramati, they do so by appreciating how easy it is to say, ‘I am going to become a buddha,’ yet how hard it is to actually accomplish the virtues of the factors of awakening. Sāgaramati, any bodhisattva who regales beings with the gift of Dharma, announcing to them, ‘You will be satisfied by my gift of Dharma,’ and then teaches them extensively, but himself acts otherwise, failing to strive toward the virtues of the factors of awakening, has let those beings down.

Analogously, Sāgaramati, if a bodhisattva teaches extensively about finding relief in order to emancipate all beings who have not yet gone beyond, liberate those who have not yet been liberated, offer relief to those who have not found relief, and bring to parinirvāṇa those who have not yet reached parinirvāṇa, {{page:{number:188,folio:F.95.a}}} yet himself fails to strive toward the virtues of the factors of awakening, then that bodhisattva has not practiced what he preached. He has let the world and its gods down. If the gods who have previously beheld buddhas see him, they will deride, disparage, and belittle him. Those who pledge to perform offerings and actually go on to perform such offerings are rare. Still, compared to them, those who begin with the great offerings and remain undiscouraged by the unsurpassed Great Vehicle are even more rare.

They are patient sometimes but not on other occasions. They are patient with some but not with others. When they are patient, they get puffed up and arrogant, and when impatient, they do not swiftly confess it. That, Blessed One, is the third hook of Māra, related to a bodhisattva’s patience. {{page:{number:199,folio:F.100.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1863}} “Blessed One, for bodhisattvas engaged in diligence, there are some who, even though they are personally engaged in diligence, only ripen beings for the vehicles of the hearers and solitary buddhas but not for the Great Vehicle. They consistently tell stories about the hearers and solitary buddhas while withholding Great Vehicle stories. They endeavor in enjoying the world while failing to endeavor in the transcendental Dharma. Out of a sense of pleasure derived from venerating the thus-gone ones, they are assiduous in offering flowers, incense, garlands, perfume, lotions, powders, clothing, parasols, banners, and pennants, and show such inclinations, yet they fail to be diligent in the pursuit of study, in teaching what they have studied, in analyzing what they have studied, and in becoming learned. That, Blessed One, is the fourth hook of Māra, related to a bodhisattva’s diligence.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1864}} “Blessed One, for bodhisattvas who develop the four concentrations and develop and accomplish the four formless absorptions, there are some who remain long in those states. While remaining in such states of peaceful equipoise, they disparage the ripening of beings, the teaching of the Dharma, and associating with beings. They disparage the formations of merit and savor the taste of unwavering formations. They are happy in their preference for solitude and put forth very little effort. They do not seek to reverse the course of concentration. They perceive the desire and form realms as if they were death, and instead prefer to savor the taste of the formless realm. {{page:{number:200,folio:F.101.a}}} Looking down upon the body, they take birth in the formless realms, and arouse karmic fortune similar to the long-lived gods. Having been born there, they fail to please many buddhas, many hundreds of buddhas, many thousands of buddhas. They lack the opportunity to behold the Buddha, study the Dharma, and serve the Saṅgha. They fail to ripen beings, uphold the Dharma, and accumulate merit. Their faculties become dull and stupid, and after they die, wherever they are born, their minds are dense, gloomy, and sleepy. Blessed One, this is the fifth hook of Māra, related to a bodhisattva’s concentration.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1865}} “Blessed One, regarding bodhisattvas who have insight, there are some who know causes on account of seeing conditions. For them there are no causes, there is an absence of causes, and there are no conditioned things. They disparage the formations of merit and lack skillful means. They do not strive in the perfection of generosity, nor in the perfections of discipline, patience, diligence, or concentration. They think, ‘The perfection of insight is the best and most noble—the other perfections pale in comparison.’ They do not ripen their faculties, and fall into a state of indifference. They do not gather beings through the four means of attracting disciples. They are without enthusiasm and they savor the taste of the unconditioned. Blessed One, this is the sixth hook of Māra, related to a bodhisattva’s insight. {{page:{number:201,folio:F.101.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1866}} “Blessed One, regarding bodhisattvas who live in the wilderness, who enjoy living in remote places with contentment and few desires, there are some who stay in solitude and do not associate with householders or the ordained. They live happily with few pursuits and activities. Without moving, they do not seek learnedness, ripening beings, or studying the Dharma. They have no interest in offering Dharma discourses or advice. They are not of an inquisitive nature. They do not seek to understand what virtue is. They still their afflictions through living in the wilderness and with the joys of solitude. Thus they experience happiness by simply quelling upheavals, but they do not cultivate the path in order to truly defeat their latent potential. They do not strive in order to better either themselves or others. Blessed One, this is the seventh hook of Māra, related to a bodhisattva’s life in the wilderness.

They will teach the Dharma where there is food, a place to sleep, healing medicine, and supplies available—yet they will not teach the Dharma to those who have faith, inspiration, and the capacity and power to understand the well-spoken meaning, unless these students supply them with material goods. They will teach Dharma to those who give to them, even if they are vile, base, stupid, and unsuited to hear the vastness of Dharma. {{page:{number:202,folio:F.102.a}}} As they hanker after worldly wealth, they do not teach the Dharma to just anyone. Rather, they teach those who are not fitting vessels while disregarding those who should be taught. Blessed One, this is the eighth hook of Māra, related to a bodhisattva’s Dharma teachings.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1868}} “Blessed One, there are some bodhisattvas who take up the Lokāyata tradition. They will stop giving profound teachings to others and instead offer them various Lokāyata advice. As they do so, the world will be pleased with their Lokāyata advice. Being skilled in offering such advice, they delight others and receive their accolades. However, they will upset and sadden all otherwise cheerful bodhisattvas, as well as those gods who have beheld past buddhas, those who aspire toward the profound Dharma, and those who assemble to study the Dharma. Displeasing them, they will interrupt the continuity of profound advice to beings who enjoy worldly pleasures, and instead offer them a variety of Lokāyata teachings. Such noble sons cause the Dharma to end and do not uphold the sublime Dharma. Why is this? Because blessed buddhas manifest due to the profound meaning—not due to Lokāyata teachings.” He continued his address, “Blessed One, therefore bodhisattvas who conceal the profound teachings while giving Lokāyata teachings are acting in such a way that they will prevent the arising of buddhas. Blessed One, this is the ninth hook of Māra, related to a bodhisattva’s concealment of the profound teachings and pursuit of the Lokāyata tradition.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1869}} “Blessed One, {{page:{number:203,folio:F.102.b}}} there are some bodhisattvas who follow an unwholesome companion who pretends to be a spiritual friend. Following such a one, they will lose interest in the means of attracting disciples, ripening beings, upholding the sublime Dharma, and the accumulation of merit. They will train in solitude with few pursuits and voluntary poverty. They will attend to, follow, and serve those who usually teach the doctrines of the hearers and solitary buddhas rather than those of the Great Vehicle. When such bodhisattvas stay in solitude, they may give up the Great Vehicle. The bodhisattva may then think, ‘I should surely offer advice.’ Yet they proffer corrupt advice. When bodhisattvas proffer corrupt advice, they will advise others to live in solitude and adopt patience that makes use of signs and characteristics. They do not prescribe genuine and perfect bodhisattva work. What then is genuine and perfect bodhisattva work? Blessed One, genuine and perfect bodhisattva work consists of these ten things: (1) Basing oneself on the roots of faith and attending to, relying upon, and serving spiritual friends. (2) Seeking the virtuous Dharma as if one’s head and clothes were on fire. (3) Firm interest in the virtuous Dharma and not giving up right effort. (4) Acting carefully and not wasting what one does. (5) Seeking to constantly ripen beings without being attached to one’s own happiness. (6) Upholding the Dharma without consideration for life or limb. (7) Being insatiable in seeking out accumulations of merit in order to purify buddha realms {{page:{number:204,folio:F.103.a}}} and obtain the major and minor marks of excellence. (8) Seeking the accumulation of wisdom in order to attain recollection and eloquence. (9) Cultivating the perfection of insight so that one is not stained by the state of all ordinary beings. (10) Seeking skill in means so that one may transcend the deeds of hearers and solitary buddhas. Blessed One, these ten constitute genuine and perfect bodhisattva work. However, they will not teach these things that bodhisattvas are to train in. In this regard it is said that awakening is for bodhisattvas who strive with diligence, but not for the lazy. If after eight or ten eons one still has not fully awakened to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, one might think that one is unable to fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. However, Blessed One, if a bodhisattva is hoping to attain the fruition through procrastination, then this is the tenth hook of Māra, related to bodhisattvas pretending to be spiritual friends.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1870}} “Blessed One, moreover, bodhisattvas who are hardened and inflated by pride will, because of their pride, fail to bow before, prostrate to, or show respect to their masters, honorable ones, parents, teachers, preceptors, or other people in such positions. They will not care to stay near to, attend to, rely upon, serve, discuss with, or inquire of those who are learned in the practices of bodhisattvas, who have reached distinction, who have perfect recollection and eloquence, or who have perfected all bodhisattva deeds. {{page:{number:205,folio:F.103.b}}} As such, they will of course not hear the teachings that they do not listen to, but they will even be disinterested in those teachings that they do hear. In other ways as well, such people of the bodhisattva vehicle are caught by the hook of Māra. They are fond of those who engage in negative qualities and they even follow in their footsteps. They follow the lowly and lose any distinction. Thus they become weak, stupid, deaf, dumb, and inferior.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1871}} “Blessed One, to draw an analogy, if a person plants a magnolia tree in the vicinity of a riverbed, yet fails to channel water to it, the tree will wither among the pebbles and gravel in what otherwise would seem like a place with water. Blessed One, as the magnolia tree is lacking water, it will not grow branches, leaves, or twigs. The branches, leaves, and twigs will dry up and fall to the ground. Blessed One, likewise, bodhisattvas who have developed the mind of awakening but are hardened and inflated by pride will lack spiritual friends and opportunities to study the Dharma. They will of course not hear the teachings that they do not listen to, but they will even be disinterested in those teachings that they do hear.

Blessed One, therefore, if a bodhisattva who is hardened and inflated by pride cannot bow before, bend before, prostrate to, or show respect to their masters {{page:{number:206,folio:F.104.a}}} and honorable ones, then it should be known that they have been caught by the hook of Māra.

Such bodhisattvas could become arrogant and careless due to their good looks, wealth, servants, and power. When they see ordained bodhisattvas who have left the household life; who are diligent in the pursuit of the accumulation of wisdom; whose flesh and blood have withered due to heat and cold; who are emaciated, weak, and skinny; who practice diligently day and night as if their head and clothes were on fire; and who show constant exertion in the pursuit of virtuous qualities, they will think of them as thin, feeble, unattractive, and ugly beings who are worthy of contempt. They are not interested in receiving any advice from them, and they even consider them more lowly and deluded than themselves. Blessed One, this is the twelfth hook of Māra, related to a bodhisattva’s arrogance and carelessness.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1874}} “Blessed One, these twelve are Mara’s hooks reserved for bodhisattvas. If bodhisattvas do not escape them, they will not attain even acceptance conducive to awakening, so forget about fully awakening to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. {{page:{number:207,folio:F.104.b}}} It would be impossible. Therefore, Blessed One, it is by striving to fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood that a bodhisattva will escape these hooks of Māra.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1875}} The Blessed One then expressed his approval to the bodhisattva Sāgaramati: “Excellent, Sāgaramati, excellent. You have explained well these hooks of Māra reserved for bodhisattvas. Therefore, Sāgaramati, listen well and bear this in mind. I will explain to you the Dharma gateways through which bodhisattvas will always escape and destroy the hooks of Māra. Sāgaramati, what are the Dharma gateways that destroy the hooks of Māra? Sāgaramati, there are the following ten Dharma gateways that destroy the hooks of Māra.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1876}} “Sāgaramati, because all phenomena have the nature of emptiness, one can be absorbed in emptiness while still offering protection. So, to have great love for all beings is the first Dharma gateway that destroys the hooks of Māra.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1877}} “Sāgaramati, because all phenomena have the nature of signlessness, one can be absorbed in signlessness while bringing freedom. So, to have great compassion for all beings is the second Dharma gateway that destroys the hooks of Māra.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1878}} “Sāgaramati, because all phenomena have the nature of wishlessness, one can be absorbed in wishlessness while intentionally taking birth in order to ripen all beings. This is the third Dharma gateway that destroys the hooks of Māra.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1879}} “Sāgaramati, because all phenomena are naturally devoid of attachment, one can be absorbed in nonattachment while ripening beings who indulge in attachment. {{page:{number:208,folio:F.105.a}}} This is the fourth Dharma gateway that destroys the hooks of Māra.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1880}} “Sāgaramati, because all phenomena are naturally devoid of aggression, one can be absorbed in nonaggression while ripening beings who indulge in aggression. This is the fifth Dharma gateway that destroys the hooks of Māra.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1881}} “Sāgaramati, because all phenomena are naturally devoid of stupidity, one can be absorbed in non-stupidity while ripening beings who indulge in stupidity. This is the sixth Dharma gateway that destroys the hooks of Māra.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1882}} “Sāgaramati, because all phenomena are naturally free of being afflicted, one can be absorbed in not being afflicted while ripening beings who are afflicted. This is the seventh Dharma gateway that destroys the hooks of Māra.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1883}} “Sāgaramati, because all phenomena are naturally unborn and non-arising, one can be absorbed in the unborn and non-arising while teaching the Dharma to beings so they may discard birth, aging, sickness, and death. This is the eighth Dharma gateway that destroys the hooks of Māra.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1884}} “Sāgaramati, because all phenomena are by nature undifferentiated and of equal status, one can be absorbed in an undifferentiated state of equality while teaching the Dharma in order to establish all beings in the three vehicles, without giving up the Great Vehicle attitude. This is the ninth Dharma gateway that destroys the hooks of Māra.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1885}} “Sāgaramati, when a bodhisattva does not perpetuate mind, cognition, or consciousness; does not forget the mind of awakening; is free from all endeavors, yet does not give up the activity that frees beings; and transcends all activity without turning back from bodhisattva activity, this is the tenth Dharma gateway that destroys the hooks of Māra. {{page:{number:209,folio:F.105.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1886}} “Sāgaramati, these ten are the Dharma gateways that destroy the hooks of Māra. If bodhisattvas apply themselves to these, they will escape all of Māra’s hooks.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1887}} When this Dharma teaching that destroys the hooks of Māra was expressed, all the realms of Māra were eclipsed and shook in six ways. It was like how, when light streams forth from the ūrṇa hair of the Bodhisattva seated at the seat of awakening, all the realms of Māra are eclipsed. Analogously, at this time all the realms of Māra were eclipsed.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1888}} Then, when the evil Māra witnessed this spectacle, he quickly, swiftly, and without delay gathered the four divisions of his forces. Just as they gather in formation when they go near the Bodhisattva seated at the seat of awakening, the legions of Māra filled an area thirty-six leagues in diameter as they approached the assembly of the Blessed One. They were forced there by the power of the Buddha. However, even though they were actually there, they were invisible to anyone but the Thus-Gone One and the bodhisattvas who are irreversibly destined for awakening, as well as those worthy ones in the assembly who had tamed their minds, abandoned all ties to existence, and possessed the perfect view.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1889}} The Blessed One then asked the bodhisattva Sāgaramati, “Can you see the evil Māra and his display, Sāgaramati?”
“Blessed One, I see them.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1891}} “Sāgaramati,” asked the Blessed One, “what should be done now that the evil Māra has come here to obstruct this Dharma teaching?”
“Blessed One, he should be expelled to the world Adorned with Every Pleasure.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1893}} Then the venerable Śāradvatīputra asked the bodhisattva Sāgaramati, {{page:{number:210,folio:F.106.a}}} “Noble son, where is the world Adorned with Every Pleasure? What is the name of the thus-gone one who teaches the Dharma there?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1894}} “Venerable Śāradvatīputra,” replied Sāgaramati, “the world system Adorned with Every Pleasure is out beyond buddha realms numbering twelve times the grains of sand in the Ganges to the east of this buddha realm. There the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Mārapramardaka is teaching the Dharma. Why is this world system called Adorned with Every Pleasure? Venerable Śāradvatīputra, even given an eon, I could not fully express the pleasures, qualities, and manifestations in the world system Adorned with Every Pleasure. Therefore, that world system is called Adorned with Every Pleasure.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1895}} “When the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Mārapramardaka attained awakening, he was seated at the seat of awakening. Before he attained omniscience, light rays called ‘summoners of Māra’ issued forth from his body. Summoned by this light, every single one of the billions of māras in that universe and each of their ten-billionfold retinues came to the seat of awakening and set about trying to obstruct the bodhisattva. However, being unable to dissuade him, they were filled with shame and so touched the feet of that blessed one. As they gave rise to the mind set upon unsurpassed and perfect awakening from the bottom of their hearts, he then taught them the Dharma, after which he attained awakening. Thus, this thus-gone one is called Mārapramardaka. {{page:{number:211,folio:F.106.b}}} Moreover, in the supreme and excellent group that attained awakening were also bodhisattvas who had been converted from among the māras. Even those who served him were bodhisattvas who had been converted from among the māras. The blessed thus-gone Mārapramardaka solely taught the bodhisattva teachings. The name of any other vehicle was not even heard of. Venerable Śāradvatīputra, this is what the world Adorned with Every Pleasure is like. So, if they were sent there, these māras could no longer function.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1896}} The bodhisattvas who had been converted from among the māras simultaneously developed the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening and perfected the qualities directed toward awakening. The remaining evil māras became scared and their hair bristled. They wished to escape the gathering but could not. They could not disappear, and so their terror only increased. Touching the Blessed One’s feet, they pleaded, “Blessed One, please protect us so that the bodhisattva Sāgaramati does not send us to that world. Blissful One, please protect us!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1897}} “Evil ones,” said the Blessed One, “do not be afraid. These sublime beings are not out to harm others. Evil ones, beg the bodhisattva Sāgaramati to be patient with you and he will offer you protection.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1898}} The evil māras then joined their palms together and, prostrating to the bodhisattva Sāgaramati, pleaded, “Sublime being, please be patient with us. Please do not send us to the world Adorned with Every Pleasure. We will not even occasionally make obstacles for the assembly when a sublime being like yourself is teaching Dharma.” {{page:{number:212,folio:F.107.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1899}} “Evil ones,” responded Sāgaramati, “you do not need to ask me to be patient with the likes of you. Bodhisattvas are extremely patient with all beings. Evil ones, go to the world Adorned with Every Pleasure. See the appearances of that world and the blessed thus-gone Mārapramardaka for yourselves. No harm will come to you.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1900}} The bodhisattva Sāgaramati then extended his golden-colored right hand, placing it upon the heads of the evil ones. He blessed them with such words of truth: “Through the truths and words of truth that enable the bodhisattvas to not be stingy with the Dharma and teachers to not withhold the Dharma, may these evil māras come to possess the bases of miracles in the same way that I do.” As soon as the bodhisattva Sāgaramati pronounced this, the evil māras were endowed with the supreme strength of miracles. The worlds of this great trichiliocosm shook six times, and the evil māras disappeared from this buddha realm.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1901}} It was through the blessing of the bodhisattva Sāgaramati that they arrived at the world Adorned with Every Pleasure in that very same moment. The evil māras went before the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Mārapramardaka. They bowed their heads to the Blessed One, circumambulated him seven times, and sat to one side. When all the bodhisattvas who had been converted from among the māras in the buddha realm of the blessed thus-gone Mārapramardaka saw these evil ones, they asked {{page:{number:213,folio:F.107.b}}} the blessed thus-gone Mārapramardaka, “Blessed One, where have these pitiful, pallid, and ugly beings come from?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1902}} “Noble children,” answered the Blessed One, “beyond buddha realms numbering twelve times the grains of sand in the Ganges to the west of this buddha realm is the Sahā world. There is the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Śākyamuni. There he lives and remains. He gives Dharma teachings on the sections of The Great Compilation . He explains truly. Immeasurable, countless, and incalculable bodhisattvas from throughout the ten directions have gathered there to study this Dharma teaching. In that bodhisattva assembly is the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati, who wears the unfathomable armor. They are there to question that blessed one and to initiate questions. At the end of that Dharma teaching, these evil māras showed up to create confusion. These evil māras were tamed and overpowered by that sublime being and sent to this world.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1903}} The bodhisattvas who had been converted from among the māras then said to the evil māras, “We are also your friends. Evil ones, develop the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening! Why must you do this? We were also māras. Though we had set out to obstruct beings’ roots of virtue, because of the Thus-Gone One, we developed the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Therefore, you evil ones too: develop the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1904}} Then the evil māras developed the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening with an altruistic intention, proclaiming, {{page:{number:214,folio:F.108.a}}} “We give rise to the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening, and henceforth shall not engage in any actions of māras!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1905}} The bodhisattvas then placed the evil māras on a jeweled lion throne and implored them, “Noble sons, please elucidate a faithful recounting of the Dharma teachings on the sections of The Great Compilation .”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1906}} Then bodhisattva Sāgaramati offered his blessings such that the exact utterance of The Great Compilation spoken by the Blessed One Śākyamuni came from the mouths and pores of the māras on the jeweled lion throne. It was equal in letter, word, and syllable, without anything missing, anything extra, or anything left over. Then, when the bodhisattvas heard the teachings on the sections of The Great Compilation from the evil māras, they were amazed, and declared to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, we will visit the Sahā world, the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni, the bodhisattva Sāgaramati, and the bodhisattvas gathered from throughout the ten directions!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1907}} The blessed thus-gone Mārapramardaka then emitted light rays called “displaying all form” from his ūrṇa hair. The light rays passed through buddha realms numbering twelve times the grains of sand in the Ganges to bathe the Sahā world with a brilliant glow. The bodhisattvas now saw the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni seated on a lion throne, the praises of which could not be fully sung in a hundred eons, giving detailed Dharma teachings on the sections of The Great Compilation to the bodhisattvas who had gathered from throughout the ten directions in the jeweled courtyard. {{page:{number:215,folio:F.108.b}}} They also saw the bodhisattva Sāgaramati there. They also saw the Sahā world filled with water as if it were a single ocean. They saw all of this completely clearly. Further, they saw the bodhisattvas gathered from throughout the worlds of the directions arranged on jeweled lotuses, each a league in length, listening to the Dharma. Seeing this, they were satisfied, happy, joyful, and delighted. Being happy and pleased, they cast flowers toward the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni. Through the power of the Buddha, the flowers instantly formed into a great parasol over the crown of the Blessed One Śākyamuni’s head. The entire assembly was amazed when they saw this flower parasol. “Blessed One,” they asked, “where has the flower parasol made of these kinds of flowers come from?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1908}} “Friends,” the Blessed One answered, “these flowers have come from the world Adorned with Every Pleasure. The bodhisattvas there threw them as an act of venerating me.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1909}} “Blessed One, we want to see the world Adorned with Every Pleasure and what the blessed thus-gone Mārapramardaka and the evil māras are doing there.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1910}} Then, understanding the request made by the assembly, the Blessed One said to the bodhisattva Sāgaramati, “Noble son, show the world Adorned with Every Pleasure, the blessed thus-gone Mārapramardaka, and the evil māras to the assembly!” {{page:{number:216,folio:F.109.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1911}} Then, given the opportunity by the Blessed One, ten thousand light rays sprang from the bodhisattva Sāgaramati’s ten fingers, passing through buddha realms numbering twelve times the grains of sand in the Ganges to bathe the world Adorned with Every Pleasure with a brilliant glow. They beheld the entire assembly, the world Adorned with Every Pleasure, the blessed thus-gone Mārapramardaka, and the evil māras seated on the great Dharma throne, extensively giving Dharma teachings on the sections of The Great Compilation . Seeing this, they were astonished, and arose from their lotus seats to prostrate to the blessed thus-gone Mārapramardaka. They threw pearls and flowers toward the Blessed One and, immediately, through the power of the Buddha, the pearls and flowers appeared as a mansion of flowers at the crown of the Blessed One’s head.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1912}} The evil māras then declared to the blessed thus-gone Mārapramardaka, “Blessed One, we will go before the Blessed One Śākyamuni in the Sahā world.”
“Noble children,” answered the Blessed One, “if you know that the time has come, then go.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1914}} At that point the evil māras prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One and circumambulated him seven times, disappearing from that buddha realm. Through the blessings and miraculous power of the bodhisattva Sāgaramati, in that very same moment, they arrived in this Sahā world. They went before the Blessed One and bowed their heads to his feet. {{page:{number:217,folio:F.109.b}}} Then they circumambulated him seven times, prostrated to him, and took their seat off to one side.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1915}} Venerable Śāradvatīputra then asked the evil māras, “Friends, did you see the world Adorned with Every Pleasure?”
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, we saw that world in all its purity. That realm of bodhisattvas—the most supreme of pure and immaculate beings—is astounding. Seeing it, we also developed the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1917}} “Friends, having developed the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening, do you plan any māra activity?”
“Venerable Śāradvatīputra, we cannot perform any māra activity against bodhisattvas who have developed pure motivation. Why is this? To the degree that we perform māra activity, the bodhisattvas get stronger and more diligent. Venerable Śāradvatīputra, from this point, you should understand that when māra activity is aimed at bodhisattvas, that very activity is said to be buddha activity. It is not māra activity.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1919}} Once the revelations of the buddha realm and the miracle that happened to the māras were recounted, twenty thousand beings in the assembly developed the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Ten thousand māras in the māra assembly also developed the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening, and proclaimed with one voice, “Blessed One, may we be born in the world Adorned with Every Pleasure!” The Blessed One then prophesied their birth in that buddha realm. {{page:{number:218,folio:F.110.a}}}
Chapter Twelve: Blessings
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1921}} The bodhisattva Sāgaramati then requested the Blessed One, “Blessed One, given that the awakening of the thus-gone ones encounters many obstacles and much opposition, please carefully grant your blessings, Blessed One, such that through the blessings of the Thus-Gone One, these sūtras will not fade, but grow; that they will be upheld and read; that their teachers will not have to vie with māras and gods of the class of māras; that this sublime Dharma may long remain; and that these sūtras will be preserved, kept safe, and accepted.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1922}} The Blessed One said to the bodhisattva Sāgaramati, “Any being who retains such a sūtra as this, Sāgaramati, and teaches it, accepts it, and practices it diligently and develops roots of virtue, will hold the power of discipline and the blessings of this Dharma teaching. Therefore, Sāgaramati, listen well and bear what I say in mind: these words will summon the Four Great Kings. So that this Dharma teaching is protected and so those who teach it are accepted, these words that summon the Four Great Kings who work in earnest must be spoken. Sāgaramati, what are the summoning words? They are:
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-2170}} samesama­sandhi sarane sarapati dhane dhanavati dhudhume dhudhumati āvarte amale vimale viraje kakare kāruṇe huhu huhuvati huhusandhi nirghatani avatte vīvatte madhu­mati­marajite viśuddhe viśudhavati misile manorahare. {{note:{index:26,id:UT22084-058-001-1923}}}
Sāgaramati, these are the summoning words. They should be used in earnest, so the Four Great Kings are summoned {{page:{number:219,folio:F.110.b}}} and this Dharma teaching is protected and its teachers accepted.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1924}} “When Dharma teachers chant this mantra while spreading love throughout the four directions and bringing the Four Great Kings to mind, the Four Great Kings will be summoned by the mantra.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1925}} Then the Four Great Kings, who were present in the assembly, rose from their seats. They joined their hands in the direction of the Blessed One and bowed to him, saying, “Blessed One, we, the Four Great Kings, will collectively protect this Dharma teaching and care for its teachers, wherever it is taught with a proper mind, such that they are not obstructed or harmed in any way.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1926}} The Blessed One said, “Moreover, Sāgaramati, the words that summon Śakra, lord of the gods, must be spoken. These words will summon Śakra, lord of the gods. What are the words that summon Śakra, lord of the gods? They are:
jaye jayamati attemattemaṃ­kure siddhamati śubheśānti­kare nadane dānte dāntamati tadkare kṣaye kṣaya­mukhe avttani­vivattanivari­pattani paricchede smṛtismṛti­sandhi āgaccha­kauśika nirjitā asura jayanti­deva samayaste aravadho dharmanijito ramahi svāsti­yanāma­bhutānāṃ arakṣa­dharmacāriṇāṃ.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-2171}} Sāgaramati, these are the words that summon Śakra, lord of the gods. They will summon Śakra, lord of the gods.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1927}} “Dharma teachers should chant these mantra syllables and then wash themselves with the cleansing and purifying ritual, wear fine clothes, toss flowers to the east, recollect all the buddhas, have great compassion for all beings, {{page:{number:220,folio:F.111.a}}} and then take their seat on a lion throne. Then, considering Śakra, lord of the gods, they should say, ‘Kauśika, please come and strengthen the assembly. Enact the fruition of this mantra.’ When they do so, because of the purity of their intention and the purity of their discipline, immediately Śakra will come and enter the assembly and enact the fruition of the mantra.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1928}} Then Śakra, lord of the gods, who was present in the assembly, pledged to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, I will be present near Dharma teachers in order to uphold and preserve this Dharma teaching. I will strengthen their assembly. I will enact the fruition of this mantra. Blessed One, I will extensively and faithfully relay this Dharma teaching to the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. Why will I do this? Because it demonstrates the bodhisattva deeds of the blessed buddhas of the past, present, and future. Blessed One, I will honor the Dharma of the blessed buddhas of the past, present, and future; thus, I will teach this Dharma teaching extensively and faithfully.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1929}} Then the Blessed One offered his approval to Śakra, lord of the gods: “Kauśika, excellent! It is excellent that you utter the lion’s roar in order to uphold the sublime Dharma. That is your task. Lord of the gods, if you contemplate this Dharma teaching, know that the gods will be victorious, and the asuras will be defeated.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1930}} “Moreover, Sāgaramati, the following mantra that destroys the māras and gods of the class of māras {{page:{number:221,folio:F.111.b}}} must be chanted. Thereby, this mantra will destroy the māras and gods of the class of māras. What is this mantra? It is:
śame śamavati śamitaśatru oṃkure maṃkure mārajite karāṭe keyūre tejovati ohokamati viśaṭha nirmale malāvanaye okhare okharā grase khayāgrase grasate hemukhī parāmukhi amukhī śamitāni sarva­graha­vandhanāni nigraṃhitā sarva­parapravādina vimuktā­māra­pāśā sthāpitā­buddha­mudrā samud­ghatitāh sarva­mārā sucarita­pada­pariśuddhya gacchantu­sarva­māra­karmaṇi.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1931}} “Sāgaramati, these syllables destroy māras and eliminate afflictions. Dharma teachers should chant these syllables while seated on a Dharma throne, pervading the entire assembly with a love that is formed by awakening, and while arousing the notion of themselves as physicians, the Dharma as medicine, the Dharma audience as patients, the Thus-Gone One as a sublime being, and the way of the Dharma as something that persists. When they bring forth this mantra and teach the Dharma, no māra or god of the class of māra will be able to come within a hundred leagues to cause confusion. Even if they do come near, they will be unable to cause obstacles.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1932}} The evil māras then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, when the bodhisattva Sāgaramati sent us to the world Adorned with Every Pleasure, the sublime beings there manifested their blessings, magic, and miracles for us. {{page:{number:222,folio:F.112.a}}} Blessed One, from this day hence we will spurn all the works of Māra. We will be present wherever this Dharma teaching is given—in any town, village, city, or temple where it is taught. We will be humble, respectful, and deferential to receive it.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1933}} The Blessed One said, “Excellent, excellent, evil ones. As this respect for the Dharma ripens, you will gradually give up all the works of Māra. You will attain the same Dharma that these sublime beings attain.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1934}} “Moreover, Sāgaramati, the mantra that summons Brahmā, master of the Sahā world, must be spoken. Once Brahmā has been summoned with this summoning mantra, he will come before Dharma teachers. What is this mantra? It is:
maitrekare karuṇakare mudita­kare upekṣa­kare buddhakare dharma­kare saṅgha­kare sukrītavijaye mahāvitāne nisphare dāghe ojovati ojogame dharmāna nadane satya­pratiṣṭāne upapati viśuddhe svacitta upaśame vyavalokaya­brahmāṇa vyutiṣṭha­namaste apekṣa svadharma­caraṇāṃ kurusa­dharma­parigrāhaṇa kritamanu­vālaya buddhane trīmama­vyavacche vasi smarata dharma­cakra­pravartānāṃ kurusatva­viśodhanā pratigrīhāna dharmā­nāgaramālānāṃ māvikaupaya.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1935}} “Sāgaramati, Dharma teachers should chant these words that summon Brahmā, master of the Sahā world, live a pure life, and have non-aggressive minds, calm faculties, guarded mindfulness, a pure seal, {{page:{number:223,folio:F.112.b}}} pure physical actions, isolated verbal actions, stable minds, good patient deeds, refined discipline, well-applied diligence, reliable learning, cultivated mental pliancy, sharp faculties of insight, and diligent proper engagement. They should retain the mind of awakening, have fully cultivated love, arouse joy in all beings through their stable great compassion, sit on the lion throne in order to liberate all beings from suffering, and deliver Dharma discourses while remembering Brahmā, master of the Sahā world. Then, as soon as they bring him to mind, Brahmā and his Brahmā gods will arrive.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1936}} “Sāgaramati, the following things will happen when Brahmā is seen arriving: the entire assembly will change to having a loving mind, their faculties will not decline, they will not harm one another, they will esteem the Dharma and Dharma teachers as teachers and masters, they will join their palms, their minds will be one-pointed, they will be mentally engaged without distraction, they will act with perseverance, they will be mentally engaged, and with their whole minds they will be conscientious and attentively listening. These Dharma teachers will attain the scriptures they had not previously received and the teachings they had not previously heard. Know that it is into their assembly that Brahmā, master of the Sahā world, will come.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1937}} Then Brahmā, master of the Sahā world, who was present there, said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, I live in the Brahmā world. However, I will give up its concentrations and limitless bliss states to be present in the assemblies where this Dharma teaching is given. {{page:{number:224,folio:F.113.a}}} Such Dharma teachers will accomplish eight qualities. What are they? (1) They will accomplish mindfulness in order to not forget the teachings they have heard. (2) They will accomplish intelligence in order to realize the profound Dharma. (3) They will accomplish realization in order to fully comprehend the meaning. (4) They will accomplish eloquence in order to cut through all doubt. (5) They will accomplish perfect teachings in order to satisfy with all manner of languages and explanations. (6) They will accomplish the guarding of the vinaya in order to outshine the entire assembly. (7) They will accomplish the light of Dharma in order to teach inferior beings. (8) They will accomplish the gateway of emancipation in order to engage in all of this and to accomplish the Dharma. Blessed One, such Dharma teachers will accomplish these eight qualities. So that these Dharma teachers may be guarded and protected, and so that the sublime Dharma may remain for a long time, through the blessings of the Thus-Gone One, I will ensure that as this Dharma teaching is spread, all māras and obstructers will be destroyed.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1938}} The bodhisattva Sāgaramati then requested the Blessed One, “Blessed One, please grant your blessings so that in the final age after the Thus-gone One has passed into complete nirvāṇa, this Dharma teaching will reach the hands of beings who have formed roots of virtue, be placed in treasuries, put into writing, and not fade.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1939}} The Blessed One understood the bodhisattva Sāgaramati’s request and sent forth a burst of light from his ūrṇa hair that filled the worlds of the great trichiliocosm with a brilliant glow. This caused all the grasses, trees, herbs, {{page:{number:225,folio:F.113.b}}} forests, stones, pebbles, and everything else in the worlds of the great trichiliocosm to appear in the form of the Thus-Gone One. In the jeweled pavilion, all the appearances that had been blessed as offerings also appeared in the form of the Thus-Gone One.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1940}} All these forms of the Thus-Gone One then proclaimed in unity, “Hark! This Dharma teaching is blessed by the blessed Śākyamuni. Anything that is blessed by a blessed one is blessed by all blessed ones. Anything that is blessed by all blessed ones cannot be obstructed by māras. Even if māras, their supporters, and their servants as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges were to try to obstruct it, they could not obstruct this Dharma teaching. Why is this? It is possible that the earth could crack open, that the oceans could evaporate, that the mountains could crumble, that the wind could be captured, that the sun and moon could plummet to the earth, that space could show itself as form, that fire could become water, that water could become fire, that the four elements could transform into other elements, that the minds of all beings could function as one, and that the earth and sky could get stuck together—yet, it is impossible that the blessings of the thus-gone ones could be agitated, shaken, or disturbed by anyone.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1941}} Then the Blessed One placed his hand upon Venerable Ānanda’s crown, saying to him, “Ānanda, you must uphold the sacred Dharma to ensure it will last a long time. You must uphold this Dharma teaching and keep it, recite it, master it, and teach it broadly and genuinely to others!” {{page:{number:226,folio:F.114.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1942}} Then the bodhisattva Sāgaramati asked the Blessed One, “When there are bodhisattvas here who have attained the mindfulness and intellect of the truth seen by the Blessed One, which is as difficult to fathom as the ocean or a great sea, why is the monk Ānanda, with his partial understanding, to be entrusted with this Dharma teaching?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1943}} “Sāgaramati,” responded the Blessed One, “the monk Ānanda will not uphold this sūtra by arousing his own strength of intellect. He will uphold it through the Thus-Gone One’s blessings. Sāgaramati, any being who hears this Dharma teaching from the monk Ānanda will be gladdened, and attain faith and supreme joy. It will occur to them, ‘It is through the Thus-Gone One’s blessings that this hearer is upholding and teaching this sūtra; such are the unfathomable and incredible blessings of the Thus-Gone One.’ ”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1944}} Then some of the gods and men in the assembly thought, “How is it that the bodhisattva Sāgaramati is endowed with this degree of mindfulness while Venerable Ānanda, who is the most knowledgeable of all those taught by the Thus-Gone One, is not?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1945}} Venerable Mahākāśyapa knew the thoughts of the assembly with his own mind. So, while casting his gaze over the assembly, he asked the Blessed One, “The bodhisattva Sāgaramati is endowed with perfect mindfulness. Is Venerable Ānanda not also? He is the most knowledgeable of all the learned taught by the Thus-Gone One.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1946}} “Kāśyapa,” answered the Blessed One, “what do you think about the claim that the dispositions of beings contained within buddha realms as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Ganges are myriad—more so than the elements of earth. Kāśyapa, are the dispositions of beings myriad?” {{page:{number:227,folio:F.114.b}}}
“Blessed One, they are myriad. Blissful One, they are limitless,” said Kāśyapa.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1948}} “Kāśyapa,” the Blessed One continued, “imagine that all those beings attained a human body all at once and that each of them possessed all the power of mindfulness and recollection that the monk Ānanda possesses. Even then, they still would not equal even a fraction of the power of mindfulness and recollection produced by the bodhisattva Sāgaramati. No analogy could ever describe it. Kāśyapa, the bodhisattva Sāgaramati retains the teachings of all the blessed buddhas of the ten directions. When one thus-gone one teaches the Dharma, it does not lessen or increase the Dharma teaching of a second thus-gone one. Kāśyapa, I will draw an analogy: A rain the depth of a chariot axle could fall upon the great ocean, but one body of water will not lessen or increase a second body of water. Even though the ocean absorbs all the flow of all rivers, it does not grow or shrink. Kāśyapa, likewise, though the bodhisattva Sāgaramati retains the Dharma teaching of all the blessed buddhas, the Dharma teaching of one thus-gone one does not lessen or increase the Dharma teaching of a second thus-gone one. There is no increase or decrease to the strength of recollection he has aroused.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1949}} When this teaching was given, eight thousand beings developed the mind directed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening, and proclaimed, “May we develop the strength of recollection to the same degree as the bodhisattva Sāgaramati!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1950}} The entire assembly then tossed earthly and divine flowers toward the Blessed One and the bodhisattva Sāgaramati. {{page:{number:228,folio:F.115.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1951}} The bodhisattva Padmavyūha then asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, how much merit will a noble son or daughter develop when they hear this Dharma gateway and trust it, or when they retain it, keep it, read it, recite it, understand it, or apply it earnestly?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1952}} The Blessed One then spoke these verses in response to the bodhisattva Padmavyūha:
“The merit of filling the worlds of the great trichiliocosm With gold and offering it to the blissful ones, Is exceeded by anyone who hears this Dharma treasure And is inspired by it.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1957}} “The merit generated by engaging with this sūtra Could not be generated by Someone filling ten thousand worlds with jewels And offering them to the thus-gone ones.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1961}} “Not even a fraction of the merit created by Someone reciting and teaching this sūtra Is present in filling ten thousand worlds With jewels and giving them away.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1965}} “Filling hundreds of billions of realms With jewels and offering them to the buddhas— The teachers and protectors of the world— Does not equal someone applying themselves to this teaching.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1969}} “The merit of applying this teaching cannot be equaled By filling worlds as numerous as the grains of sand In all the Ganges Rivers throughout the ten directions With jewels and offering them to the victors.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1973}} “Perfecting the mind of awakening, upholding the Dharma, Practicing the Dharma, and having compassion for beings— These four qualities bring infinite merit. The Blissful One cannot describe their limit.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1977}} “The domain of space, the dispositions of beings, Buddhas’ wisdom, and the mind of awakening— These four things are unfathomable. The learned ones should not doubt this in their studies.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1981}} “When this Dharma jewel is taught, A billion realms in the ten directions will shake. They will be illuminated and flowers will rain down. Thousands of cymbals will resound without being played.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1985}} “All learned bodhisattvas will rejoice And marvel to one another, ‘In hearing this teaching, we have discovered A truly meaningful way to live!’ {{page:{number:229,folio:F.115.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-1989}} “Any being that hears this Will have discovered something great. Anyone who does not forget the mind of awakening Will be held dear by the thus-gone ones.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-2167}} Billions of buddhas from the ten directions Extended their right hands and, Placing them upon the crown of the one with ocean-like qualities, They spoke an encouragement of the Lion of the Śākyas.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-2168}} Gods, nāgas, asuras, kinnaras, Gandharvas, yakṣas, garuḍas, mahoragas, Brahmā, Śakra, and the world protectors Exclaimed in amazement while floating in the sky,
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-2001}} “May the Lion of the Śākyas and the Saṅgha, And those who uphold a sūtra like this, And the heroic bodhisattvas live long! And may this well-spoken Dharma never fade!
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-2005}} “We will serve anyone Who upholds this Dharma way. We will respectfully protect them, And carefully delight them.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-2009}} Then the Blessed One said to the bodhisattva Sāgaramati, “Sāgaramati, this Dharma way, this Dharma seal, this Dharma compilation, this Dharma division has been explained, is being explained, and will be explained by all the blessed buddhas of the past, present, and future. Sāgaramati, with respect and reverence, you must fully accomplish it.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-001-2010}} Once the Blessed One had spoken, the bodhisattva great being Sāgaramati, the entire bodhisattva assembly, the saṅgha of monks, and the world of gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas all rejoiced and praised what the Blessed One had taught.
