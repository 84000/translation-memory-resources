The Tantra of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-25}} {{page:{number:1,folio:F.304.b}}} Oṁ , homage to Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa!
Thus have I heard at one time. Lord Vajrasattva dwelt within the bhaga of the goddess of the Vajra Realm , which is the essence of body, speech, and mind of all tathāgatas. He dwelt there together with many hosts of vajra yogins and yoginīs, namely: White Acala vajra yogin, Yellow Acala vajra yogin, Red Acala vajra yogin, Green Acala vajra yogin, Delusion Vajrī vajra yoginī, Calumny Vajrī vajra yoginī, Passion Vajrī vajra yoginī, and Envy Vajrī vajra yoginī. He dwelt there with trillions of yogins and yoginīs, headed by those just mentioned.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-26}} Then Lord Vajrasattva, having entered the absorption of Black Acala, spoke:
“Freed from existence and nonexistence, Solely devoted to the four joys, I am naturally without mental elaboration And devoid of all mental constructs.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-27}} “I am endowed with five forms In order to benefit the fools Who don’t know me as present In the body of every man.”
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-28}} Then the blessed goddess of the Vajra Realm , having entered the absorption of Hatred Vajrī, said this:
“Inseparable from emptiness and compassion, Abiding in pleasure with divine lust, Devoid of all mental constructs am I, Free from mental elaboration and undistracted.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-29}} “I am endowed with five forms In order to benefit those women Who don’t know me as present In the body of every woman.”
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-30}} The lord Black Acala deeply kissed and firmly embraced Hatred Vajrī, {{page:{number:2,folio:F.305.a}}} and said:
“Goddess, goddess! Very enjoyable, Secret and extremely hard to come by, More essential than the essence, supreme, Beautifully taught by all the buddhas—
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-31}} “Hear it: I will teach this great tantra, The lord of kings of tantras, the supreme, Called Sole Hero, For beings’ swift accomplishment.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-32}} “This tantra must not be revealed To one who has not seen its maṇḍala. Nor should one explain this king of tantras To someone who has entered a different maṇḍala.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-33}} “To the one who has entered the maṇḍala of Caṇḍaroṣa, Who is abiding in absorption, Who possesses supreme faith and diligence, O fierce goddess, To him one should explain this tantra.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-34}} “To the one who is devoted to the teacher, compassionate, Wholly engaged in the Mantrayāna, And always devoted to Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, To him should one explain this tantra.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-35}} “However, should any yogin, Despite knowing this, corrupted by greed, Explain the supreme tantra of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa To someone who has not seen his maṇḍala,
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-36}} “He will be seized by severe illnesses, Soiled by stool and urine, And experience the suffering of death Within six months.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-37}} “Then, seized by the messengers of Yama, Overpowered by the noose of Time, To hell will he, the evil one, be led, Even if he is protected by buddhas.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-38}} “If, after the exhaustion of his karma, Having experienced suffering for a hundred thousand years, He attains a human birth, He will be destroyed in that birth by a bolt of lightning.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-39}} “So therefore, a lay vow-holder who knows the path of mantras Should draw a beautiful maṇḍala. He should cause the disciples— Only those previously examined—to enter there,
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-40}} “And should then explain this tantra, Difficult to find in the three worlds. Anyone who would explain it to one who hasn’t studied Will follow a downward course.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-41}} “He will suffer inflammation of the mouth, Even though he may be equal to buddhas. Or else, if a disciple without faith Listens to the explanation out of a mere desire to know,
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-42}} “His head will be split by a thunderbolt, Without any doubt, during the rainy season. This truth, O goddess, I have taught, O beautiful-faced one,
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-43}} “In this, the well-guarded Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called The Sole Hero .” {{page:{number:3,folio:F.305.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-44}} This concludes the first chapter, the introduction to the tantra, in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called “ The Sole Hero .”
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-45}} Then the blessed Hatred Vajrī tightly embraced Lord Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa and said:
“What is the size of the maṇḍala, And with what materials should it be drawn? And also, what is to be written in its center? Tell me, O lord!”
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-46}} The lord then said:
“The size of the maṇḍala Should be one cubit, two cubits, Three cubits, four or five— But not more than five cubits in measure.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-47}} “It should be made with powders of whatever substances And of different colors, With four corners, four doors, And adorned with four archways.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-48}} “One should draw the door the size of One-eighth of the whole maṇḍala, The portico the same size as the door, And the cupola one-half of that.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-49}} “And also, of such measure, the side, the altar, The garland, the half-garland, and the paṭṭikā. The rajobhuva , however, outside of the base line, Should be one-half of the paṭṭikā.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-50}} “One should draw the row of vajras of the same size And also the eight pillars. One should make the chief gateway Three times as big as the door.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-51}} “A double vajra should be drawn below, Surrounded by the vajra-enclosure. The maṇḍala of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa Should be adorned with wish-fulfilling trees, and so on.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-52}} “One should also demarcate an inner enclosure In the round shape of a circle. In its eight directions, starting from the east, One should draw a multicolored lotus of eight petals,
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-53}} “With the space in the middle being the ninth. In the center of the ninth, a deep-blue sword should be drawn Marked with a vajra and placed together with A vajra-knife and a skull cup.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-54}} “In the east, one should draw A sword of white color marked with a wheel. In the south, one should draw A yellow sword, inlaid with a jewel.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-55}} “In the west, one of red color, Marked with a red lotus. In the north, one should draw A plain sword of dark-green color.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-56}} “In the southeast corner, one should draw A white knife, marked with a wheel. In the southwestern corner, one should draw A yellow one, nicely marked with a jewel. {{page:{number:4,folio:F.306.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-57}} “In the northwestern corner, similarly, A red one, nicely marked with a red lotus, should be drawn. In the northeastern corner, A dark-green one with a blue lotus.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-58}} “One should arrange all these signs In position above the sun and the moon. I have taught this maṇḍala of powders To accomplish the benefit of the world.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-59}} “Alternatively one should prepare a maṇḍala In the form of a canvas-picture, nicely painted. The maṇḍala should be drawn as before. In the center, one should draw Black Acala,
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-60}} “Embraced by Hatred Vajrī. In the east, one should draw White Acala; Similarly Yellow Acala in the south. In the west, one should draw Red Acala;
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-61}} “In the north, one should draw Green Acala. In the southeast, white Delusion Vajrī; In the southwest, one should draw Yellow Calumny Vajrī.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-62}} “In the northwest, one should draw The red goddess Passion Vajrī; In the northeast, draw dark-green Envy Vajrī. So one should draw the canvas-maṇḍala.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-63}} “Now comes the maṇḍala tutelage mantra:
“ Oṁ , Blessed Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, together with your retinue, come, come! Jaḥ hūṁ vaṁ hoḥ ! Assume tutelage over this maṇḍala! Hūṁ phaṭ! Svāhā! {{note:{index:13,id:UT22084-080-015-2154}}}
“With this mantra, one should summon, induct, bind, and enthrall Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, and then worship him.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-64}} “Now comes the worship mantra:
“ Oṁ , Black Acala, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ! {{note:{index:14,id:UT22084-080-015-2155}}} Oṁ , White Acala, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ! Oṁ , Yellow Acala, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ! Oṁ , Red Acala, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ! Oṁ , Green Acala, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ!
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-65}} “ Oṁ , Hatred Vajrī, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ! {{note:{index:15,id:UT22084-080-015-2156}}} Oṁ , Delusion Vajrī, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ! Oṁ , Calumny Vajrī, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ! Oṁ , Passion Vajrī, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ! Oṁ , Envy Vajrī, accept this flower! Hūṁ phaṭ!
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-66}} “The flowers, and likewise the light, the incense, The perfumes, and the food— With these five offerings, One should worship the maṇḍala.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-67}} “When, however, White Acala is in the center, Together with Delusion Vajrī, The maṇḍala should be known as his. So would be the case with Yellow Acala and so forth.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-68}} “One should prepare the five maṇḍalas According to the division of the five yogins, With one-pointed mind, Having made an effort to do the prior worship first.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-69}} “Only after offerings to the maṇḍala have been made, {{page:{number:5,folio:F.306.b}}} Can one offer refreshments of wine and meat To the yoginī embraced by the yogin And praise her again and again.”
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-70}} This concludes the chapter on the maṇḍala, the second in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called “ The Sole Hero .”
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-71}} Then the goddess said:
“How should the student be prepared, And how should he be engaged in this tantra? How are his doubts resolved? Please explain this, O great lord!”
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-72}} The lord then said:
“First one should give him the triple refuge, The five disciplines, and the fast. Then the five empowerments, The secret empowerment, and lastly the wisdom-consort empowerment.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-73}} “Then the disciple will be fit. One should explain this tantra to him alone; One should keep others far away, Otherwise one will go to Raurava Hell.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-74}} “This is the verse of the triple refuge:
“I go to the Buddha, my refuge, Until I attain the essence of awakening. I go to the Dharma, my refuge, And to the Saṅgha, with undivided faith.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-75}} “This is the verse of the five disciplines:
“Killing and also stealing, Seducing another’s wife, false speech— I abandon all of that like a snake. Also the fifth, the intoxicants.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-76}} “This is the verse of the observance of the fast:
“I will not kill living beings, Nor steal another’s property. I will practice celibacy And avoid false words.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-77}} “I will never drink wine— The cause of intoxication— And will avoid dance, song, And ornaments, along with merriment, {{note:{index:16,id:UT22084-080-015-2157}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-78}} “High bed, grand bed, And also eating at inappropriate times. In this way, I will keep pure The eightfold vow of the fast,
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-79}} “In agreement with the instructions for the arhats, Just as instructed by the Buddha. When I have conquered the wicked Māra in this way And attained the ultimate buddhahood,
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-80}} “I shall become a refuge for all beings Suffering in saṃsāra. {{note:{index:17,id:UT22084-080-015-2158}}} For as long as I circle in saṃsāra, For so long, I, a male offspring of the buddhas, {{page:{number:6,folio:F.307.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-81}} “Shall be one who associates with good people, Is wise, and delights in the good of the world.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-82}} “This is the water empowerment:
“Visualizing the disciple to be pure and spotless like a crystal, one should draw some water from the victory jar with a mango blossom and sprinkle the disciple with it, with the words ‘ Oṁ āḥ , for the one possessed of the glory of the pledge of the empowerment of all the tathāgatas, hūṁ. ’ {{note:{index:18,id:UT22084-080-015-2159}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-83}} “This is the crown empowerment:
“One should first fashion a cloth crown that resembles a crown with many gems. Then one should visualize the disciple as a universal emperor, place the crown on his head, and sprinkle him as before. The mantra is ‘ Oṁ , Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, enter, enter into his heart! Hūṁ phaṭ! ’ {{note:{index:19,id:UT22084-080-015-2160}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-84}} “This is the sword empowerment:

In this way, the name empowerment of the five Acalas, according to the color division of black and so forth, should be given to the sādhaka. This is the fivefold empowerment.

To them, however, in place of the wisdom empowerment , the skillful means empowerment should be given.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-88}} “Now comes the secret empowerment.
“The disciple should first offer clothes and so forth to the teacher before presenting him with a girl who is young and beautiful and dear to his heart.
“ ‘This girl that I offer you Grants all the pleasures of love; Accept her for the sake of your pleasure. Please have compassion, O lord.’
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-89}} “The disciple should then bow to the teacher, leave the room, and recite the mantra, ‘ Oṁ , Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa, hūṁ phaṭ! ’
“The teacher should make offerings to himself with wine, meat, and so forth, and then satiate the wisdom consort. He should unite with her and place the semen and blood obtained from this in the fold of a leaf or such. He should then summon the disciple. Using his ring finger and thumb, the teacher should take the substance and use it to write the syllables hūṁ and phaṭ on the disciple’s tongue. He should then ask the disciple to recite, ‘ Ah, pleasure. ’ {{note:{index:29,id:UT22084-080-015-2170}}}
“Then the teacher should say, ‘Today I will cause the buddha-knowledge to arise, through which lord buddhas of the past, future, and present attain nonabiding nirvāṇa. But you must not speak of this in front of anyone who has not seen the maṇḍala. If you do speak of it, then…’
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-90}} “Placing the sword against the disciple’s heart, the teacher should continue as follows:
“ ‘This sword, which is in Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa’s hand, Is very sharp indeed. Whoever breaches the samaya, This sword is dedicated to cutting him up. {{page:{number:8,folio:F.308.a}}}

{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-93}} “The teacher should fasten a blindfold across the disciple’s eyes and invite him to throw a flower onto the maṇḍala. As the teacher removes the blindfold, he should then point out the maṇḍala to the disciple and explain its symbolism. Then he should offer the same wisdom consort to the disciple, saying:
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-94}} “ ‘She is your delightful supporter; She is to be served as taught by the buddhas. A fool who transgresses against this Will not attain the highest accomplishment.’
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-95}} “Next the teacher should whisper into the disciple’s ear about the division of the four joys. Then the teacher should go out. The wisdom consort should undress and, lying on her back, point to her secret place, saying:
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-96}} “ ‘My dear, are you eager To eat my impurities, Even if they were feces, urine, and blood, And suck the interior of my bhaga?’
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-97}} “The sādhaka should say:
“ ‘Why wouldn’t I be eager, O mother, To eat your impurities? I should practice devotion to women Until I attain the essence of awakening.’
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-98}} “And she should say:
“ ‘Ah, whoever serves, According to procedure, this lotus of mine, Which is endowed with every pleasure, To him I will grant accomplishment.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-99}} “ ‘Do what needs to be done in the lotus, Steadily, applying forethought, For Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa himself Dwells here—the great bliss.’
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-100}} “Then the sādhaka, visualizing himself in the form of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa and visualizing the wisdom consort in the form of Hatred Vajrī, should make love and note the four joys. When this is completed, he should offer the gaṇacakra feast with wine and meat, with the teacher as the guest of honor.
“This was the wisdom empowerment .”
This concludes the chapter on empowerments, the third in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called “ The Sole Hero .” {{page:{number:9,folio:F.308.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-101}} Then the goddess said:
“How should he meditate, The meditator on Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa? What mantra should he recite? Please tell me, O great lord!”
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-102}} The lord then said:
“In a place pleasing to the mind And free from all distractions, One whose mind is in equipoise Should prepare a pleasant seat.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-103}} “First one should cultivate loving kindness; Second, compassion; Third, sympathetic ‌joy; And, to complete the lot, ‌equanimity.

{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-106}} “One should take the triple refuge, supplicate the buddhas not to enter nirvāṇa, And request them to turn the wheel of Dharma. Having then offered one’s body, One should dedicate the merit.

{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-108}} “Reciting the following mantra, One should meditate on emptiness.

One, too, begets sons and daughters, who are, respectively, White Acala, Delusion Vajrī, and so forth. The sons, for their part, are patricides, wholly intent on fornication, and nothing but enemies.

When consciousness ceases, there is the cessation of name and form. When name and form cease, there is the cessation of the six cognitive fields.

When craving ceases, there is the cessation of grasping. When grasping ceases, there is the cessation of becoming. When becoming ceases, there is the cessation of birth.

{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-517}} “The world arises dependently; It ceases always dependently. When one understands these two modes And contemplates them as nondual, one will become accomplished.”
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-518}} Then the Blessed Lady said, “May the Blessed One present the analysis of ignorance, and so forth.”
Then the Blessed One said:
“This wheel has three divisions Corresponding to the three times. The Dharma is said by the victorious ones To have twelve forms.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-519}} “With regard to this, ignorance is to be unaware of what to abandon and what to adopt. The meaning is that, directly after death, the insubstantial mind assumes a physical shape.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-520}} “From this ignorance arise formations of which there are three types: (1) the formations of the body are exhalation and inhalation, (2) the formations of speech are speculative knowledge and analytical knowledge, and (3) the formations of mind are attachment, hatred, and delusion. Ignorance, combined with these formations, exhales and inhales; it wanders to and apprehends material objects, and it analyzes and apprehends that which is immaterial; it becomes infatuated, hostile, or bewildered. {{page:{number:50,folio:F.329.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-521}} “From these formations arises consciousness, which is sixfold: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness. When combined with these six, ignorance sees, hears, smells, tastes, feels, and cogitates.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-522}} “From this consciousness arise name and form. Name is the four aggregates, starting with sensation. Form is form alone. With these two put together and rolled into one, we have what is called name and form. The meaning is that ignorance takes on the form of the five aggregates that are grasped onto. Among these, sensation is threefold: pleasurable, painful, and neutral. Perception is the internal description of things after apprehending their particular forms. The formations are the primary and subsidiary mental states that apprehend the particular circumstances of general things. The consciousnesses have already been described. Form has the nature of four elements: (1) earth is characterized by heaviness and hardness; (2) water, by liquidity and fluidity; (3) fire, by heat and the ability to heat; and (4) wind, by its changing course, diffusiveness, and its being set into motion easily.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-523}} “From name and form arise six cognitive fields—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind fields. When combined with these six, ignorance sees and so forth, as explained previously.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-524}} “From these cognitive fields arises contact—meeting with forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, and the sphere of mentally cognized features.
“From contact arises craving, which is the desire for happiness.
“From craving arises grasping, which is seeking out the desired object.
“From grasping arises becoming, which is entry into the womb.
“From becoming arises birth, which is one’s visible emergence. This is the acquisition of the five perpetuating aggregates. {{page:{number:51,folio:F.329.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-525}} “From this birth arises old age, which is being old and worn-out, and death, which is the cessation of mind and its contents. {{note:{index:123,id:UT22084-080-015-2264}}} Then, reflecting on old age and death, one becomes overcome with grief. One laments, ‘I have not striven for liberation.’ Plagued by diseases, one is overcome by pain. Thinking about it again and again, one falls into depression. Even though one is already depressed, one is further assailed by misfortunes and becomes exasperated.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-526}} “The meaning is as follows. A being in the intermediate state after death possesses the full range of the six cognitive fields up to their furthest limit, which entails the fields governed by ignorance and so forth. Although remaining in just one place, that being will look at the three worlds and see a woman and a man making love. Driven by the karma created in his previous lives, he will perceive the couple making love in a form that corresponds to his future form of existence. Upon seeing them, the meeting occurs with great intensity.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-527}} “At that point, if one is going to be a man, one sees oneself in the form of a man. One feels extreme passion for one’s future mother and is overcome by intense hatred for one’s future father. The passion and the hatred are sensations of pleasure and pain respectively. Wondering how to have sex with the female, one is bewildered by that sensation, which is neither painful nor pleasurable.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-528}} “Then, out of great craving, which is impelled by the wind of one’s previous karma, one decides to make love to her. Upset, one thinks, ‘Who is that man having sex with my woman?’ Thinking this, one enters through the fontanel of one’s future father just like a falling star. Because one resides in the mind—the mind that abides in the father’s semen—one perceives oneself making love to one’s future mother and grasps at the pleasure. At that point, one has become essentially identical to the semen. Because of being excited with great passion, one passes through the central channel and emerges from the father’s vajra. Passing through the channel of the goddess of the Vajra Realm located in the orifice of the mother’s lotus, one is established in the birth channel of the womb. {{page:{number:52,folio:F.330.a}}} Subsequently a new life begins by internalizing the secretions.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-529}} “In due order, the stages of conceptus, embryonic nucleus, compacted matter, lump, and fetus with limbs unfold, and eventually one is born within nine or ten months, emerging through the same way that one entered. Thus a birth takes place.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-530}} “If, however, one is going to be a woman, one feels passion for the future father and hatred for the future mother. One then sees oneself as having a female form. Entering through the fontanel of the future mother, one falls into the vagina, becomes fused with the semen, and remains in her birth channel. Then, in the same way as before, one emerges and is born.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-531}} “So in this way, people are born into the world through ignorance and the rest. And these people are only the five aggregates. These five aggregates circle unhappily around in saṃsāra. But those who seek liberation should not occupy themselves with this suffering.
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-532}} “After the cessation of ignorance and the remaining links, the aggregates will also cease. {{note:{index:124,id:UT22084-080-015-2265}}} This cessation, however, would be an empty state {{note:{index:125,id:UT22084-080-015-2266}}} of no value to the seekers of liberation, who should not occupy themselves with useless things. {{note:{index:126,id:UT22084-080-015-2267}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-080-015-533}} “For such seekers, existence is not liberation, but nor is nonexistence. {{note:{index:127,id:UT22084-080-015-2268}}} They should instead practice the secret union of wisdom and means that is devoid of both existence and nonexistence. This union has the nature of great bliss; {{note:{index:128,id:UT22084-080-015-2269}}} it is the glorious lord Acala himself; it is the mind that has the single form of the four joys; it abides in neither existence nor nirvāṇa; it is liberation. {{note:{index:129,id:UT22084-080-015-2270}}}
