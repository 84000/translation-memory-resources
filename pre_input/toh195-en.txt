{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-061-015-18}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing in Rājagṛha at Vulture Peak Mountain, together with a great saṅgha of monks and a great many bodhisattva great beings.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-061-015-19}}}At that time, the Blessed One said to the {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-061-015-380,folio:F.251.b}}} bodhisattva Pure Intellect, “Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their discipline is pure. Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their absorption, patience, and beneficence are pure. Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their love is pure. Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their compassion is pure. Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their joy and equanimity are pure. Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their liberation and their liberated wisdom are pure. Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their powers are pure. Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their fearlessness, buddha qualities, and omniscient wisdom are pure.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-061-015-21}}}“Pure Intellect, this being so, the size of the mass of merit generated by someone who honors the pure thus-gone ones with flowers, garlands, perfumes, parasols, banners, flags, music, and ointments cannot be fathomed. Except for the final passing into nirvāṇa through any of the three vehicles, this heap of merit can never be depleted, even in the future. Why is that so? Pure Intellect, just as the thus-gone ones are immeasurable in terms of all their buddha qualities, the offerings made to the thus-gone ones are immeasurable, endless, {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-061-015-381,folio:F.252.a}}} inconceivable, incomparable, unfathomable, incalculable, boundless, and inexpressible.
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-061-015-22}}}“Pure Intellect, consider someone who honors, respects, venerates, worships, and reveres the thus-gone ones who live, thrive, and are well today. Then, consider someone who, in the future, during the final five-hundred-year period, honors, respects, venerates, worships, reveres, and holds dear a relic belonging to a thus-gone one who has passed into parinirvāṇa, even if it is as small as a mustard seed. Giving rise to the mind set on awakening, that person will pay homage to, prostrate to, honor, respect, venerate, worship, revere, supplicate, praise, and circumambulate this relic. Both of these persons will gain five benefits. What are these five benefits? They will be endowed with (1) mindfulness, (2) understanding, and (3) self-respect and propriety; (4) they will quickly meet a blessed buddha; and (5) faith will be born in them upon seeing that buddha. These are the five benefits that they will gain.
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-061-015-23}}}“Those persons will also possess four other qualities. What are these four qualities? (1) They will uphold the teachings of the thus-gone ones, (2) they will practice in accordance with these teachings, (3) they will come near to the blessed buddhas after having practiced in that way, and (4) they will swiftly be born in a pure buddhafield. These are the four qualities.
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-061-015-24}}}“Pure Intellect, if a bodhisattva fulfills four criteria, he or she will not be oppressed by Māra or any divine sons of Māra’s family. What are these four criteria? (1) Being born in a high and noble family, (2) directing one’s mind toward the blessed buddhas as soon as one is born, (3) upholding the sacred Dharma in later stages of life, and (4) always being blessed by the thus-gone ones, {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-061-015-382,folio:F.252.b}}} the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas. Pure Intellect, if a bodhisattva fulfills these four criteria, they will not be oppressed by Māra or any divine sons of Māra’s family.”
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-061-015-27}}}At that moment, the Blessed One uttered these verses:

Moreover, he may arouse devotion, thinking, ‘May my body become just like the bodies of the thus-gone ones, which are adorned with the thirty-two marks of a great being!’ Pure Intellect, in that case, the size of that heap of merit will be indescribable, because it is based on unsurpassed and perfect awakening. That heap of merit cannot be exhausted by becoming a king, Śakra, Brahmā, a solitary buddha, or even a practitioner of the unsurpassed vehicle of the perfect buddhas. Why is that so? Because, Pure Intellect, such a noble son is in possession of an inconceivable heap of merit. Pure Intellect, consider the Thus-Gone One who has awakened to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. Whenever he is entering a city, a monastery, or a village, and whether he is walking, standing, sitting, or teaching the Dharma, all beings without exception in this great trichiliocosm—gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-061-015-385,folio:F.254.a}}} and nonhumans—will bow, salute, and prostrate in his direction. Even the trees, mountains, mines, caves, and rock shelters will do so.

And awaken to the state of buddhahood!”
