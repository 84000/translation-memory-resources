The Heaven of the Thirty-Three
{{milestone:{label:4.B.434,id:UT22084-068-021-2829}}}“When the monk has seen the gods of the Four Great Kings, he will next examine the realms of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three and its associated karmic actions. Thus, he will ask himself, ‘How do positive and negative karmic actions relate to beings taking birth among the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three?’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.435,id:UT22084-068-021-2830}}} “As he applies knowledge derived from hearing, he will then correctly perceive the following realms of the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three: Dwelling in Sudharma, Dwelling in the Lofty, Dwelling on Summits, Dwelling in Excellent View, Dwelling in One Direction, Dwelling in Forests, Dwelling in Various Chariots, Dwelling in Enjoyment, Dwelling in Beauty, Dwelling by the Pārijāta Tree, Dwelling on Mixed Riverbanks, Dwelling on Forest Riverbanks, Dwelling in Essence of Jewels, Engaging in Clarification, House of Refined Gold, Shaded by Garlands, Moving on Springy Ground, Distinguished in Many Colorful Ways, Subtle Engagement, Enraptured by and Attached to Song, Blazing Splendor, Resembling the Full Moon, Pair of Śāla Trees, Moving in the Wink of an Eye, Fine Complexion and Large Body, Draped with Jewels, {{page:{number:691,id:UT22084-068-021-100718,folio:F.110.a,volume:V69}}} Part of the Assembly, Dwelling on the Disk, High Conduct, Supreme Splendor, Garland of Splendor, and Unmixed. Thus, thirty-three classes of gods inhabit thirty-three realms.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.436,id:UT22084-068-021-2831}}} “Next, the monk who has comprehension of the ripening of the effects of karmic actions and discipline will examine the positive completed actions of those gods. Doing so, he wonders, ‘What are the completed and accumulated karmic actions that produce such happy realms, such desirable and attractive ripening, such happy ripening, such congregations of teachers,{{note:{index:276,id:UT22084-068-021-2832}}} and such delightful sounds, textures, tastes, and maturations?’
The Gods Dwelling in Sudharma
{{milestone:{label:4.B.437,id:UT22084-068-021-2834}}} “Examining this matter with knowledge derived from hearing, he will understand that, apart from the teaching of the buddhas, no other amazing sight or sound is necessary for attaining those joyous and blissful realms for which there is no example. At Sudharma, the assembly hall of the gods, Kauśika rules in accordance with the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.438,id:UT22084-068-021-2835}}} “By paying attention to the external features, the monk will start out by examining the first level of the gods and from there proceed to distinguish the designs of all the other grounds. He will ask himself how discipline may be cultivated so as to result in birth in the divine assembly hall of Sudharma. Inquiring with knowledge derived from hearing, he will then see how some people may practice sevenfold discipline in a way that is uncorrupted, unbroken, intact, genuine, and special. When it comes time to practice that generosity in which they have trained their minds thoroughly, they will be unstinting and helpful. In this way they will offer gifts to worthy ones, ailing parents, non-returners, once-returners, stream enterers, those arisen from cessation, those who have entered the path, and those trained in love, compassion, joy, and equanimity, or they may offer vitality to those who are afraid of dying and whose lives are threatened. When such people later separate from their bodies, they will go to the joyful higher realms and become the rulers of gods, residing within Sudharma, the divine assembly hall. Thus, they will reside within the assembly hall of Śakra Kauśika, {{page:{number:692,id:UT22084-068-021-100719,folio:F.110.b,volume:V69}}} enjoying themselves while being served by a retinue of nine million nine hundred thousand lovely and endearing goddesses. Each god will be served by such a retinue, and each goddess will be just as caring as a single wife to her only husband. Among the goddesses there will be a lovely, endearing, and sympathetic primary queen. All the goddesses will wait upon this queen and the queen will be respectful toward them all in return.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.439,id:UT22084-068-021-2836}}} “The divine assembly hall of Sudharma measures five hundred leagues. Its foundation is made of beryl and its exceptionally attractive columns are of coral. The fences are made of crystal adorned with coral. The walls are of refined gold studded with diamonds. The delightful jewel thrones are studded with gorgeous rubies and sapphires.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.440,id:UT22084-068-021-2837}}} “At certain places there are lotus flowers with beryl petals and vajra anthers. These lotuses do not grow from mud but from even ground that is beautifully adorned with gold, and the like. Among some of the lotus ponds swim songbirds with feathers of beryl, beaks of ruby, and dark blue bodies. Such birds fill the lotus ponds.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.441,id:UT22084-068-021-2838}}} “Elsewhere the ponds are full of other kinds of jewel birds. With legs of beryl, dark blue feathers, beaks of coral, and eyes the color of coral, other birds occupy the land between the ponds. Still other ponds are home to different birds. Their bodies are made of gold from the Jambu River, they have coral feathers, their eyes are extremely gentle, and their legs are the color of pearls.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.442,id:UT22084-068-021-2839}}} “Other ponds are abuzz with beryl-colored, ecstatic bees. Such bees adorn the following ten great pools that add further beauty to the divine assembly hall of Sudharma: Source of Joy, Source of Great Lotuses, Utter Joy, Great and Utter Joy, Playful Frolicking, Fulfillment of Wishes, Ever-Present Chariots, Movement, Enjoyment of Wish-fulfilling Trees, and Powerful Luminous Retreat. Such lakes adorn Sudharma, the assembly hall of the gods.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.443,id:UT22084-068-021-2840}}} “There are also other lotus groves in which the flower stems are of silver, the anthers of gold, and the petals {{page:{number:693,id:UT22084-068-021-100720,folio:F.111.a,volume:V69}}} of beryl. The cores of these flowers that do not grow from mud are the color of diamonds. Other lotuses have stalks colored like diamond, and petals that are a mix of ruby, beryl, coral, and gold, thus giving each lotus numerous colors. Some of the lotuses that belong to Śakra, king of the gods, have a hundred petals. Others have two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, five hundred, six hundred, seven hundred, eight hundred, nine hundred, or a thousand petals. Some have many colors and some just one. Some move and some are fixed. Such are the lotuses that grow at Śakra’s residence, the divine assembly hall of Sudharma.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.444,id:UT22084-068-021-2841}}} “Heavenly birds enter among the lotuses and fill the meadows. The birds are infatuated throughout the year, they have glistening cheeks,{{note:{index:277,id:UT22084-068-021-2842}}} and they always dance to the sound of music. When Śakra visits the ponds and frolics there with his retinue of goddesses, the birds are equally joyous, and the songs they sing sound like the five types of instruments. The bird known as crazed by infatuation is a great dancer. When Śakra enjoys himself by the ponds, this bird comes to dance in the same way as the goddesses. Golden birds known as dwelling on the outskirts will then arrive, carrying flower garlands in their beaks. Those birds will then dance and sing by the ponds and on their banks. In this way the monk will regard the ponds of Śakra, king of the gods.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.445,id:UT22084-068-021-2843}}} “Next the monk will examine the manifestations of positive karmic action that appear at Sudharma, Śakra’s divine assembly hall. Thus, he will notice how the ponds feature various fish. Some are colored like gold, {{page:{number:694,id:UT22084-068-021-100721,folio:F.111.b,volume:V69}}} some like silver, and some like beryl. The scales of the fish are ruby colored, their eyes are like coral, and their bellies like lotuses. Some of the fish have backs that are adorned with colorful spheres of various jewels, some have scales that are colored like the seven precious substances. Such are the fish that frolic in the ponds.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.446,id:UT22084-068-021-2844}}} “As the monk continues to examine the lotus ponds of Śakra, he will wonder what their different designs might be. Thus, with knowledge derived from hearing he will see that at some places there are sand beds made of pearls, whereas elsewhere the sand is of silver, gold, or beryl. Such are the colorful designs that manifest from Śakra’s positive karmic actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.447,id:UT22084-068-021-2845}}} “As the monk continues to examine those designs, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing and see that some pools have banks that are surrounded by railings of gold, whereas other ponds feature railings of beryl, silver, or gold draped with nets of pearls. The banks of the lotus ponds are full of birds of variegated colors that sing joyous tunes and dart about.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.448,id:UT22084-068-021-2846}}} “As the monk who has knowledge of the effects of the ripening of karmic actions continues to examine Sudharma, the divine assembly hall, he will notice how the lotus flowers in the ponds are visited by bees of myriad colors. Thus, silver-colored bees visit golden lotuses. The wings of the bees are like vajra sprouts and delightful to touch. Similarly, golden bees visit silver lotuses. In this way, numerous bees fly among the lotus flowers. The monk recognizes that all these things are the varied effects of virtuous actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.449,id:UT22084-068-021-2847}}} “As the monk continues to examine the divine assembly hall of Sudharma, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing and so proceed to examine the surrounding forests. Wondering what kinds of forests Śakra, king of the gods, {{page:{number:695,id:UT22084-068-021-100722,folio:F.112.a,volume:V69}}} may possess, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing. Thus, he will examine each of the forests located at Sudharma, the divine assembly hall. There are four such forests, known as Joyous Women, Joyous, Incomparable, and Colorful. The monk will examine each of these forests within which Śakra, ruler of the gods, surrounded by goddesses, enjoys heavenly pleasures of the five senses, reveling in his playful experience of forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.450,id:UT22084-068-021-2848}}} “Wondering what delightful features the forests may contain, the monk will then apply knowledge derived from hearing and so notice the forest known as Joyous Women. The heavenly trees of this forest are adorned with flowers and fruits and are visited by numerous birds. Known as wish fulfillers and wish granters, the trees yield whatever the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three may wish. When the gods go to the forest to play, the trees will bloom with large and exquisite flowers. Thus, when females enter the forest and approach the trees to pluck the flowers, the trees will extend themselves as soon as the women arrive. When they have plucked their flowers, the trees will immediately grow new flowers that display fresh and different colors, scents, shapes, and features. Anything the goddesses wish for appears from the trees.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.451,id:UT22084-068-021-2849}}} “The trees may also transform and produce a fivefold, delightful music of sitars, drums, cymbals, flutes, and vīṇās. {{page:{number:696,id:UT22084-068-021-100723,folio:F.112.b,volume:V69}}} Whatever the goddesses may wish to listen to, that sound will emerge from the trees. As soon as a given wish for music has occurred, a wind produced by wholesome karmic action will stir among the leaves of the trees. As the wind touches the leaves, each leaf will produce the sound of music. Enrapturing music of the five instruments—sitars, drums, cymbals, flutes, and vīṇās—will thus ring out from the leaves. Because of this, the trees are known as wish fulfillers.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.452,id:UT22084-068-021-2850}}} “The trees also display other wish-fulfilling features. For instance, whenever the passionate goddesses develop a wish for a certain ornament, garment, or fruit, the trees will immediately produce whatever was desired, all the while remaining resplendent. Because of this, too, the trees are known as wish fulfillers.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.453,id:UT22084-068-021-2851}}} “Some of the trees have the color of beryl and bear golden leaves. Some have golden trunks, silver branches, beryl flower petals, and keraṭaka{{note:{index:278,id:UT22084-068-021-2852}}} leaves. Some trees bear leaves of the seven precious substances and yield various delicious fruits.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.454,id:UT22084-068-021-2853}}} “The trees are also wish-fulfilling in the following way. Whenever a goddess wishes to see Śakra, she will behold a magical emanation of the ruler of the gods, produced by Śakra’s positive karmic actions. This emanation will then revel and frolic with the goddess. In this way, emanations of millions of such rulers of the gods may appear. In front of the trees may stand nine hundred and ninety million goddesses, yet a ruler of the gods will appear to each one of them. Thus, the goddesses may play and frolic with their individual emanation but without being able to see one another. Whenever a goddess brings the features and ornaments of Śakra to mind she will immediately perceive that which she had in mind, and in this way be with him. In this way she will be able to frolic with him within the forest for as long as she wishes. Because of this, too, the trees are known as wish fulfillers. {{page:{number:697,id:UT22084-068-021-100724,folio:F.113.a,volume:V69}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.B.455,id:UT22084-068-021-2854}}} “As the monk investigates the forest, he will notice that it contains a mountain known as Mount Playful. This mountain, which is made of the seven precious substances, functions as a dwelling place, since it has a vajra dome made of vajra sprouts and a mesh of golden twigs. It is filled with golden, silver, and sapphire deer, and numerous birds sing there. Upon that delightful mountain sits the mansion called Victorious Supreme Movement with its one thousand beautiful pillars. The pillars are constructed of gold, silver, and sapphire and studded with diamonds and large pearls. Within the mansion rest beryl thrones clad with rainbow-colored covers{{note:{index:279,id:UT22084-068-021-2855}}} and colorful mats, and soft cushions are arranged upon them. One thousand such beautiful thrones can be found within the mansion. When Śakra has been victorious in the gods’ wars against the asuras, he adorns himself and proceeds to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three to celebrate with all the gods. Later, goddesses will come to the mansion to play, sing, dance, perform, and participate in games. Thus, everyone enjoys themselves corresponding with their bad, good, or intermediate karmic actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.456,id:UT22084-068-021-2856}}} “At times the goddesses will descend from the mansion of Victorious Supreme Movement. They will then stay on Mount Playful, passionately pursuing nothing but desire and enjoying one another in this way. While all women in the higher realms are abundantly desirous, this is particularly the case among the gods. While roaming the mountain they arrive in places where they find food and drink of all sorts of colors, fragrances, and tastes. There will also be intoxicating beverages. Thus, they will find an abundance of exquisite divine forms, smells, and tastes. The beverages are free from the flaws of inebriation, and when the goddesses partake of these uplifting drinks, they will become extremely joyous. When they consume the beverage known as vision giver, {{page:{number:698,id:UT22084-068-021-100725,folio:F.113.b,volume:V69}}} they will be able to see heavenly forests and parks that lie beyond many mountains. The drink called sundry tastes yields an abundance of delicious tastes, and when the goddesses partake of it, their joy, complexions, physiques, and strength will intensify a hundred times.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.457,id:UT22084-068-021-2857}}} “When the goddesses look for food, they will find sustenance that corresponds with their own bad, intermediate, or excellent karmic actions. Thus, as the products of their karmic actions, they will find foods of exquisite taste, color, scent, and texture. Moreover, the nature of their drinks is the product of their karmic actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.458,id:UT22084-068-021-2858}}} “When the goddesses have consumed their drinks and ambrosial foods they will next visit musical performances on Mount Playful. There, to the beat of golden drums, they will hear the delightful tunes of vīṇās that are made of beryl, adorned with gold leaf, and equipped with strings of gold. Likewise, the goddesses will also see numerous hollow bamboos that are intertwined.{{note:{index:280,id:UT22084-068-021-2859}}} They will have tremendous fun with cymbals, flutes, string instruments, and other musical instruments. Wearing all manner of fine jewelry, they will take up the instruments and play them so as to delight one another, stir various passions, intensify desires, captivate those who live in the forest, and produce tremendous passion of the most exquisite kind.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.459,id:UT22084-068-021-2860}}} “When they have played the instruments, the goddesses will next go to a place where beautiful tunes produced by the ringing and tinkling of small bells can be heard. As the breeze carries the tunes, the melodious ringing is enriched a hundred times. The goddesses, equipped with their variegated attire, outfits, and ornaments, are overjoyed upon hearing these tunes and thus begin to dance, frolic, and sing.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.460,id:UT22084-068-021-2861}}} “When satisfied by these sounds, they will proceed to descend from that place and instead visit ponds that are adorned with swans and yellow geese. {{page:{number:699,id:UT22084-068-021-100726,folio:F.114.a,volume:V69}}} Swans, ducks, yellow geese, and various other golden and silvery birds embellish these ponds, and the goddesses will enter the water to play there. Free from the flaws of stinginess and envy, the goddesses will tap one another with the golden, silvery, and beryl-like stems of lotus flowers, and so they will for a long time prattle and play in the water, which is endowed with the eight features and all the good qualities of water. They will also play with the birds in the ponds.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.461,id:UT22084-068-021-2862}}} “Later, the goddesses will develop abundant passion. Thus, they will enjoy this passion and perpetuate it until it overtakes them, and they become insatiable. Thirsting for the objects of their passions, they will decide to go somewhere else. As they enter the so-called Mirror Forest, they will see their bodies reflected, adorned with their various garments and jewelry, and so they will see gorgeous and diverse reflections of themselves. Within various mirrors they will see their own exquisite qualities, garments, and perfect adornments, and in that way their excitement about their physical appearance increases tenfold. There are three ways that women become crazed by excitement: because of their looks, because of men, and because of pride. Those who become madly excited by seeing their own bodies will no longer think that any other female can at all qualify as a woman.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.462,id:UT22084-068-021-2863}}} “From the site where these mirrors are found, the goddesses will next proceed to another part of the forest known as All Seasons. All six seasons are represented there and continue to revolve, like a spinning wheel. Thus, the forest has specific regions of early winter, late winter, spring, summer, monsoon, and fall. The beautiful, colorful birds that adorn the forest likewise follow the seasons. The goddesses will enter this forest for their pleasure. They do so as friends, free from disagreement, envy, or displeasure, {{page:{number:700,id:UT22084-068-021-100727,folio:F.114.b,volume:V69}}} and filled with mutual care, affection, and love. When they see the forest, they will enter whichever season they prefer and then play and enjoy themselves there. Since the forest displays all the different seasons, it inspires the goddesses to play. Thus, they will enjoy themselves and play with the flocks of birds until they feel like doing something else. Finally, the playful and utterly joyous goddesses will go to the residence of Śakra, ruler of the gods. When they see their husband, the goddesses, who are accomplished in various arts, will surround him, dancing and singing. Such are the perfect qualities of one of the forests of Śakra, ruler of the gods. This is what just one of his forests is like.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.463,id:UT22084-068-021-2864}}}“Next, the monk will examine the second among the forests of Śakra, king of the gods. The monk will wonder, ‘What are the features of that forest, and what is it called?’ Through knowledge derived from hearing he will understand that the forest is called Joyous. Wondering about the extent of the forest’s fine qualities, the monk will apply knowledge derived from hearing and so understand that by its very nature this forest is a place of joy, for it is full of ecstatically joyous gods and goddesses. They remain very close to one another, and their noble faces increase one another’s beauty.{{note:{index:281,id:UT22084-068-021-2865}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.B.464,id:UT22084-068-021-2866}}} “Surrounded by one hundred thousand divine maidens, Śakra, king of the gods, comes to this forest for pleasure. As he goes to this park, Śakra is accompanied by eighty-four thousand beryl chariots that are draped in nets of small bells. Some of the chariots are adorned with the head of a horse made of gold from the Jambu River, the sides of the chariots are clad in silver, and they are adorned with the seven precious substances. Some of the chariots are pulled by swans. Some of them fly through the sky, others move across the earth. {{page:{number:701,id:UT22084-068-021-100728,folio:F.115.a,volume:V69}}} Amid singing and the sound of instruments and music, the leaders of the gods thus travel as Śakra’s retinue.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.465,id:UT22084-068-021-2867}}} “Eighty-four thousand strong and agile elephants saunter alongside them, draped in nets of gold. Large and small bells hang from their bodies, on their backs lie colorful carpets and cushions, and from their cheeks trickle drops of clear silver.{{note:{index:282,id:UT22084-068-021-2868}}} Singing and playing divine music, leaders of the gods ride upon those elephants, all the while gazing at the face of Śakra. Such is his retinue on the way to the forest.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.466,id:UT22084-068-021-2869}}} “There are also eighty-four thousand goddesses who accompany Śakra, gazing at his face. They wear various garments and ornaments and have a variety of skin colors and physical shapes. Some dance, some sing, some play the five types of instruments, and some engage in various games as they proceed to the forest.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.467,id:UT22084-068-021-2870}}} “There are also dancers who perform and entertain and gaze at Śakra’s face as they advance into the forest. They are dressed in the four costumes, have various shapely physiques, and sport a variety of fashions.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.468,id:UT22084-068-021-2871}}} “Amid this retinue travels Śakra together with Śaci. Their chariot has wheels with a hundred spokes and is adorned with beryl, gold, coral, ruby, lapis lazuli, and great sapphires. The chariot is pulled by a hundred thousand swans whose bodies are of a color like gold from the Jambu River, their legs like coral, their eyes like tiger eye, their bodies like ruby, their beaks like coral, and their feathers like pearls. The swans carry Śakra wherever he wishes. Thus, within this supreme chariot rides Śakra together with Śaci. Adorned with various precious stones and more splendid than a hundred suns, he travels to the forest. Śaci’s form, attire, and jewelry are a hundred times more perfect than any of the other goddesses. Occupying half of Śakra’s seat, she thus rides to forest. {{page:{number:702,id:UT22084-068-021-100729,folio:F.115.b,volume:V69}}}

Crazed by heavenly sounds, textures, tastes, forms, and smells, they surround Śakra, ruler of the gods, as he tours the forests and parks, riding his golden chariot together with Śaci, just as mentioned before. While he enjoys a hundred thousand pleasures, the ruler of the gods is honored from chariots and elephants by gods and divine dignitaries with the sounds of instruments, song, and music as they all journey to the forest.

Then they will rush forth with tremendous joy. As they emerge from the forest, they will carry lotus flowers, play instruments, and sing beautiful songs.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.471,id:UT22084-068-021-2874}}} “When Śakra, ruler of the gods, sees this, he will say to the gods, ‘O gods, those goddesses saw me approaching and have now come out to welcome us with instruments and music.

They proceed due to the force of karmic action. Karmic action is their master and their support, and on that they rely. They are what they are due to negative, neutral, and positive actions. Under the power of karmic actions, they engaged in negative, {{page:{number:703,id:UT22084-068-021-100730,folio:F.116.a,volume:V69}}} neutral, or positive acts.’

In this way, they each have their own particular attire, form, and demeanor, and they all have their own unique way of singing and playing music. Thus, these hundreds or thousands of goddesses, who have manifested due to a number of wholesome karmic actions, now appear in extremely skillful ways.

Śakra is delighted, and the goddesses each sing their own beautiful and soothing songs to the tunes of the five types of instruments. Thousands of goddesses offer praise as they hear the sounds of small bells and flutes emerging from the eighty-four thousand bejeweled chariots and the eighty-four thousand elephants. At the same time, nine million nine hundred thousand goddesses form the retinue. In this way, the lord of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three enjoys pleasures of the body and mind for which no example exists. Why is that so?

When the gods realize that consuming these fruits has an extremely infatuating effect, they will bend down the branches of the trees and let their elephants eat the fruits. As they consume the fruits, the elephants become inebriated and boisterously romp about. The gods will then say, ‘Ah, our elephants are inebriated and boisterously romp about.

Within this fruit’s hard shell is a fragrant flesh called the sweet one, which has many beautiful colors. The gods pick the fruits, split them open, and drink from them. The fruits taste sweeter than honey, and they produce inebriation without any of the negative side effects of intoxication.

At that point, his reflection will again appear upon the surface of the wall.
 “Śakra, king of the gods, will now think, ‘I shall go to the divine assembly hall of Sudharma to see the gods there.’

The forest Colorful abounds with beautiful birds, trees, lotus ponds, pools, and parks. When the gods and goddesses who live there see Śakra, king of the gods, they will take up their cymbals and various instruments and approach him. As they approach him, they will address him sincerely and minister to him, all of them performing dances, singing, and engaging in merrymaking. At this time, walking in front of Śakra, an attending troupe of goddesses striking various poses and wearing various garments will play musical instruments. In this way, Śakra will proceed to the divine assembly hall of Sudharma. Everyone will follow him delightedly, playing cymbals and various instruments, dancing, laughing, rollicking, and making merry.

As the great assembly of deeply joyous gods {{page:{number:718,id:UT22084-068-021-100745,folio:F.123.b,volume:V69}}} perform dances and sing extremely beautiful songs, their tunes fill the entire realm of gods. When the gods that reside in other heavenly forests and parks hear those tunes, they will also experience the divine pleasures of the five senses, and they too will frolic and enjoy themselves. They will then also proceed to the divine assembly hall. Once there, they will address Śakra sincerely and request him to proceed victoriously. Thereupon Śakra will journey to the divine assembly hall of Sudharma accompanied by many hundreds of thousands of gods. Due to their various virtuous actions, the gods sing and dance and wear variegated garments and ornaments. To be born among them is an effect of having observed and cultivated discipline well.

It features beautiful trees of beryl and other magnificent trees, as well as delicate blooming flowers with exceedingly delectable fragrances that can be sensed from a distance of five leagues. The abode is attractive, delightful, beautiful, agreeable, and unconquerable, and everyone at the divine assembly hall is protected by Śakra. In this way, everyone there enjoys pleasures of the five senses, frolicking together with Śakra and a throng of nine hundred million goddesses.

It is certain that once those deeds are exhausted, we will fall. We ended up here among the gods in accordance with our karmic actions and we are now experiencing our share of karmic effects. But in the end, we will once again fall. Therefore, gods, acknowledge all this suffering and do what is virtuous!’

So enough with this mind that is constantly attached to afflictions! It brings endless suffering and nothing good. Its nature is nothing good. It does not yield knowledge of causes and conditions—it produces them. It prevents us from understanding how vast this suffering is. When you die, most of you will leave these lofty realms and take rebirth among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. Thus, those who are born here due to their positive actions will come to experience their share of karmic effects. That is how they experience the pleasures of the gods in heaven. Yet when karmic actions turn against them, they will fall, and their experience will become that of the hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. Gods, {{page:{number:720,id:UT22084-068-021-100747,folio:F.124.b,volume:V69}}} you must therefore be extremely careful about this!

This entire great mass of suffering arises in that way. Furthermore, when ignorance ceases, formation will cease; when formation ceases, consciousness will cease; when consciousness ceases, name and form will cease; when name and form cease, the six sense sources will cease; when the six sense sources cease, contact will cease; when contact ceases, sensation will cease; when sensation ceases, craving will cease; when craving ceases, grasping will cease; when grasping ceases, becoming will cease; when becoming ceases, birth will cease; and when birth ceases, old age and death, grief, lamentation, suffering, distress, and disturbance will all cease.

This, gods, is how living beings {{page:{number:721,id:UT22084-068-021-100748,folio:F.125.a,volume:V69}}} achieve liberation from cyclic existence.

They will develop single-pointed faith in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, and plant the seed of the transcendence of suffering by engaging in actions that lead to bliss. Those who have not trained their minds, on the other hand, will once more become careless and disturbed. Fooled by craving, they will again pursue the enjoyment of their wealth of divine pleasures of the five senses. Thus, those who are deceived will play and enjoy themselves, and there will be no end to their suffering in cyclic existence.

From a distance they will see him residing upon his throne, surrounded by his divine retinue, blazing with splendor and endowed with the incomparable pleasures of the gods. The four guardians will then approach. As they come before Śakra, they will address him sincerely and take their places upon supremely delightful, divine seats. After a while they will then rise from their supremely delightful, divine seats and, {{page:{number:722,id:UT22084-068-021-100749,folio:F.125.b,volume:V69}}} facing Śakra, they will address him as follows: ‘Ruler of the gods, in Jambudvīpa people endeavor in the ten virtuous actions and they delight in the sacred Dharma.

In this regard, they will say, ‘In Jambudvīpa there are unrighteous people who pursue improper activities. They do not respect their mothers, their fathers, mendicants, or brahmins, and they do not follow the elders of their families.

Gods, prepare yourselves!’

The beautiful trees in this forest display divine colors of gold, silver, beryl, sapphire, and ruby, and the garden is adorned with divine flowers. Flocks of delightful songbirds flutter about in this park, which also features exquisite ponds full of divine lotus flowers. This great park is where Airāvaṇa, Śakra’s elephant, plays with his elephant cows in the ponds, as described previously. Within groves of beryl lotuses, he frolics with his elephant cows. Just as Śakra, king of the gods, is attended to by various groups of gods and goddesses, so the king of elephants enjoys a similar situation. Among lotuses of refined gold that beautify him with a wonderful light that resembles the dawn of a hundred thousand suns, he enjoys himself, reveling and frolicking. Although he is an animal, he nevertheless experiences divine pleasures.

Inside the mansion, the king of gods will proceed to frolic and enjoy himself along with nine hundred million goddesses. Together they will romp, take pleasure, and revel in their exquisite endowments of divine pleasures of the five senses.

Until that point, they will keep playing and enjoying themselves to the tune of music from the five types of instruments. Once they die at the divine assembly hall of Sudharma, they will, in accordance with their karmic actions that remain to be experienced, be born among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. If they are born as humans, in accordance with their causal actions they will have perfect happiness and pure intellects. They will become leaders of families, towns, lands, and cities.

In those forests, by those rivers, and upon that ground, food and beverages flow like rivers. {{page:{number:731,id:UT22084-068-021-100758,folio:F.130.a,volume:V69}}} This is where these gods enjoy themselves with divine music, divine dwellings, and divine garments of unwoven fabrics.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.591,id:UT22084-068-021-3010}}} “The bodies of these gods are luminous and without flesh, bones, pus, or blood. Their bodies, voices, and minds are free from weariness, and they remain thoroughly at ease in both body and mind. Thus, they continue to enjoy themselves, frolicking and reveling, until finally their virtuous physical and verbal acts, which are desirable, attractive, delightful, and cooling, and which yield a supremely blissful ripening that is only experienced in the higher realms, have been exhausted. Once that happens, they will die, leave their divine world, and take birth among hell beings, animals, or starving spirits. Alternatively, karmic actions to be experienced in other lives that produce a human existence may cause them to take birth as humans. In that case they will, in accordance with their causal actions, enjoy constant mental happiness and have playful thoughts. They will sport and frolic and be born in an excellent land.
The Gods in Dwelling in Excellent View
{{milestone:{label:4.B.592,id:UT22084-068-021-3012}}}“As the monk who has knowledge of the effects of the ripening of karmic actions continues to examine the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, he will wonder which other places those gods may live in. When he examines this matter with knowledge derived from hearing, he will correctly perceive a god realm known as Dwelling in Excellent View. Wondering what karmic actions may cause beings to be born among the gods there, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing. He will then notice the following instances. People may observe discipline, or they may, without any regard for their own welfare, save the lives or possessions of others who are about to be killed by weapons or who have been taken by a river. Alternatively, some people may suffer from hunger when traveling. Even though others may encourage them to steal, they refrain from doing so. Other people may find themselves in the wilderness, fearing for their survival. Even so, they will not begin to collect fruits and roots unless they have received permission to do so. {{page:{number:732,id:UT22084-068-021-100759,folio:F.130.b,volume:V69}}} Such beings fear becoming disrespectful toward the observance of discipline and they are frightened of even the smallest infraction of the bases of training.

The grounds there are made of gold from the Jambu River, and the mansions are made of beryl, silver, gold from the Jambu River, or various sapphires. There are also beautiful thrones made of the seven precious substances. The roads are magnificent, and the road crossings, doors, gates, rooftops, and mansions are all extraordinary. Whenever there is no sunlight, the houses become like lanterns—in such instances, these supreme buildings glow like torches and emit light.

In others, the trees are made of gold and draped with nets of silver. Some have silver trees covered with nets of small golden bells. In some parks the trees are of the seven precious substances. In some grow wish-fulfilling trees that provide whatever the gods may want. Some groves are of lapis lazuli and beryl and within them golden birds sing beautifully in many ways. Within groves of golden trees, silver-colored birds sing and play. Within groves of sapphire, stunning ruby-colored birds sing delightfully and play.

All of them measure two hundred fifty leagues and within them flow tens of thousands of streams with golden embankments. The streams are extremely delightful, and their firm banks are adorned with gold, silver, crystal, beryl, and gorgeous trees. Swarms of beautiful bees with beryl wings and silver bodies zip around in the forests, and their humming is so melodious that the sound of any human flute cannot match even a sixteenth of their beauty. The beryl trees grow golden fruits that are extremely fragrant—much more so than any herb—and their fragrance can be sensed within a league. The birds that live there are infatuated by their very nature, and yet when they smell the fruits their infatuation increases a hundredfold. From the golden trees grow silver fruits, of heavenly scent and color, endowed with five tastes. On trees with beryl trunks grow leaves of gold and multicolored fruits. Thus, the forests are endowed with copious colors and various extraordinary features, transcending all comparisons. {{page:{number:734,id:UT22084-068-021-100761,folio:F.131.b,volume:V69}}} Such forests surround the great city of Excellent View.

Its trees and mansions are adorned with gold and various types of coral, festooned with nets of small bells, and decked out with nets of golden bells that chime melodiously. Within such groves, parks, and gardens reside the gods of Dwelling in Excellent View. Within this divine city, the ornate buildings resound with music and the ringing of cymbals.

Some of their chariots are made of beryl and are equipped with drawbars of ruby. Their interiors are of coral and the outer structure of beryl. The platforms are of gold and the chariots are festooned with small bells that ring beautifully. These gods also travel in other fine chariots. In some chariots the drawbars are of gold and the sidings are made of pearl. The platforms are of coral, the outer structures are decorated with emerald, the sides are of coral, and the shafts of silver. Other gods travel in supreme chariots in which the drawbars are of gold, the sides draped with pearls, the platforms studded with rubies, the shafts of silver, and the chariots overall decorated with coral. Thus the gods travel to their parks, riding in many hundreds of thousands of such brilliant chariots that are endowed with incomparable features. From poles of silver fly banners of gold. Banners are attached to poles of ruby. Banners and standards of bountiful colors are raised to the sky, one next to the other. Thus, it is in sheer joy that the gods travel to the four great gardens to partake of enjoyments. They travel to the accompaniment of hundreds of thousands of instruments that play many different musical melodies, all of them distinguished by exceptionally excellent and delightful qualities. {{page:{number:736,id:UT22084-068-021-100763,folio:F.132.b,volume:V69}}}

Accompanied by such offering goddesses, they proceed to the great parks. The goddesses are endowed with divine pleasures of the five senses, and as they meet with the gods, they dance, flirt, and play. In this way the gods develop attachment to pleasure and thus they frolic. Heavenly music fills the jungles as the gods revel in their divine enjoyments on their way to the parks.

Some fetch colorful horses with harmonious and agreeable gaits, attach their chariots to them, and thus travel in chariots drawn by horses. There are also some who ride on golden geese whose legs are of beryl and whose feathers are the color of ruby. Thus, the gods travel with Śakra, ruler of gods, to the city of Excellent View and its parks. Other gods ride on peacocks whose bodies are of the seven precious substances. If even in the world of humans the array of a peacock’s feathers constitutes a perfect form, it goes without saying that this is also the case in the heavens that are adorned by the exceptionally positive, karmic actions of the gods.

Once they are done playing in the orchard, they will next go to a wine grove to partake of drinks that are free from detrimental side effects of intoxication and do not cause dismay. The wines are perfectly delicious, and their tastes adjust themselves to the individual preferences of the gods. Śakra, king of the gods, will then dismount his perfect chariot and proceed to the park, where he takes a seat among the gods. When the gods see that their ruler has arrived, they become delighted and pay homage to him.  Everyone will then join their palms above their heads and worship the ruler of the gods, saying, ‘When the ruler of the gods thus remains present, our lives bear fruit. {{page:{number:742,id:UT22084-068-021-100769,folio:F.135.b,volume:V69}}} Śakra, king of the gods, sustains and provides for us in a way that surpasses even that of parents.’ In this manner, they will properly venerate Śakra.

Food and drink flow like rivers and there is an abundance of fruits. Mandārava flowers, lotuses, and other magnificent flowers adorn the land. Within the thicket, divine men and women engage in joking, playing, and rollicking. The five types of instruments can be heard throughout the parks where the gods and goddesses thus partake of divine food and are pleased by divine objects of the five senses.

If, due to karmic actions to be experienced in other lives, they should be born with the general lot in life of a human, they will, in accordance with those causal karmic actions, live in tremendous, constant happiness. Their intellects will be flawless, and they will be fond of music, dance, singing, joking, and playing.

Wondering what karmic actions may cause beings to be born among the gods there, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing. He will then notice how a disciplined person whose possessions are extremely few and of low quality may take the valuables and food of others. Despite his intense suffering, such a person may then not only give the things he obtains to his children and spouse, but with a well-trained mind, he may also distribute these things among others who are afflicted, and who resort to begging, are destitute, and without a protector. However, because of his attachment to the pleasures of a sexual relationship with someone else’s spouse, that person may then be apprehended and served a death sentence. Thus, he may be delivered into the hands of his executioners and led through the southern gate on the way to the place of execution. Still, in the midst of such calamity, he may succeed in escaping.

Thereafter manifests a belt in the colors of the rainbow, and finally shoes that are studded with the seven precious substances and that radiate variegated light. Whenever the god thinks, ‘I, of such and such a name, wish to travel through the sky,’ these boots will carry him wherever he pleases, and he will travel entirely free from any weariness or harm.

To the satisfaction and joy of everyone, the beauty and youthfulness of the goddesses is unprecedented, and even the quality of their garments will seem better than before. Because of their past positive acts, the gods emit a light that makes the bodies of the goddesses blossom to their fullest, just like the light of the rising sun opens all flowers and makes them bloom. Thus, as the light of the gods touches the goddesses, everyone smiles and indulges in joyous carousing. Placing the goddesses on their laps, the gods carry them gracefully away into the groves and parks.

In this way they continue to enjoy themselves until finally their positive karmic actions have been exhausted. Once that happens, they will die and leave their divine world. Tied by the chains of karmic action, they will be impelled by their own past actions to take birth among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. If, due to karmic actions to be experienced as a human, they should instead take birth among humans, they will, in accordance with their causal actions, enjoy perfect physiques, be born in excellent families, and possess outstanding qualities. They will have perfect happiness, provide for their own needs, be independent of others, and do as they please. They will be free from sickness, harm, or discomfort and enjoy tremendous wealth. {{page:{number:747,id:UT22084-068-021-100774,folio:F.138.a,volume:V69}}} They will be born during threefold endowment, or within a family of leaders, as someone in charge of half a country, as a regent, or as an exceedingly rich businessperson who possesses wealth, grain, gold, and silver in abundance.

He will then notice how a person who has apprehended a thief that could rightfully be punished may refrain from punishing or harming that thief due to fear of what lies beyond this world. With a wish to benefit others, and out of loving concern, such a person may also work to release thieves that are held by others, offering them a bed, bedding, medicine, and household articles and helping them attain what they need.

They will also physically express veneration for the gurus, rising quickly and bowing with respect. They will always speak pleasantly, and when they see unwholesome company they will not associate with such persons by having fun, walking, or conversing with them. They will also avoid enjoying themselves together with people whose minds are afflicted, who are not noble, and who are shunned by the world. Instead they will look straight ahead and refrain from not sitting down with such people. They will have proper regard for elders and respect them. They will have love for sentient beings and not cause pain to others. They will be praised by the whole world and themselves show respect for those who speak pleasantly {{page:{number:748,id:UT22084-068-021-100775,folio:F.138.b,volume:V69}}} and gently.

They will refrain from overeating and letting themselves go. They will refrain from living in a harmful way and avoid fits of agitation. They will avoid impure means of livelihood, such as butchery, business, hunting with dogs, trapping, and so on, and they will desist from trading and other forms of non-Dharma. They will have no interest in bars, and they will avoid dependency on women, unwholesome actions, and flawed conduct. They will avoid divulging the secrets of others, have no hidden ill will against friends, and avoid making enemies. They will refrain from spying on others and informing the authorities. They will refrain from taking produce from the fields of others, refrain from taxing a population at more than a sixth, and they will not confiscate the fields, water, or property of others. They will refrain from taking fruits that belong to others, whether by day or night, and they will be entirely, partially, or slightly free from the intention to steal.

It means to refrain from engagement in the preparatory stage of the act of stealing. Intermediate freedom from such action is to confess what was done, regard it as a mistake, and refrain from such actions in the future. Great freedom from the act of stealing is to avoid engagement in the preparatory stage of the act, prevent others from engaging in it, encourage others to confess such misdeeds, and avoid rejoicing in such acts while disassociating from its perpetrators. Based on the individual degrees of lesser, intermediate, or greater relinquishment of the intent to steal, there will, correspondingly, be lesser, intermediate, and greater effects.

Nevertheless, to provide some slight indication, think of the difference between being born in the Reviving Hell and being a universal monarch of the golden wheel, a human who experiences the pleasures of the gods and possesses all the seven precious substances that exist on the four continents. That may provide a slight indication about the gods of Dwelling in Forests.

The realm is adorned with glorious divine trees of the seven precious substances and features beautiful rivers. In the forest known as Action grow trees of gold. When the gods wish to go somewhere, they think, ‘Let the trees follow us!’ As soon as they develop such a wish, the gods of Dwelling in Forests will be followed by the trees wherever they may go. Just as, for example, the wheel of the universal monarch begins to travel through the sky as soon as the monarch wants it to, so the trees will journey through the sky whenever the gods want them to. They will also descend to the ground wherever the gods want them to. Thus, the trees will move from one place to the next, just as a flock of birds may fly to a place, stay there for some time, and then fly off to another. This is one of the powers of the gods of Dwelling in Forests, generated by their own karmic actions.

When, adorned with divine garlands and garments, the gods of Dwelling in Forests travel through the sky, the power of their positive actions will also make lotuses with beryl stalks appear. These lotuses have a thousand petals, and upon each of these lotuses is a goddess to whom the gods will flock. Once the gods in Dwelling in Forests thus reside within such divine lotuses, the power of their positive karmic actions will make vessels filled with divine beverages appear from the sky and pass into their hands. The gods and goddesses will then drink together and be happy, singing songs and cavorting until they decide to go somewhere else. The power of the positive actions of the gods in Dwelling in Forests also lets them obtain whatever they wish for. Whenever they wish to travel from one divine abode to another, the mountain or peak where they arrive will have divine flowers and fruits, perfect rivers, and exquisite groves and parks. All such things will manifest out of the sky. Together with the goddesses that surround them, the gods in this realm sing songs to the accompaniment of music of the five instruments as they travel through space from one place to the next.

Produced by positive karmic actions, Śakra’s delightful lotus flower is delightful in the following ways: upon each of its petals perch five goddesses adorned with divine garlands, garments, and gold ornaments. Playing the music of the five instruments, the goddesses are totally elated and ecstatic, all of them facing toward Śakra. All the goddesses are completely infatuated by their own exquisite forms and youthfulness. Thus, together with Śakra, all of these goddesses glide across the sky to the realm of Dwelling in Forests.

Descending from their abodes, as described before, they will come forth to welcome Śakra, king of the gods. Bowing their heads to the ground before him, they will offer him praises. The gods that serve Śakra and the inhabitants of Dwelling in Forests will then gather around Śakra in utter joy and accompany him across the sky as he travels to whichever pleasure garden, mountain peak, forest, grove, lotus pool, or other destination he may wish to visit. When the followers of Śakra have frolicked for a long time, they will return to their realm, coming back in the same way as they left. Śakra will then proceed to the divine assembly hall of Sudharma.

Wondering what karmic actions may cause beings to be born among the gods there, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing. He will then notice how an inappropriate king, an inappropriate minister, or other inappropriate people, who are filled with greed and have no fear of karmic action, may prevent the delivery of supplies to the site of a stūpa. However, a holy person who has trained his mind and thoughts may praise the buddhas either by recollecting their qualities or by chanting in an extremely beautiful and clear voice. By doing so, he may prevent this activity or cause such obstructors to be replaced. When such a holy person later separates from his body, he will go to the joyful higher realms and be born among the gods in Dwelling in Various Chariots. Once born there those who engaged in such exceptionally virtuous actions will enjoy themselves, rollick, and revel to the sound of music of the five instruments.

How does this relate to refraining from {{page:{number:753,id:UT22084-068-021-100780,folio:F.141.a,volume:V69}}} and relinquishing theft? This means to avoid punishing others when one has become the ruler, king, or minister of a given place, to cause others to give up such punishment, and to make others abide within what is right or the rule of law.

In the lotus pools grow flowers with colorful petals, such that some lotuses are half sapphire and half beryl. That is one colorful feature. Other flowers are half beryl and half gold. That is another colorful feature. Another is that some flowers have a hundred petals, half of which are golden and the other half the color of ruby. Another colorful feature is that around lotuses with ruby petals hover golden bees, and around lotuses with silver petals hover ruby bees. Another colorful feature is that lotus stalks of beryl are enveloped in gold, lotus stalks of gold are enveloped in precious substances, lotus stalks of silver are enveloped in coral, and emerald-colored stalks are enveloped in gold from the Jambu River. The lotus pools are studded with different kinds of colorful humming bees. Just as in Jambudvīpa {{page:{number:754,id:UT22084-068-021-100781,folio:F.141.b,volume:V69}}} where the anthers of certain flowers{{note:{index:291,id:UT22084-068-021-3078}}} always attract numerous bees, the same is the case with the flowers in Dwelling in Various Chariots.

Thus, some birds have yellow abdomens with silvery feathers, a ruby-colored back, and eyes the color of the karketana stone. Others have silvery abdomens with golden feathers, beryl-colored eyes with ruby pupils, and multicolored backs. Thus, birds in the colors of the seven precious substances embellish this forest.

Thus, three colors may appear when ruby fruits hang from twigs of beryl entwined in twigs of lapis lazuli. Likewise, there are silver twigs encircled by ruby light, twigs of coral and gold are interwoven with twigs of gold, and twigs with the color of karketana may become covered by twigs of silver. {{page:{number:755,id:UT22084-068-021-100782,folio:F.142.a,volume:V69}}} In such ways the twigs may appear in two colors as they intertwine. Other twigs are also of three colors, as beryl twigs may be covered by other twigs in the colors of gold and karketana.

Thus, he will make them think, ‘If I give to recipients such as mendicants or brahmins, then what shall my children and spouse eat or wear?’ In this way, that third ruler of the world will confuse sentient beings as he roams throughout the world. A fourth ruler of the world, who is of the class of the māras and is known as Misperception, will travel throughout the world and cause those who have gone forth to renege on their resolve. Thus, he will cause them to develop attachment, engage in mundane affairs, enter town, pursue selling and business, develop the desire to look at females, visit bars, fight, create divisions within the saṅgha, and suffer mental trauma due to dreams.

Our desirous attachments subdue them and prevent them from listening to the sacred Dharma. In the dreams of those who aroused the motivation to go forth—that is, those who actually went forth, in addition to householders who took vows and practiced pure conduct—we have conjured up appearances of women and in this way made them suffer those impediments resulting from dreams. We have created attachments in the minds of donors and benefactors who practice generosity, thus making their minds dependent on their children and wives. We have caused people to fight with their friends and caused those who have gone forth to pursue business. We have made people fond of strife, argument, and slander.

{{milestone:{label:4.B.673,id:UT22084-068-021-3102}}} “Each of the trees in that forest provides whatever the gods may wish for. Thus, if a god should think, ‘I would like a house,’ there will immediately appear a house on top of the canopy of the trees. The house that the trees thereby produce will be a thousand-pillared mansion adorned with the seven precious substances. Some of the pillars in the building will be made of beryl. Others will be of gold, crystal, karketana, or emerald. {{page:{number:761,id:UT22084-068-021-100788,folio:F.145.a,volume:V69}}} When seeing such a supreme mansion appear on top of the trees’ branches, the god will think, ‘I would like to enter that home by way of a smooth and even path.’ At that very moment, the trees will manifest a path and the god will set out upon it. While ascending along that passage, the god may think, ‘It would also be nice if there were a lotus pond within the building,’ and as soon as he has this thought, there will indeed appear such a pond, made of the seven precious substances and adorned with swans, ducks, and yellow geese. The god may then think, ‘Let there be music of the five instruments.’ As soon as he has entertained that thought, gentle fragrant breezes will stir and, as the breezes mingle, they will create the sound of music of the five instruments. At this point the god might think, ‘May food and drink flow like rivers within this home in the trees,’ and at that very moment the branches of the trees will open up, producing rivers of food and drink that are of exquisite colors, tastes, and textures. At this point, the god may think, ‘Now I would like to drink ambrosial elixir.’ In that very instant an ambrosial elixir having perfect taste, aroma, and color will manifest, and the god will drink it until he is completely satiated. He will then play and frolic with the goddesses. In this manner, the gods experience such enjoyments within that forest.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.674,id:UT22084-068-021-3103}}} “The gods may also at some point descend from those amazing trees to go for a stroll. In that case heavenly lotus flowers with beryl stalks and golden petals will appear. The flowers are soft, {{page:{number:762,id:UT22084-068-021-100789,folio:F.145.b,volume:V69}}} vibrant, delightful, and fragrant. Thus, as the gods go for their ramble, they will be stepping on those flowers, which in turn produce divine musical sounds of the five instruments. Thus, every step the gods take will be an experience of pleasure.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.675,id:UT22084-068-021-3104}}} “In this way hundreds of thousands of the gods’ ideas are realized and blissfully fulfilled as they experience the objects of the five senses. Even so, their senses are never satisfied by their objects. Any form the gods’ eyes may see will be registered as unique, opulent, and delightful. As soon as they open their eyes, they will apprehend and perceive further desirable, attractive, and delightful forms, and so they will never feel satisfied by the forms they see. All that they hear is also exceptionally delightful, and so their ears are likewise insatiable. As their noses register scents, all that they smell is desirable, attractive, and delightful, and thus the gods’ noses are never sated by any amount of aromas. When their tongues experience tastes, all are sensed as extremely pleasant and delicious. Their physical experience of textures is likewise an experience of desirable, attractive, and delightful objects. Similarly, all the things that they bear in mind are similarly desirable, attractive, and delightful.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.676,id:UT22084-068-021-3105}}} “Thus, with their six collections of craving consciousness and their desirous bodies, the gods laugh, enjoy, revel, and rollick within their forest without ever feeling satisfied. In this way, the wind of thought that stirs the faculties above wafts through the jungle of objects below, fanning the blazing fires of nonvirtue. Although this fire blazes every single day, the objects they crave never bring them any satisfaction.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.677,id:UT22084-068-021-3106}}} “While the gods play {{page:{number:763,id:UT22084-068-021-100790,folio:F.146.a,volume:V69}}} and joyfully amuse themselves with numerous objects in this way, Śakra, king of the gods, will upon his victory over the asuras pay a visit to various high mountains, as explained before. When he arrives, Śakra will call on the gods and tell them, ‘Gods, enjoy yourselves in this forest. Play with this wealth of divine sense pleasures! I have defeated the hordes of the māras, Vemacitrin, and the rest. Now I shall go to the forest, and I want all gods and goddesses to come and stay there with me during the four months of the monsoon. We shall certainly enjoy ourselves.’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.678,id:UT22084-068-021-3107}}} “When he has instructed the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three in this way, he will next call upon his elephant, Airāvaṇa: ‘Supreme elephant, get ready. I am going to the forest for the sake of enjoyment and celebration, and I shall be traveling in the company of all the gods and goddesses. Just as you have done before, you must create emanations so that everyone can ride on your back, head, tusks, and shoulders. You must create emanations of forests, lakes, mountains, peaks, groves, and parks.’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.679,id:UT22084-068-021-3108}}} “When he hears Śakra’s words, Airāvaṇa, the supreme elephant, will magnify himself, making his body very large. He will then emanate one hundred heads, each bearing ten white tusks. On each of the tusks lie ten lotus pools, each containing one thousand lotuses that have one thousand petals made of the seven precious substances. On each of the petals sit bees of the seven precious substances, and on each of these petals the gods and goddesses will take their places without any sense of feeling intimidated by one another. Thus, riding upon the heads of the supreme elephant, everyone will journey across the sky to the pleasure garden that is {{page:{number:764,id:UT22084-068-021-100791,folio:F.146.b,volume:V69}}} richly endowed with heavenly enjoyments of the five senses.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.680,id:UT22084-068-021-3109}}} “The elephant will emanate two forests on his shoulders, one known as Utter Joy and the other called Desirable. In each of them, there will be perfect trees, cascades, and ponds. There will be exquisite trees of the seven precious substances and perfect wish-fulfilling trees. Within those forests the gods will enjoy themselves and frolic about, and thus the groves will be filled with gods and goddesses who experience divine delights of the five senses. In this setting, Airāvaṇa, king of elephants, will proceed as if he were a second Mount Sumeru.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.681,id:UT22084-068-021-3110}}} “On the back of the supreme elephant lies a city called Even and Smooth Surface, which is like a second Sudarśana, complete with beautiful streets, crossroads and forks, parks, trees, and houses made of the seven precious substances. In its center stands a mansion adorned with a hundred pillars of the seven precious substances, and in the center of that building is a lake. Therein, the king of the gods will rollick with his bevy of goddesses. Śakra, king of the gods, will revel and frolic there to the accompaniment of music of the five instruments, all the while traveling to the forest.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.682,id:UT22084-068-021-3111}}} “Even though the gods are traveling, they do not notice any change. Just as they do not perceive that they are staying upon Mount Sumeru, they also do not feel any movement of the supreme elephant.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.683,id:UT22084-068-021-3112}}} “Upon his ears, the elephant will manifest two lotus pools, each of them measuring eleven leagues. One of them is called Deep and the other Bright, and these ponds are brimful of water endowed with the eight features. In the ponds grow water lilies with beryl petals and jewel stalks. Some are ruby colored and ornamented by bees, and they abound with blooms {{page:{number:765,id:UT22084-068-021-100792,folio:F.147.a,volume:V69}}} that are intensely fragrant. Upon the anthers of those lilies, the gods and goddesses take their places and frolic. Playing with the water and the lilies, they cannot tell whether the supreme elephant is moving or standing still.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.684,id:UT22084-068-021-3113}}} “Upon its trunk the elephant will emanate a long pool that measures five leagues and is surrounded by mansions with pillars topped by capitals. There are divine trees and the area is studded with mandārava flowers. Bees hum merrily and the place is adorned with the beautiful leaves of divine gośīrṣa sandalwood trees, trees of gold, and numerous other kinds of flowers. Upon the anthers of the flowers sit goddesses who play music, singing and chanting auspicious praises to the king of the gods. In this way, such an elongated pool will be emanated on the tip of the elephant’s trunk.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.685,id:UT22084-068-021-3114}}} “Upon the tip of his trunk, the elephant will emanate a large pool that measures about a league, and in that pool will be many hundreds of thousands of huge lotuses. The flowers are extremely fragrant, filling the atmosphere with divine aromas for a distance of ten leagues. Upon each petal of these beautiful great lotuses gather throngs of gods and goddesses who sing, frolic, and revel. When the gods thus rollick and are absorbed in their pleasures, they do not see each other, and they remain free from harm. The gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three also travel to the forest on the tip of the elephant’s trunk. As they journey upon Mount Sumeru, they do not notice that their destination is a creation of that supreme elephant.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.686,id:UT22084-068-021-3115}}} “Next, the supreme elephant will create upon his trunk a great mountain called Adorned with Springs. This mountain is adorned with various springs and beautiful heavenly trees, cascades, ponds, parks, {{page:{number:766,id:UT22084-068-021-100793,folio:F.147.b,volume:V69}}} lakes, and lotus pools. There, other gods will frolic, enjoy themselves, and have fun. Upon the head of the flower-decorated supreme elephant, another mountain will also be created.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.687,id:UT22084-068-021-3116}}} “The tusks of the supreme elephant resemble the waxing moon. Upon their tips the elephant will emanate parks with an even ground that is adorned with flowers and lakes. Among the beautiful flower petals bees buzz and the clear calls of cuckoos can be heard. On the dry land roam ravishing peacocks, pheasants, and the other divine birds that adorn the emanated parks that have been created upon the tusks.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.688,id:UT22084-068-021-3117}}} “Thus, when the supreme elephant has in this way extended his body size, he walks toward the pleasure gardens. Surrounded by the gatherings of gods, he ambles on without growing weary and with a gait of elegant majesty.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.689,id:UT22084-068-021-3118}}} “From his two nostrils, the supreme elephant sprays streams of water that flow like the rivers Gaṅgā and Yamunā in Jambudvīpa. The cool waters are extremely pure—free from any impurity whatsoever. To provide a slight analogy, when herbs, grass, forests, barley, and wheat suffer from heat and drought within the four human abodes, they can be revived by a rain that falls on the grains and leaves. In the same way, the nostrils of the king of elephants are always like that.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.690,id:UT22084-068-021-3119}}} “As the water flows, the wind will scatter it throughout the sky. The wind causes the water to evaporate over a great distance and thus the water appears as mist within the three abodes of humans. Moreover, when the supreme king of elephants trumpets, he releases water, which showers down among the gods who travel in the midst of the sky. This looks like a moving white light, and so when certain non-Buddhists see that, they will say, ‘That is the path of Indra,’ while others may call it ‘the path of the elephant Airāvaṇa.’ Yet they do not know that what they see is white water. {{page:{number:767,id:UT22084-068-021-100794,folio:F.148.a,volume:V69}}} Thus, as the water is scattered by the wind and suddenly falls, they see it like thirsting deer see mirages.

{{milestone:{label:4.B.691,id:UT22084-068-021-3121}}} “Next, the supreme king of elephants, who thus carries a mountain upon his head, will above the crown of his head create a supreme victory banner, a beryl ring, and a golden parasol that decorate him beautifully, as if he were a second sun. He will also carry a standard that measures one league and radiates white light. When the asuras who dwell in the sea see that light, they will tell each other, ‘The gods have arrived. That light shines from the standard called Victor, which belongs to Śakra, king of the gods.’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.692,id:UT22084-068-021-3122}}} “In this way the supreme king of elephants proceeds to the parks. When the gods see the forest in the distance, Śakra will tell them, ‘All of you, look at these great delights. Gods who defeated the asuras, for the four months of the monsoon you shall celebrate with the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three within this great forest that is so delightful to behold.’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.693,id:UT22084-068-021-3123}}} “When the gods hear those words, they will reply, ‘We shall do just as Śakra commands.’ Śakra’s elephant, Airāvaṇa, will then amble into the park, and all the gods will frolic, celebrate, and revel together with the divine inhabitants, who all possess heavenly pleasures of the five senses.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.694,id:UT22084-068-021-3124}}} “As the gods who live and play in the hills of the parks see the supreme standard and the king of elephants, Airāvaṇa, they will become overjoyed and proceed to receive Śakra, king of the gods. Joining their palms above their heads, they will venerate him {{page:{number:768,id:UT22084-068-021-100795,folio:F.148.b,volume:V69}}} and merrily entertain him with beautiful melodies, songs, and dances. Śakra, king of the gods, will then descend from his elephant and together with the gathering of gods proceed into the parks. The gods that journey upon Airāvaṇa’s head, tusks, and shoulders will likewise descend and enter the parks to play, enjoy themselves, and be happy. Thus, the inhabitants of the great forest and the gods who with Śakra were victorious over the asuras will together enjoy a wealth of pleasures of the five senses, experiencing indescribable enjoyment for the four months of the monsoon. Śakra, king of the gods, will be attended to by groups of gods and goddesses who in turn are attended to by other groups of gods and goddesses. In this way everyone will enjoy themselves and frolic.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.695,id:UT22084-068-021-3125}}} “Thus, these gods experience incomparable bliss, and they continue to enjoy themselves until finally their completed and accumulated acts have been exhausted. Once that happens, they will die and leave their divine forests. After their death they will, in accordance with their karmic actions, take birth among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. If, possessing the general lot in life of a human, they are born as humans, they will, in accordance with their causal actions, possess an immaculate, dexterous intelligence and a supremely attractive physical form. They will be extremely agreeable to everyone and be born where there are delightful waterfalls, mountains, ponds, and parks. In their environment there will be many people who are joyous, powerful, wealthy, and live happy lives.

Thus, he will wonder, ‘What actions might be the cause of the tremendous miraculous powers that allow this elephant to be victorious in the battle between the great gods and the asuras? And what might be the actions that caused him to be born as an animal?’

He practiced generosity, engaged in what is virtuous, and with steadfast regularity provided for the lowly, the unprotected, beggars, and those in pain. His mind was extremely virtuous, and he cared for the whole world.

On the journey, King Sudarśana was accompanied by eighty-four thousand elephants wearing golden nets and webs of bells, eighty-four thousand horses adorned with golden nets and strings of small bells, eighty-four thousand attending ladies, and eighty-four thousand musicians. The brahmin noticed King Sudarśana’s supreme pleasures and extreme wealth and, although he possessed perfect wealth himself, he decided to go to the palace where the king was partaking of his enjoyments.

The forest is square, and at its four sides stand four great wish-fulfilling trees of flawless beryl. The shining trees stand about a league tall, and their light reaches across five thousand leagues, shining just like the sun. On their branches and leaves gods play with retinues of goddesses, receiving whatever they may wish for from the branches and leaves. Encircled by those trees lies the forest of Beauty. It is adorned with lotus pools of gold, silver, and beryl; trees of refined gold; great unplowed fields that consistently yield produce that is in every respect flawless, clean, and delicious; and immaculately white birds that are agreeable to behold and delightful to hear.

Prepare yourselves, because the asuras on Moon Mountain are inflicting harm upon the gods.’ When they hear this command, the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three will go to the forest of Beauty. All the gathered gods and the divine officials of Śakra will then enter the forest. Upon the trunks of the four great, stainless, divine trees of beryl that grow in the four directions the gods will then see their forms reflected, as if in a mirror. They will behold the signs of their victory, but they will also see reflections that show how certain gods among them will have their limbs cut and severed in the upcoming battle between the gods and asuras. They will see how the gods that lose limbs in this way will grow new limbs back; this will not be the case, however, when the god has his neck cut and is decapitated. Those among them who are going to have their necks cut and their heads severed will see that reflected in the trees. When a god has seen that this is going to happen to him, he will then inform the others. {{page:{number:776,id:UT22084-068-021-100803,folio:F.152.b,volume:V69}}} To ensure that the death of that god will be avoided, the gods will notify Śakra, telling him that this god is going to die in the battle against the asuras.

In this analogy, the person who shakes the tree is very weak and the wood apples that fall are few and only slightly ripe. That is how people with tainted discipline will be born among the gods.

At this time, the powers of the asuras will grow and the powers of the gods will diminish. On this occasion, I shall enter the war between the gods and asuras. While I will have the power to prevail, other gods will not have such power. Keep this in mind. The gods must endeavor in the Dharma.

Thus, he will wonder, ‘What actions caused those colorful and diverse birds that sing in such myriad ways among the precious trees to enjoy themselves, rollick, and revel within those groves and parks?’ In this way the monk who has detailed knowledge of the nature of karmic actions will inquire into the effects of actions. As he examines the matter with knowledge derived from hearing, he will notice how a concentrated, professional painter can create fine and colorful paintings of bodies, pleasure gardens, or delightful groves. Thus, with blue, yellow, red, and various blended colors he may paint on a canvas, the walls of a temple, or a stūpa. By the blessings of the buddhas, such professional artists may paint trees, {{page:{number:780,id:UT22084-068-021-100807,folio:F.154.b,volume:V69}}} birds, people, tigers, horses, cities, forests, parks, pools, gardens, lotus groves, lakes, mendicants, brahmins, towns, markets, palaces, and so on. By the blessings of the buddhas and the Dharma, such professional craftspeople may also, in accordance with the instructions of their sponsors, paint various designs in fine colors upon even and polished surfaces of gold, silver, copper, and the like. When such people later separate from their bodies, they will go to the joyous higher realms and take birth among the gods as birds with the same appearance that they painted previously. Those among them who lacked discipline and engaged in various actions may be born as happy deer or bees. In such cases, although their karmic actions and the consequences thereof are comparable to those of the gods, when such silly people attentively engage in those actions, they will also be mindless in the heavens, experiencing happiness among the trees and mountain peaks within the delightful divine forests and parks. Those who crafted various images on duly prepared and polished surfaces of ivory, silver, gold, or the like, will, through their diverse actions, take birth with bodies shaped in a multitude of ways.

Wondering what karmic actions may cause beings to be born among the gods there, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing. He will then notice how some great and knowledgeable individuals provide their mothers and fathers with clothing, food, bedding, and medical supplies, just as they may encourage and establish others in such virtuous activity. While thus practicing generosity, they may also abstain from even the minutest aspects of killing. Thus, they may carefully refrain from eating overripe fruit that may contain worms, just as they may cause others to refrain from and disdain doing so. While observing discipline themselves, they may also cause others to do so. As for refraining from stealing, they will abstain from brazenly trespassing and taking fresh fruit and also refrain from taking fallen fruit in parks. They will also encourage others to exhibit such restraint and have disdain for such actions, and they will establish others on the path of virtuous actions. Such great individuals who benefit both themselves and others will, when separating from their bodies, {{page:{number:782,id:UT22084-068-021-100809,folio:F.155.b,volume:V69}}} go to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three and be born among the gods who dwell by the Pārijāta tree.

Whenever the humans in Jambudvīpa are righteous and follow the Dharma, this wish-fulfilling tree will bloom splendidly with radiant and fragrant flowers that can be sensed across a hundred leagues. At such times, the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three will be delighted. Surrounding the wish-fulfilling tree they will say, ‘Marvelous! The wish-granting Pārijāta tree is abloom. Without any doubt, the people of Jambudvīpa respect mendicants and brahmins, and they venerate and follow the elders of their families.

Some birds sing in infatuation as they frolic with their partners within the lotus groves studded with beautiful bees.

Their necks are adorned with flower garlands, {{page:{number:802,id:UT22084-068-021-100829,folio:F.165.b,volume:V69}}} and in the lotus pools they play with the swans. Some eat from heavenly fruits, and others pluck flowers from wish-fulfilling trees while singing the most amazing, divine songs. In these ways, they are, in numerous ways, stunningly attractive and totally captivating to the minds of all.

They rise from their seats and approach the goddesses, who are wonderfully youthful and draped with divine garlands and garments. As they move toward them, their minds are tormented by the fire of desire. As they approach the goddesses, the latter likewise rush forward to meet the gods.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.837,id:UT22084-068-021-3278}}} “Whenever a god dies, the goddesses leave him and instead find someone new, just like swarming bees that will look for new, fresh flowers whenever a flower withers. In this fashion, bearing garlands of various flowers, the bee-like goddesses, lovely and enamored, will approach the flowers of new gods and befriend them. They will then play amorously together, following their desires to which they have been accustomed since beginningless time. When a dying god sees how his goddesses leave him in favor of someone else, he will be completely grief-stricken. Like a hell being whose body burns in Ultimate Torment, the god who observes his loved ones opting for another will be mentally tortured by an incredible anguish that is akin to death.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.838,id:UT22084-068-021-3279}}} “Thus, the gods who die in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three will depart in a deranged and tortured state of jealousy and covetousness. Tormented by the prospects of their future existence, the gods exacerbate these extremely painful observations and thus work themselves into a tumultuous state of mind that prevents them from seeing anything else. Hence, once they are dead, they will be born among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. {{page:{number:803,id:UT22084-068-021-100830,folio:F.166.a,volume:V69}}} What is the karmic cause that produces such an experience? Breaking one’s vows in order to engage in an adulterous relationship with someone else’s wife. If, due to virtuous actions, one is born among the gods, the negative karmic condition of having stolen the wife of another may manifest in this way at the time of death. Thus, since a misdeed may ripen within an otherwise pleasant context, one ought to refrain from even minor misdeeds. As will be explained later, at the time of death the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife do not encounter any consequences of having broken the sevenfold discipline.

Some bees have beryl-colored bodies and golden wings, others have golden bodies and silvery wings, some have multicolored bodies, and still others have bodies of coral with chrysoberyl. Bees such as these frolic and revel among the ever-fresh lotus flowers. Just as the goddesses sing and play music in the most delightful way, so the bees hum beautifully within the dense lotus groves. The divine sons and daughters proceed to enter the pools and play together in the water—joking, frolicking, rollicking, and enjoying themselves.

Within their own groves of divinely fragrant pink and blue lotuses, gods and goddesses adorned with heavenly garlands, garments, silks, and ornaments of pure gold from the Jambu River enjoy the music of the five types of instruments as they playfully entertain each other. Others listen to the delightful calls of geese and ducks and rollick freely among flocks of peacocks and swans. Still others stay in palaces in the sky where they frolic with groups of goddesses. Resembling lanterns in the sky, they remain extremely attached to their divine music and let a rain of flowers fall as they blissfully enjoy this heavenly music. Other groups of gods are seen to befriend each other as they drink delicious wine and engage in joyful and pleasant conversation. In accordance with their causal actions, some groups of gods are seen to partake of an elixir that grants perfect pleasure and that is of exquisite color, taste, and scent. Other gods pluck heavenly flowers from divine trees of the seven precious substances and attach those precious flowers to their bodies. Other groups of gods pick fruits, tossing the fruits to each other and consuming them. Still other groups of gods mount heavenly geese with broad wings made of the seven precious substances.

Ever craving, their six collections of consciousness remain attached and thus these gods are encircled and scorched by the fire of craving. As an example, think of a man in the middle of the bush at noon during the hot season. Next, imagine that someone lights a fire and that the fire ignites the grass, petals, leaves, branches, trees, dried-out thickets and forests, rocks and cliffs. As the thirsting man in the middle of the wilderness thus finds himself surrounded by a bush fire, he will try to take off as best he can. Yet, wherever he tries to escape, he encounters only blazing heat and masses of fire, for the flames engulf the bush and consume all the vegetation. Thus, whichever path the man takes, he will see nothing but fire. If he steps into the flames, he will burn, yet he has nowhere to escape. Finally, he is forced to run directly into the flames and is burned alive in that very instant. {{page:{number:806,id:UT22084-068-021-100833,folio:F.167.b,volume:V69}}}

The fire of craving gains strength by the tremendous force of habitual patterning and is fanned by the wind of thinking. Hence, the fire of craving engulfs the wilderness of withered trees and dried bushes—the entire world, including all the attainments of concentration. In this example, the great fire alludes to the six collections of the craving consciousness, and the man’s attempt to flee illustrates the way the mind of the attached sense faculties adheres to its objects. As the wind of conceived objects creates distractions, the fire of craving for objects has the power to incinerate in an instant. Thus, the moment the gods enter that fire of craving for objects, they are destroyed. This is how an ordinary fire is used to illustrate the fire of craving.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.845,id:UT22084-068-021-3286}}} “In this way, the gods will enjoy their heavenly realm with its hundreds of thousands of features created by positive karmic actions. They will continue celebrating until finally their completed and accumulated acts with desirable, attractive, and delightful consequences have been exhausted. Once that happens, they will die and leave their divine world. In accordance with their actions, they will then be born among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. Should they instead be born with the general lot in life of humans, due to karmic actions to be experienced as a human, they will, in accordance with their causal actions, become kings or great ministers, residing in exquisite, jewel-studded palaces upon a ground of precious substances. They will enjoy constant happiness, be liked by royalty and commoners alike, and possess perfect offspring, wealth, and harvests.
The Gods in Engaging in Clarification

When some people notice how fresh leaves or a body of water contain tiny insects, they will refrain from eating or drinking directly therefrom. Instead, they will use a filter, and when they have filtered the insects out, they will not just discard them on dry land. Instead they will release them into some water where they can continue to live, and they may even look after them there. Additionally, they may cause others to do the same and thus establish them on the path of virtue.

Some people have no inclination to steal anything from other people’s sugarcane, amra fruits, lemons, jackfruits, or plantains.{{note:{index:295,id:UT22084-068-021-3291}}} Thus, they will not take even a single seed from there, as someone otherwise might have done in order to grow their own field or garden, or for the sake of enjoyment and pleasurable pursuits, or with a wish to earn a profit. Such people may also prevent others from such acts of stealing and instead establish them in the same practice and upon the path of virtue. In this way, such people adopt the discipline of benefiting both themselves and others by giving up killing and stealing.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.849,id:UT22084-068-021-3292}}} “There are also further aspects of pursuing and observing the discipline of refraining from killing and stealing.

They will therefore not apply any medical remedy that might have such an aftereffect, nor will they encourage anyone else to do so. Rather, although fearing for their life, they will not kill the parasites and thus practice benefiting both themselves and others.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.850,id:UT22084-068-021-3293}}} “How do they refrain from stealing? They refrain from even the subtlest form of stealing and instead practice generosity. What are the specific aspects of generosity? Some may have obtained a certain medicine to heal a disease from which they suffer. Yet, when seeing or hearing of someone else who suffers in the same way, they might think, ‘If I do not use this remedy for myself but give it away, that person can be cured.’ In such a situation, they will then give the medicine to the other person. When such genuine benefactors, who offer a gift aimed at the transcendence of suffering, later separate from their bodies, they will go to the joyous higher realms of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three and be born among the gods in the realm of Engaging in Clarification.

This realm is also adorned with another forest, known as Decorative Birds and Trees.

Similarly, the gods dwelling among the trees will also bring the trees with them as they fly in the sky. There are also lotus ponds for those who stay in this forest, and in those ponds grow various lotuses adorned with gold. The petals of the flowers are of beryl color, the stalks are golden, and the anthers are made of silver. Goddesses climb onto the lotuses and place themselves in the center of the flowers where they sing.

That mansion is made of water lilies and measures a hundred thousand leagues. Upon each of the petals stand various goddesses who sing and dance to the accompaniment of music of the five instruments. The light from the blue petals of the water lilies can turn everything blue, yet where the petals are red, the light that shines from them can make all the ornaments that are otherwise of many different colors turn red. Within these red and blue lotuses, upon the anthers that are produced from the roots and core of the flower appear many different goddesses. They surround the gods due to the latter’s former positive actions. Thus, on platforms upon the anthers stand goddesses who proffer many different lotuses as they sing, dance, play, and revel with the divine sons.

The joyful goddesses will carry on dancing, singing, laughing, and playing music of various kinds. Playing divine music with the five types of instruments, the joyous goddesses will then approach the gods who have previously engaged in wholesome conduct. As the gods see the celebrating young and nubile goddesses with their various attire and ornaments, their libidinous excitement will grow a hundred times more intense and along with other goddesses they will then rush toward them. As the goddesses who stay on the riverbank and the gods and goddesses who have come from the Water Lily Mansion thus mingle among each other, they will call out in laughter.

Without any kind of discord, they befriend each other, singing and laughing. They pass delicious wine around among one another and collectively partake of the wine, and they invite other groups of gods and goddesses to enjoy their nectar too.

In the rare event that karmic actions to be experienced as a human should make them take birth as humans, they will, in accordance with their causal actions, find constant happiness and be fond of bathing, ointments, and ornaments. They will also always be fond of pink, red, orange, and white lotus flowers. They will be honest and sincere by nature and will become very learned.

Some people may refrain from beating—and even protect—an enemy who has waged war and sought to kill them, murder their sons, and abduct their wives. Likewise, they may protect enemies who were apprehended by others. Thus, by speaking gently and offering valuable items, they may succeed in gaining the release of such enemies and subsequently do what they can to benefit them. Even if those evil people, who waged war but were freed, should continue to seek another’s death, the people in question will nonetheless spare their lives and even refrain from any animosity. In this way some people who have taken vows and are afraid of the effects of karmic actions may protect their enemies from the blows of sundry weapons. Out of fear of killing, they will refrain from striking their enemies, even at the cost of their own lives. Such are the aspects of freedom from killing that pertain to the present context.

In this way, they will also give up stealing. When such people, who have taken vows and are wary of even minuscule misdeeds, go to a temple or a park to study or to obtain water, they will abstain from using anything that has not been given to them by others, whether military boots, grass products, village produce, corn products, or cane products.{{note:{index:297,id:UT22084-068-021-3306}}} Frightened by the prospect of transgressing the commitments entailed by their training, they will abstain from willful stealing, whether by day or by night.

At that point one may wish, ‘May that carnivore not eat its own offspring! May it not succumb to starvation! I shall satisfy it with my own flesh.’ In this manner, one will go before the beast and let it eat one’s own body.

He himself will then be left to either starve day and night or eat only very little by scrounging for leftovers. Such a man may also cause others to relinquish killing and stealing. He may establish them on the path of virtue, causing them to rejoice in the performance of virtuous actions with tremendous delight.

Upon his arrival, light began to shine from his body, making it ten times more luminous than Mount Sumeru. Outshining all the gods, he thus remained in a sphere of light. Gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings noticed this and came before him with offerings and water to wash his feet. The gods said to him, “Your Majesty, please come with us. We have come here for your sake. You are worthy of our offerings.”

The light of this royal being comes from the splendor of his chariot, his wheel, and his body. The light does not come from any asura, nor does it belong to any terrestrial being.

Thereby, he will travel through the sky, followed by musicians, all the way to Sudarśana, the assembly hall of the gods. Other gods will remain in Pleasure Grove Park, rollicking and reveling in their wealth of the five senses until finally their completed and accumulated acts with desirable, attractive, and delightful consequences have been exhausted. Once that happens, they will proceed to take birth among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. Should they instead be born with the general lot in life of humans, in accordance with their causal actions they will not be born at a time of strife, but during the age of perfection. They will take birth in an extremely delightful place replete with forests and parks, and ripe with fruits, rice, barley, wheat, and sugarcane—a densely populated place where people are righteous. There, they will become kings or ministers who are liked by everyone, who possess an excellent body with all faculties intact, and who are blessed with sons and grandsons.

They will refrain from killing in such a way that they do not catch and seize live crocodiles or alligators on the riverbanks in order to eat them, nor do they kill them for the sake of profit. With respect to others who kill, they will establish them in such discipline. Thus, without rejoicing in any act of killing, they instead prevent such acts and establish others on the path of goodness. Such are the relevant features of giving up killing.

Virtuous people who are honest, are sincere, have taken vows, and are free from desirous thoughts may, out of consideration for their vows, refrain from smelling the scent of an incense that has been offered to the members of the saṅgha or at a stūpa. They will thus refrain from exposing their garments to the incense and avoid sensing it, and when their olfactory organs register the scent, they will not indulge in it. Such are the relevant features. Moreover, such people will refrain from even extremely minor acts of stealing, just as they will make others disengage from such acts, establishing them on the path of virtue and ensuring that they continue to abide on the path of goodness.

In that divine realm grows a tree called Shaded by Garlands. The delicious scent of its flowers can be sensed at a league’s distance, and within that distance it also causes the flowers of other trees to open and release their sweet fragrances. The tree’s flowers remain delightful for a long time, and each flower produces a garland that the gods can wear upon their heads. These garlands have numerous colors, including flowers that are blue, yellow, maroon, and white. Thus, the trees produce exquisite garlands in the same way that an expert artist, who is perfectly trained and accomplished, may paint them in the world of humans. Such are the wonders that emerge from these trees.

When yellow ducks see this, they call out and come flying to the pond. Thereby, gods and goddesses will know what is happening at the pond and proceed to travel there as well, singing and dancing all the way with great joy. The sound of their music will also cause other gods to abandon their fun and instead join the traveling gods as they come to frolic where the birds have gathered.

Various goddesses live in the forest and add to its beauty, and joyous gods come play and frolic there. Extremely blissful, they wear divine ornaments and their skin is moistened with divine sandal oil. No one causes anyone harm, and everyone enjoys each other’s company without the least displeasure in their hearts. Free from any weariness caused by envy or dispute, they experience the results of their own past actions. Endowed with diverse karmic actions they frolic and enjoy themselves within these heavenly lands, directly experiencing the results of their own actions.

The petals, colors, fragrances, and tastes of the white lotuses there are exquisite, and the flowers yield a delicious wine that flows like the wine served at a great banquet. The white lotuses produce a wine that is of similar color, taste, and fragrance. Likewise, the golden-colored lotuses produce golden wine, the beryl-colored lotuses produce beryl wine, the crystal-colored lotuses produce crystalline wine, and the lotus flowers that are emerald- and coral-colored produce wine of those colors. Multicolored lotuses with golden petals and beryl stalks yield various types of wine that flow from their vajra sprouts and anthers.

Just as the fire that consumes ritual offerings is never sated, these gods will never tire of the stream of objects that consist of delightful sounds, tastes, forms, and fragrances. In this way they go on rollicking and reveling until finally their completed and accumulated acts have been crushed and relinquished.

Should they instead be born as humans due to karmic actions to be experienced in other lives, they will, in accordance with their causal actions, always be extremely happy. Their bodies will be draped with flower garlands and moistened with ointments. They will enjoy constant and tremendous happiness, be eminently wealthy, and become kings or great ministers.

The Gods in Moving on Springy Ground

Wondering what karmic actions may cause beings to be born there, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing. He will then notice how some people who give up killing and stealing will abstain from making a living by killing snakes and splitting their heads to extract the jewels inside their heads. Such people will therefore never kill a snake with the intention of making a profit from the jewel in its head. They will also refrain from killing ants, or the like. Rather, recognizing that animals are sentient beings, they will refrain from killing them. Such are the specific features of giving up killing.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.901,id:UT22084-068-021-3352}}} “What are the relevant aspects of not stealing? They are to refrain from even the most minuscule acts of stealing, including taking even grass or stones without permission. Similarly, whereas others may purposely steal a book or the like in order to study the scriptures, these people will refrain even from that.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.902,id:UT22084-068-021-3353}}} “In what way do such people practice generosity? Even though they may make their living under great hardship, they will not be stingy with their possessions and so offer garments, food, bedding, and medical articles to those who have attained the first concentration. Likewise, they will offer alms and help maintain the locations where the saṅgha resides, thus sharing their possessions equally with the saṅgha. In this way they enjoy being open handed themselves, and they also establish others on the same path of virtue. When such virtuous people, who turn back what is unwholesome and who benefit others, later separate from their bodies, they will go to the joyous higher realms and be born among the gods in Moving on Springy Ground within the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. {{page:{number:824,id:UT22084-068-021-100851,folio:F.176.b,volume:V69}}}

The ground is pliant, slightly giving way when stepped upon yet resuming its original shape when the foot is lifted. For example, just as water forms waves when stirred by the wind, only to settle again when the wind ceases, so the ground in that realm is springy.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.904,id:UT22084-068-021-3355}}} “This is also a completely stainless realm. Like a perfectly clear mirror reflecting what is placed in front of it, the ground reflects the bodies of the gods. Another marvelous feature of this divine realm is that whenever the gods there think of other gods, or wish to go to another god realm, they miraculously obtain all the relevant information, as if written in a letter, and so are able to revel with the respective goddesses, just as they are able to enjoy all the other amazing features those realms may contain. Such are the joys of the gods of Moving on Springy Ground within the Heaven of the Thirty-Three.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.905,id:UT22084-068-021-3356}}} “The gods in this realm also engage in games in their forests, traveling between the various forests for the sake of enjoyment. The great forest known as Grove of Delicious Wine is draped with nets of tinkling bells of various sizes. It features numerous gorgeous trees that grow flowers and fruits and are home to many species of birds. When the gods sport within this forest to the accompaniment of music of the five types of instruments, they experience karmic consequences that take the form of extremely delightful sense objects.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.906,id:UT22084-068-021-3357}}} “That god realm also features a Forest of Palaces, which is always transforming.

That forest is made of the seven precious substances, and its beautiful trees, studded with numerous flowers and fruits, shine like the rising sun, . The trees are further adorned by songbirds that play among the leaves and fill the forest with their melodies. Within that delightful forest the gods, who are so attached to the six objects, will enjoy themselves with raging passion, sporting and reveling in their pleasures.

They will travel to this mountain peak, which has a height of ten leagues, accompanied by lovely goddesses who wear beautiful jewelry and attire. Upon this mountain is a pond called Beauty, which features flowers of the seven precious substances and is carpeted with blue, red, and pink water lilies. Its water is pristine and geese and yellow ducks call out there. The pond is surrounded by mansions with ornamental pillars of the seven precious substances, as well as by parks and groves. On the banks of this pond, which is surrounded by such beautiful sights, the gods and their attending goddesses will dance, flirt, and frolic. They will enjoy divine drink that is free from the detrimental side effects of intoxication, and partake of delicious fruits endowed with the six desirable tastes. Those fruits contain wine, which the gods will drink in the company of goddesses who wear various ornaments and garments. Elsewhere, goddesses will joyously sing, laugh, and play vīṇās, flutes, and drums with great mastery.

Thus, the more they have previously engaged in such actions, the more mentally delightful will be the observations they experience through their eye consciousness. That is to say, those gods whose engagement in virtue was of an inferior kind will, accordingly, not perceive more than the mere form of the object observed. Those whose virtuous conduct was of medium caliber will, on the other hand, see the given beautiful form and thereby experience a medium level of mental pleasure. Finally, those who accomplished superior deeds see bodies, sizes, colors, shapes, and forms that are all extremely appealing. This goes for all the observations of form, smell, and texture that are had by the gods at the different levels of the desire realm. Within the larger class of gods, the present subclass of gods only forms a single, general category. Thus, when seen as a single class of gods, one does not classify them in terms of three distinct kinds of ripening. At the same time, just as there are three levels of mental pleasure, it should likewise be understood that differing qualities of past karmic action shape the exquisite forms of the goddesses, as well as their ornaments and attire, in different ways.

Similarly, the textures that they touch are all desirable, attractive, and delightful, and the same goes for the mental phenomena they cognize: all are desirable, attractive, and delightful.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.933,id:UT22084-068-021-3385}}} “Thus, careless and attached to their divine objects, the minds of the gods remain unobscured, and so they continue to enjoy their pleasures, possessions, and enjoyments until finally their completed and accumulated acts with desirable, attractive, and delightful consequences have been exhausted. Once that happens, they will die and leave their divine world. In accordance with their karmic actions they will then take birth among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. Should they instead be born, in accordance with their karmic actions, with the general lot in life of a human, they will, in accordance with those causal actions, find constant and tremendous happiness, and they will delight in flower garlands, colored powders, and ointments. They will be honest, wealthy, happy, and appreciated by all beings. Their physiques will be exquisite, and everyone will hold them in highest regard. They will have lovely sons and wives and maintain conduct that is free from defects. Their wealth will never be destroyed due to the terrors of the rulers, water, or fire, and they will be born as princes or members of an influential family.
The Gods in Distinguished in Many Colorful Ways
{{milestone:{label:4.B.934,id:UT22084-068-021-3387}}} “As the monk who has knowledge of the effects of the ripening of karmic actions continues to concern himself with the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing and so correctly perceive a god realm known as Distinguished in Many Colorful Ways. Wondering what karmic actions may cause beings to be born there, {{page:{number:830,id:UT22084-068-021-100857,folio:F.179.b,volume:V69}}} he will apply knowledge derived from hearing. Thus, he will notice how some virtuous people with virtuous intent may give up killing and stealing while also encouraging others to do the same, thus establishing them on the path of virtue.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.935,id:UT22084-068-021-3388}}} “What are the specific features of having given up killing? Such people refrain from harming anyone under any circumstances—they do not encourage others to do harm, and they will not rejoice in any harm done. They do not enjoy themselves in the company of people who kill; they do not mingle with such people, nor do they even speak with them. They do not engage in afflictive conversation, and even when traveling they will not keep company with people who engage in unwholesome acts.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.936,id:UT22084-068-021-3389}}} “How do they refrain from killing? Such people refrain from deceitfully killing, or causing others to kill, deer or birds by means of song, music, or the sound of vīṇās, drums, or flutes. In the same way, they will also not kill any animals and birds that live in mountain pastures. Leaving all of this behind, they will instead free such animals and repudiate the hunters, causing them to give up any such activity, including even the mere thought. Such are the features of having given up killing.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.937,id:UT22084-068-021-3390}}} “What are the relevant features of not stealing? Some unrighteous merchants who do not follow the Dharma may use false measures, thereby stealing from their customers by hoodwinking them. How does such deception take place, and what are its features? People may pour sand onto the lever of a pair of scales, thereby using the sand to deceive, and thus fooling others who do not notice the problem. Later, such people may, however, regret such deceptive practices and instead tell themselves, ‘I shall never again take what was not given—not for my own sake, nor for that of my children or wife. I shall not do so for the sake of profit, nor for the sake of any unwholesome company. Let me not fall into the worlds of starving spirits or animals! That ripening is unbearable. The ripening of stealing is unbearable!’ Thus, they may thereafter refrain from taking what was not given, relinquishing even the conditions for stealing. {{page:{number:831,id:UT22084-068-021-100858,folio:F.180.a,volume:V69}}} Similarly, they may also cause others to refrain from such actions and give up rejoicing in them and so establish others on the path of virtue. In this way such people benefit both themselves and others.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.938,id:UT22084-068-021-3391}}} “In what way do they delight in generosity? They consider the helplessness, afflictions, and pain of those who lack both causes and effects, and who must earn a living by crossing the sea or desolate lands, or undergo other such challenges. To those they make donations respectfully and attentively. They also give to those who have attained the second concentration and to those who suffer. Those are the ways in which such people delight in generosity.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.939,id:UT22084-068-021-3392}}} “How do they grant life to living beings? When fishermen or bird trappers sell the animals they have caught, these people will ransom and release them. With delighted minds and senses, they will proceed to take them back to the waters they came from and let them go. They will also cause others to do the same, making them rejoice in such actions and engage in what is virtuous. In doing so they think, ‘Ah, wonderful, I have done well. I shall do so again and urge others to do so as well.’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.940,id:UT22084-068-021-3393}}} “Thus, throughout the preparation, the actual activity, and the conclusion, they benefit both themselves and others and give up killing and stealing. Time and again, they avoid stealing so that they may benefit others, save their lives, and give them the gift of life. Rejoicing in the generosity of both themselves and others, they observe a twofold discipline that is concerned both with themselves and others. When such disciplined people, who know what to do and what to avoid doing, and who benefit both themselves and others, later separate from their bodies, they will, after their death, go to the joyous higher realms {{page:{number:832,id:UT22084-068-021-100859,folio:F.180.b,volume:V69}}} and be born in Distinguished in Many Colorful Ways within the Heaven of the Thirty-Three.

As soon as they are born there, light will shine forth from their bodies, and from that light will appear numerous shapes, colors, and garments. Thus, the gods in this realm are provided with divine garments, ointments, and bodily ornaments. When this occurs as the god is born within that realm, he will first wonder, ‘What karmic actions have made me take birth here?’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.942,id:UT22084-068-021-3395}}} “At that point, he will remember his previous deeds and think, ‘Ah, how wondrous, I am here as the effect of wholesome actions. Amazing, these are the consequences of positive actions! I was born here because of positive actions.’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.943,id:UT22084-068-021-3396}}} “Next, because of his past positive actions, he will first hear the sound of music from the five types of instruments. Then, from all directions, he will hear the songs of desirous and joyous goddesses. Their beautiful singing pervades the entire realm, including the mountain peaks and caves, and causes the deer and birds to dance in infatuation. Listening attentively to their songs, the god’s excitement increases a hundredfold, and in this way the god’s mind is first distracted by the sound of songs. Later, when he sees the forms of the goddesses, a ravenous lust will be born in him. Thus, with his mind distracted by numerous qualities, he will notice that the goddesses, the mere sight of whom is gratifying, are coming toward him. Adorned with numerous forms, garments, and ornaments, their bodies and costumes surpass any example.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.944,id:UT22084-068-021-3397}}} “With tremendous desire, the god will now think, ‘Who are they? To whom do they belong?’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.945,id:UT22084-068-021-9947}}} “As soon as he has that thought the goddesses will utter this verse:
“ ‘We are the supreme cause
For all sorts of passionate desires. {{page:{number:833,id:UT22084-068-021-100860,folio:F.181.a,volume:V69}}}
And, god, we are yours,
So please come, revel in passion!’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.946,id:UT22084-068-021-3400}}}“With these verses in mind, the god will admire all their myriad delightful features. Turning eagerly toward the goddesses, he yearns to see more of them and touch them, and thus he will, in that moment, draw closer to them.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.947,id:UT22084-068-021-3401}}} “At that point, a third cause of desire occurs, because the mind depends on the senses and this dependency, in turn, requires that the mind engages with objects. With a desirous mind, the god will therefore follow through on his wish to touch the goddesses, and they, for their part, will also touch him with intense desire. Hence, there manifests a third cause of desire.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.948,id:UT22084-068-021-3402}}} “When the god senses the incomparable fragrance of the goddesses, he will wonder, ‘Whose is this beautiful, extremely attractive aroma that catches my nose?’ Thinking this, he senses the unparalleled fragrance of the goddesses who embrace him. Examining this fragrance that defies all examples, he will realize that it is the scent of the goddesses, and so he is moved by this fourth cause of desire.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.949,id:UT22084-068-021-3403}}} “Being already deeply attached to these four objects, the god will next be offered delicious wines and divine ambrosia by the goddesses. This establishes a fifth cause of desire. Thus, five causes of intense desire and attachment arise from the very outset.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.950,id:UT22084-068-021-3404}}} “As an effect of their unwholesome karmic actions, the gods who pursue desire do not initially notice that their minds have become attached to the pleasures of the objects. Subsequently, they will experience intense, lustful desire, and with such passion in their hearts, they will approach the goddesses. Meanwhile, the goddesses will approach the divine sons too, playfully flirting in joyous abandon.

Endowed with diverse and exquisite physiques and garments, these nubile goddesses will then proceed toward the groves, forests, ponds, waterfalls, and lotus groves. Accompanied by the gods, the goddesses will proceed to a forest known as Universal Delight. There, they will join the gods who live in that forest, and so enjoy themselves within its pleasure groves.

Some of the trees have golden trunks that support silver foliage upon branches of chrysoberyl. Those trees yield a pearl-like fruit of exquisite taste and form. Thus, the forest is adorned with indescribably gorgeous trees. The forest is also adorned with beryl trees that bear golden leaves, flower petals of chrysoberyl, and fruits the color of silver and coral. Likewise, there are lush trees that have trunks consisting entirely of the seven precious substances. Some of these trunks are wholly of gold, whereas others are of chrysoberyl, silver, or coral. Moreover, their branches and twigs are of the seven precious substances, and exquisite, divine flowers and fruits adorn them. The flowers of these trees display a wide spectrum of colors and produce a variety of delicious scents that can be sensed for a distance of six leagues. Multicolored bees swarm around them, crazed by the tastes of the flowers. Thus, previous wholesome karmic actions of various sorts cause the trees of Universal Delight, with their beautiful features, to manifest. {{page:{number:835,id:UT22084-068-021-100862,folio:F.182.a,volume:V69}}}

The trees of that forest have beryl trunks and bear flowers with golden petals and anthers of chrysoberyl. Bees the color of lapis lazuli swarm around the trees. Hearing the humming of the bees fills the gods with tremendous pleasure, and thus they come to feel exceptionally happy. This forest is radiantly beautiful for it is decorated by numerous colors, such as blue, yellow, and madder. Like the most delightful places in Jambudvīpa, this beautiful, shining forest features ornamental embankments, ponds, flower beds, and lotus petals that make it alluring in all regards.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.954,id:UT22084-068-021-3408}}} “Seeing that this forest has such delightful qualities and finding it to be a fine site for divine recreation, the elated gods will arrive flying through the sky, delightfully accompanied by throngs of goddesses. When the gods who normally stay in the forest see the approaching visitors, they will think, ‘They have come to see us!’ and so they will come forth to receive the approaching gods. Everyone will call out delighted greetings and they will befriend one another. With their fondness for lotus gardens, they will then frolic and revel in this grove to the accompaniment of music from the five types of instruments.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.955,id:UT22084-068-021-3409}}} “When the gods have spent a long time enjoying the sense pleasures within the forest of Universal Delight, they will proceed to a park known as Intoxicating Abode, which is rich in sense pleasures. Surrounded by various platforms, this pleasure grove features delightful pools, cascades, and elongated ponds. Studded with mansions that are made of the seven precious substances and decorated with gold, this forest features numerous distinct and delightful landscapes. {{page:{number:836,id:UT22084-068-021-100863,folio:F.182.b,volume:V69}}} Flocks of birds sing and dance in enchanting ways, and the sweet sound of cascading water and flowing streams can always be heard. Food and drink of the most exquisite color, taste, and fragrance flow like rivers. Once they have arrived there, the gods, who thus experience the effects of their own past actions, playfully enjoy the pleasures of the five senses, and they are accompanied by coteries of goddesses wearing various stunning garments and ornaments.

Hence, while they remain attached to the five types of objects and are absorbed in their pleasures, their respective positive actions are gradually exhausted, and once their past karmic actions have dissipated, they die. The gods are nonetheless careless and deceived by craving. They are spurred on by their craving and tormented by the fire of desire. In this fashion, maddened by their experience of bliss, their intoxicated minds do not notice what is happening. It is only when they have to give up the whole foundation for all their blissful play that they will finally perceive the impermanence of their great city of perishing. When they see accurately and with certainty that their own death is impending, they will indeed encounter great misery. Yet, it is only then that the gods comprehend this.

Once that happens, they will die and leave their divine world, only to take birth among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals, in accordance with their karmic actions. Should they instead be born human due to karmic actions that are certain to be experienced as a human, they will, in accordance with their causal actions, enjoy tremendous pleasures and possess perfect wealth and grain crops. {{page:{number:837,id:UT22084-068-021-100864,folio:F.183.a,volume:V69}}} They will have an honest and sincere nature and be born in a central region, knowing how to distinguish between good and bad actions, and what is right and wrong. They will be born in a great society where the ruler is righteous and follows the Dharma, where the people of the world conduct themselves in an irreproachable way, where everyone has happy eyes, and where even infants and old people are happy. Their bodies will be free from ailments and they will possess fine physiques and be strong. They will have nothing whatsoever to fear but will be supported by everyone. They will have sons and spouses and will attain whatever they wish for. Their wealth will be secured, and they will not have to fear or worry about the king, water, fire, robbers, or thieves.
The Gods in Promotion
{{milestone:{label:4.B.958,id:UT22084-068-021-3413}}}“As the monk who has knowledge of the effects of the ripening of karmic actions continues to concern himself with the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing and so correctly perceive a god realm known as Promotion. Wondering what karmic actions may cause beings to be born there, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing, and thus he will notice how some virtuous people possess the unmistaken view and are continuously aware of the reality of the effects of karmic action. They constantly contemplate the true view, remain honest, and refrain from harming others. They are always respectful to their parents, they are committed and joyous with respect to the Dharma, and they revere the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha. Such people may refrain from killing and stealing. Also, they avoid rejoicing in such acts and cause others to refrain from them as well. They do not encourage others to engage in such actions, but reproach those who do, informing them about the consequences of karmic actions. Teaching others the way things really are, they offer praise to those whose actions are wholesome, establish them on the path of virtue, {{page:{number:838,id:UT22084-068-021-100865,folio:F.183.b,volume:V69}}} and encourage them to continue in the same way. Having themselves given up killing and stealing, they cause others to do the same. By means of this twofold path of wholesome action, they cause people who have not yet taken vows to do so, and they cause those who have already taken them to observe their vows well. Those who thus benefit both themselves and others through wholesome actions will be born in the higher realms.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.959,id:UT22084-068-021-3414}}} “What are the relevant aspects of giving up killing in this context? They consist in disengaging from the unwholesome act of killing. What are the categories of this? Knowing other sentient beings to be sentient beings, such people do not take the lives of small worms, ants, or the like. How do they prevent killing? They stop those who cunningly catch mice, lizards, kites, or deer. The types of ruses that are used include traps, pits, mats of grass, nooses, ropes, ditches, and snares. Such people will prevent killing by such means. They do not rejoice in trapping, nor do they encourage others to engage in any such action. Instead, they instruct others not to kill living beings and establish them upon the path of the Dharma. In this way they cause others who are attached to killing to stop doing so.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.960,id:UT22084-068-021-3415}}} “How do such people refrain from stealing? Such people do not intentionally steal, not even mere grass, just as they cause others to refrain from doing so. What types of stealing are implied here? They consist in delighting in those who take what was not given. Here this refers to people who play music, dance, sing, celebrate, flirt, frolic, and revel with great pleasure in the company of females near a stūpa. {{page:{number:839,id:UT22084-068-021-100866,folio:F.184.a,volume:V69}}} Such unrighteous people may make their living in a park that has been given to the saṅgha, or a protected area, or by playing music, or from a stūpa site. One might also take from such musicians, or otherwise steal from them, or in other ways take what was not given. In terms of wages, this can also mean stealing the wages of women. That is to say, one may hire a woman in order to have intercourse with her, yet subsequently not pay her as previously agreed. Another form of stealing occurs when someone does not pay a fisherman, hunter, or butcher as agreed. If the promise of a fee leads to killing and stealing, people of this kind will refrain from such actions, not rejoice in them, and not even think of them.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.961,id:UT22084-068-021-3416}}} “How do they practice generosity? Even if they otherwise struggle hard to maintain a livelihood, such people will give donations to individuals who have attained the third concentration, or to other people, and they will do what is virtuous. Thus, even if they become impoverished themselves, they will continue being open handed to others, and they will even give more sincerely to others than to their own children. Such are the ways in which they practice generosity.

When animals are being killed during the sweeping of gutters, such people will interfere. They will splash water on the animals and place those that were discarded on dry land back into the gutter.

Those enjoyments cannot match even a sixteenth of the divine pleasures that are experienced by the gods occupying these heavenly seats. The gods in this realm have no flesh, bone, or lymph; they are free from miserliness; their eyes do not blink; their clothing is free from dust; they do not become affected by smoke or haze; they do not defecate or urinate; and they glow with a natural light. All these features are unlike those of the universal monarch. They have no attachment to spouses or children, are free from envy, do not eat or drink, and are not subject to sleep or laziness. Again, all these features are unlike those of a universal monarch. Thus, a universal monarch does not equal even as much as one sixteenth of these gods. Nevertheless, here a bit of illustration has been provided by means of something intelligible to humans.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.964,id:UT22084-068-021-3419}}} “The gods in this realm frolic and enjoy their rich sense pleasures. In their realm lies a forest called Kābīra, which is ten leagues long and five leagues wide. The forest is filled with many kinds of golden birds and colorful ornamental spheres. It is studded with fine and exceptionally beautiful flowers, and in its gorgeous trees of the seven precious substances live birds of striking beauty. The beautiful forests and trees of these gods, as well as the divine birds of numerous shapes and colors, can be compared to, for example, the beautiful jewelry and ornaments that a goldsmith might create to ornament humans. This might give a slight indication.

Some among the petals are intensely red like rubies, and the flowers emit an extremely delicious fragrance that can be sensed across a hundred leagues once the flowers open. The gods who sense this lotus fragrance are made ten times more crazed than they already are. Thus, together with their circles of goddesses, the gods will enjoy themselves and frolic within the Kābīra forest.

Others will be carried by ducks, pigeons, cranes, or grouses, and still others will be carried simultaneously by a variety of birds. Thus, residing upon such divine attributes, the gods who experience the consequences of past positive actions journey within the Kābīra forest to the place where food and drink flow like rivers. Infatuated, they travel for sport together with the goddesses to the place where food and drink flow like rivers. Upon their arrival at this land of food and drink, they will imbibe, enjoy themselves, and celebrate amid the sound of song and music of the five types of instruments. Thus, immersed in their blissful revelries, the gods will spend a great deal of time without noticing it elapse.

Those gods live on a face of Mount Sumeru that is adorned with forests and parks, studded with stone slabs of pure gold, and filled with waterfalls, rivers, embankments, ponds, and food and drink that flow like rivers. Their realm is teeming with goddesses beyond number, and this world is inhabited by beings in accordance with their respective karmic actions. Encircled by sixty thousand mountains, this great, lofty massif supports gods, asuras, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas.

They also see how the gods in that place have apparel, bodies, foods, and homes that are of three different qualities. The visitors will think, ‘It is not only we who have pleasures. Other gods live extremely enjoyable lives too, rollicking and reveling with hosts of goddesses.’ Thus, the visitors will see the many different gods, their wish-fulfilling trees adorned with numerous exquisite colors, tastes, forms and aromas, and their many forests and parks.

There they will proceed to dance, laugh, and celebrate to the tunes of the five types of instruments. Driven wild by their many blissful experiences, they develop sundry attachments in which they take pleasure. Among the groves, forests, and ponds, they thus revel in their rich enjoyments of the five senses, and although much time passes they are unaware of it.

Mount Universal Joy is speckled with many different jewels and adorned with embankments, parks, and ponds. It features embankments with a hundred thousand steps and hundreds of lotus pools. Various wellsprings adorn the mountain, as does a glow shining from the seven precious substances. There, among the radiant wish-fulfilling trees, the gods will frolic and celebrate. Infatuated by the sounds of gongs, drums, cymbals, flutes, and singing, the gods then befriend each other and so, {{page:{number:844,id:UT22084-068-021-100871,folio:F.186.b,volume:V69}}} in playful indulgence, experience the effects of their own past actions. Although they keep reveling for a long time, they remain careless and do not notice the passage of time. Enchanted by their objects, they remain insatiable, and, deluded by their intensely enjoyable pleasures, they thus proceed to Kubala Grove.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.974,id:UT22084-068-021-3429}}} “The lotuses in Kubala Grove are in full bloom, and hundreds of thousands of bees swarm among them. Accompanied by the bees, the gods will drink wine there and sing in insatiable sensuous enjoyment. With unquenchable lust, despite their hundreds and thousands of pleasures, they take up various musical instruments and remain in a state of constant inebriation.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.975,id:UT22084-068-021-3430}}} “In pursuit of various forms of common excitement, the gods will then proceed to the great park called Definite Attainment of Pleasure. There, the insatiable gods will remain frolicking and carelessly absorbed in their celebrations until finally their completed and accumulated acts with desirable, attractive, and delightful consequences have been exhausted. Once that happens, they will die and leave their divine world, only to take birth among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals in accordance with their karmic actions. Should they instead be born as humans due to karmic actions to be experienced in other lives, they will, in accordance with their causal actions, remain free from disease and have excellent complexions. They will not be hurt by royal functionaries, nor by business magnates or householders. They will enjoy tremendous happiness and possess keen and lucid intellects.
The Gods in Subtle Engagement
{{milestone:{label:4.B.976,id:UT22084-068-021-3432}}}“As the monk who has knowledge of the effects of the ripening of karmic actions continues to concern himself with the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing and so correctly perceive a god realm known as Subtle Engagement. Wondering what karmic actions may cause beings to be born there, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing. Thus, he will notice how some people are unwaveringly engaged in virtuous activities that benefit both themselves and others. In this regard, they do not harm others {{page:{number:845,id:UT22084-068-021-100872,folio:F.187.a,volume:V69}}} but are honest by nature. They engage in humane actions that are virtuous, that ripen delightfully, that are cooling, that have a cooling ripening, that are enjoyable, that are auspicious, and that have an auspicious ripening. They are venerated by everyone and dear to everyone. They create happiness in this world and beyond. When they leave this world and pass to the next life, they find parents, refuge, and abundant happiness, as a life in happiness is the product of past positive actions. Such people do not kill or take what was not given, nor do they make others engage in such actions. They keep close company with those who have faith in a discipline that does not permit killing and stealing. They do not associate with or appreciate those whose discipline is flawed, and they do not practice purification together with such people. They always delight in the company of those who are disciplined, and it is therefore with such people that they associate, practice purification, and keep close company. It is with such people that they enjoy themselves and engage in the conduct of the world. They keep in mind the difference between Dharma and non-Dharma. They are virtuous people who refrain from unwholesome action, and they do not delight in the company of evil acquaintances. They are holy people who always maintain pure conduct. They even establish those with highly flawed discipline on the virtuous path, teach them the genuine path, and sow the seeds of virtuous actions within the excellent field of other beings. Their stainless minds are like purified gold and are immersed in the joyous practice of virtue, the effects of which are achieved and experienced in this life as well as beyond it.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.977,id:UT22084-068-021-3433}}} “What are the relevant aspects of giving up killing? When planting flowers for pleasure, some people may use smoke and poison to kill certain snakes, deer, insects, or centipedes, {{page:{number:846,id:UT22084-068-021-100873,folio:F.187.b,volume:V69}}} thinking, ‘In this way I shall protect my flowering plants, creepers, flowers, and fruits.’ Yet people of the kind referred to here do not kill insects with smoke, nor do they use their hands to kill worms within overripe amra fruits or grapes.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.978,id:UT22084-068-021-3434}}} “Moreover, a transgression occurs when worms are killed due to one’s drinking a liquid without having properly examined it. Virtuous people, on the other hand, drink only when they have examined the drink properly and let it sit for a while. They may even abstain from drinking entirely out of a concern for small creatures born from heat and moisture, or from fermentation. Thus, they even give up such subtle forms of killing.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.979,id:UT22084-068-021-3435}}} “How do they give up stealing? How many features of doing so are involved, and what are those features? Some people wish for bad harvests, thinking, ‘In case of a failed harvest I shall be able to increase my profits eightfold. So may the volume measures of Magadha become extremely small—may there be no barley, wheat, or any other grain to be found, and may there be no ripening of any grains for over sixty days. May I alone be in possession of supplies!’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.980,id:UT22084-068-021-3436}}} “Some people may in this way intend to create obstacles for other people, continuously wishing to harm them, just so they can increase their personal wealth. When sentient beings face misfortune and bad times occur, such people will be exhilarated and think, ‘Now comes the time for my happiness, just as I wished.’ At that time, they will then use their barley, wheat, or rice to take advantage of others by using incorrect measures, unsuitable measures, or measures that have been intentionally manipulated. The preparatory stage is when their intention to do so arises, the karmic action is when the deceptive act is carried out, and the conclusion is when there is appreciation and rejoicing after having hoodwinked another person. Good people of the kind mentioned here have relinquished all such misdeeds. {{page:{number:847,id:UT22084-068-021-100874,folio:F.188.a,volume:V69}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.B.981,id:UT22084-068-021-3437}}} “Thus, even if they have little wealth themselves, they will not beguile others with deceptive measures, nor will they rejoice if others do so. If they are merchants, they will sell their goods in the proper way, including when harvests fail. Being righteous and concerned for the Dharma, they will sell their goods for a fair price. This is the way such people give up killing and stealing.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.982,id:UT22084-068-021-3438}}} “How do they cause those engaged in unwholesome actions to do what is virtuous? These holy ones, who do what is good, always act to benefit both themselves and others. When they meet others who have little wealth, who struggle to maintain a livelihood, and who obtain their income under great hardship, they act as donors and benefactors. They also teach them, making them understand and realize the effects of giving. Based on such experience they inspire others to give to those who lack protection and suffer from afflictions, to those who have attained the third concentration, or to other such people. This is how those who maintain a wholesome livelihood practice a threefold generosity with respect to the wealth they obtain in accordance with the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.983,id:UT22084-068-021-3439}}} “The threefold generosity is in terms of preparation (the time of thinking, ‘I shall be generous’), the karmic action (the act of giving), and its conclusion (the subsequent mental appreciation and acknowledgement of the fact that giving took place). Someone who completes such actions twelve hundred times will upon separating from the body go to the joyous higher realms and be born among the gods in Subtle Engagement.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.984,id:UT22084-068-021-3440}}} “As an effect of their subtle engagements in virtuous actions, those who are born there can make themselves big or small according to their wishes. The trees of that heaven are made of the seven precious substances. These trees have extremely bright colors and are stainless due to the past virtuous actions of the gods. They form a forest that is twenty leagues wide, grows ten leagues tall, {{page:{number:848,id:UT22084-068-021-100875,folio:F.188.b,volume:V69}}} and abounds with gorgeous streams, waterfalls, ponds, groves, and parks. The trees stand luminous and stainless in this forest, and their branches and leaves are decorated with myriad colors and flowers.

Moreover, whatever appears on the surface of one tree will simultaneously appear on hundreds of thousands of other trees, thus displaying complete reflections of all the gods’ major and minor body parts. In this way the body of a single god will, in accordance with the reflections of his karmic actions, appear on hundreds of thousands of trees. Another amazing feature of those trees is that, while the individual gods may have engaged in inferior, intermediate, or superior actions, all their varying respective modes of ripening will appear on the surface of the trees. Thus, all the karmic actions they engaged in will now appear upon the bark, roots, branches, leaves, and petals of the trees.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.986,id:UT22084-068-021-3442}}} “Together with a retinue of many hundreds of thousands of goddesses, Śakra, king of the gods, will come to visit this forest. More luminous than a hundred thousand suns, his body will be draped with flower garlands and moistened with ointments. When the gods in Subtle Engagement see him approaching, they will come forth to respectfully receive the king of the gods. Addressing him sincerely, they will join their palms above their heads and venerate him with respect. Wishing to extol and serve the king of the gods, the gods and goddesses who previously engaged in extremely vast positive actions will now surround Śakra and accompany him on his way to the forest for sake of recreation. {{page:{number:849,id:UT22084-068-021-100876,folio:F.189.a,volume:V69}}}

Thus, he will notice how some people of virtuous mind do virtuous deeds for the sake of benefiting both themselves and others. Their minds are stainless and clear, and they pursue virtuous physical and verbal courses of action. In pursuing virtuous and desirable courses of action, they will aspire to be of lasting benefit. Their nature is compassionate, and they have faith in the way actions carry consequences. Their view and action are genuine, and they abide within the two characteristics of discipline. They do not engage in any secret dealings. Their minds and conduct are undistracted, and they do not associate with unvirtuous company. They respect their mothers and fathers, as well as mendicants and brahmins.

If tiny insects should live among their grains of barley, wheat, or rice, these people will not grind the grains. Rather, so that they may protect those creatures, or because they are afraid of stealing, they will abstain from selling that barley or wheat. Likewise, if their oxen, horses, camels, or donkeys should sustain any wounds on their backs due to the loads they carry, and if maggots appear within those wounds, these people will wash the wounds with water or acidulated rice water, and, using a feather, scrape off the maggots and place them on a piece of rotting meat. Afraid of non-Dharma, they will wish that the ox, horse, camel, or donkey may be unharmed by the procedure, and that the maggots will not die.

Such people who engage in virtuous actions will use various types of food to free animals that have been caught by toads, weasels, dogs, or foxes. Once the animals have been released, these people will then provide the carnivores with the alternative food. In this way, they will both feed the hungry carnivores and protect the lives of their prey. Such people will thereby be born among the gods. However, because they took what was not given, they will be born as animals once their lives as gods are over. Such are the ways related to giving up stealing. Not only do they do so themselves, but they also establish others on the path of virtue. Those who are already on a virtuous path they will reaffirm on that path, and they will repeatedly encourage them to pursue it. They will teach them about the effects and causes of karmic actions and make them comprehend this topic. Such are the ways in which they give up killing and stealing.

However, unhinged as they are by their objects, they will once again become swayed by appearances, falling under the power of the delightful sounds, textures, tastes, forms, and smells. In this way, they will not for even a moment keep in mind the actions they have taken in other lives, which were in accordance with what should and should not be done. Craving for objects in the present, they will not comprehend or recollect the suffering that awaits. Deluded by their desire for the objects of the present, they will in this way roam among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals, unless they should be born as gods or humans. Unable to recollect the fierce pain that they have experienced since time without beginning, they thus continue to suffer, encountering the unbearably excruciating pains of hell beings, starving spirits, and animals.

In this manner, he may obtain valuables, clothing, or cashew nuts, and without donating those things to mendicants or brahmins, he may irreverently take possession of them.

The gods also sport among the jewel-studded, flashing peaks of Mount Sumeru. They frolic in pools with golden, silver, crystal, and beryl lotuses. Elsewhere, they play and enjoy themselves within radiant palaces that are adorned with garlands of beautiful balconies.

All that the gods may wish to touch is smooth like the finest fabric. That is to say, all that they touch is stainless and immaculate, unwoven, brightly colored, extremely fragrant, and ravishing to behold.

Wondering what karmic actions may cause beings to be born there, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing. He will then notice how people may adhere to the genuine view and be endowed with discipline, maintaining constant discipline due to a wish to benefit others and thus abiding by genuine conduct of body and speech. Wanting to save the lives of thirsting pasture animals, they may thus, with thoroughly trained minds, irrigate mountainous lands and pastures with ample water from ditches, waterfalls, ponds, and pools. They may also show the way to frightened and distressed beings who have lost their way in the wilderness, gone astray, and are stuck in vast wastelands. In this way, they may free such beings from great anguish, but without any intention to scrounge from them. Instead, they will give them gifts and protect their lives solely for the sake of benefiting beings.

Thus, although there may be reasons to kill beings, they will refrain from doing so. If smaller or larger creatures born from heat and moisture, or born from a womb, live in their house and are destroying it, or if such creatures land on their beds and disturb their sleep, such people who are intent on benefiting beings will nevertheless not kill them. They will not kill toads or scorpions either. Even at the risk of their lives, they will abstain from killing and instead tolerate such poisonous animals. Thus, even if there may be reasons to kill such animals, they will not harm living beings and instead protect them. In this way, they abandon killing.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1189,id:UT22084-068-021-3664}}} “What are the features of their giving up stealing in this case? If such people who pursue virtuous conduct should end up being in charge of a remote outpost, they will protect the water that merchants seeking profit use to mix with black salt. Therefore, even if they are thirsting and on the verge of death, they will not drink from the water before the merchants relinquish the water to them. In this way, they will only drink the water when it is given to them and, even then, they will share it with others. Thus, although they may be able to do so, they will not take any payment before it is given to them. Such is the way that they give up stealing.

Indeed, ‘meeting unvirtuous companions’ is foremost among all the obstacles to virtuous qualities, and so they will neither talk with such people, come and go with them, nor even touch their shadows. {{page:{number:884,id:UT22084-068-021-100911,folio:F.206.b,volume:V69}}} Why is that?

Within it he will show them a stainless wall of beryl, bright like an immaculate mirror. Śakra will then instruct them, ‘Gods, this is the mirror-like wall upon which appear depictions of the experience of karmic effects. Here you can see who engaged in what actions, how the actions were performed, and how respectfully their acts were carried out. You will see what was given to whom; how it was given, and with which type of faith and at which time; and how it was dedicated, when it was dedicated, and for the sake of which resultant birth and under which circumstances it was dedicated.

Look at the agents, times, modes, beneficiaries, and ways of observing the sevenfold discipline, and the times, circumstances, and ways of taking birth that are the results of discipline.

Even if one has mental training and the recipient possesses good qualities and undeceiving characteristics, the effect will be lesser if the substance that is given is imperfect. As the result of such generosity, one may become a powerful starving spirit, or one might live a happy life despite being an animal.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1217,id:UT22084-068-021-3696}}} “ ‘Gods, look at the way the reflections of the results of intermediate generosity are reflected within the mirror of karmic action. Upon this wall are drawn the various effects of karmic action. The effects of intermediate generosity are such that even if one’s mind is untrained and the substance given does not possess any qualities, the results of giving will be intermediate if the recipients simply possess good qualities. Thus, one will be born among the humans in Godānīya in the west or Videha in the east, or one will reap results among animals, yakṣas, or asuras.’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1218,id:UT22084-068-021-3697}}} “The attainments of such intermediate results are directly perceptible to the gods, as if in a mirror. Śakra at this point will continue to explain the three kinds of effects of generosity that appear as reflections in the mirror of karmic actions: ‘Gods, behold the effects of lesser, intermediate, and supreme generosity. Lesser generosity cannot be transformed, but it may be performed with an untrained mind with reference to a perfect field. What is meant by an untrained mind? The donor may benefit living beings tremendously, yet despite the presence of recipients and the substances that are given, the donor may lack a pure mind and physical capacity, and therefore he may not respectfully prostrate, and so forth. Thus, even if both the recipient field and the substances given possess fine qualities, {{page:{number:891,id:UT22084-068-021-100918,folio:F.210.a,volume:V69}}} his mind does not. Hence, gaze upon the surface of the mirror of karmic actions to see how guileless generosity may lead such people to become the king or a great minister among hill people or barbarians.’ In this manner, Śakra will instruct the gods.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1219,id:UT22084-068-021-3698}}} “ ‘Moreover, supreme generosity is engaged in attentively with respect to a recipient of perfect qualities. It also involves substances of perfect qualities and is performed with a perfectly trained mind. The sacred recipient consists of the Buddha, and so forth; perfect substances are food, and so forth; and the trained mind is inspired and respectful. As an effect of such great generosity, one will be born among gods and humans. As a god, one will be a great god. As a human, one will become a universal monarch who rules the four continents and is endowed with great miraculous powers and possesses the seven precious substances and the seven subsidiary precious substances. One will be righteous and follow the Dharma. Engaging in all that is excellent, one will accomplish discipline and wisdom, and one will enter the city of the transcendence of suffering. Such generosity is unsurpassable—this is unsurpassable generosity.’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1220,id:UT22084-068-021-3699}}} “Śakra will then continue to explain to the gods about the effects of karmic actions as they appear upon the utterly stainless surface of the beryl wall of karmic action: ‘Look at the reflections of the effects of another set of the three kinds of generosity. Giving may occur in terms of material things, freedom from fear, and the Dharma. Giving material things makes one wealthy, just as before. As the effect of giving freedom from fear, one will become the king of an excellent country and enjoy freedom from the fear of weapons, failed harvests, wilderness, and untimely death. One will have no fear of competitors, disease, {{page:{number:892,id:UT22084-068-021-100919,folio:F.210.b,volume:V69}}} fire, water, or death. Free from such fears, one will live long as a king or a great minister. This is the way the effects of giving freedom from fear, which is an intermediate type of generosity, appears in the mirror of karmic actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1221,id:UT22084-068-021-3700}}} “ ‘Moreover, the effects of the kinds of generosity that are supreme appear upon the mirror of karmic actions. Giving the Dharma is the best among all forms of generosity because it serves as the seed for going beyond the whole of cyclic existence. Thus, the effects of this supreme generosity ripen as the three kinds of awakening. Further effects of giving the Dharma are also apparent, for such giving may be motivated by a concern for one’s livelihood, for fame, for the subjugation of competitors, or exclusively for benefiting others. Here the concern for one’s livelihood does not indicate an altruistic practice but rather a context where one teaches the Dharma merely for the sake of having a livelihood. In other words, one’s teaching is not delivered with a heart that is trained in altruism but instead given solely for the sake of obtaining wealth. When in this way the teacher does not practice what he preaches, the giving is inferior. Any wealth that may be obtained thereby will be wasted because of resorting to alcohol or female companions. In this way, such a person who has abandoned discipline is really nothing more than a poser, and such a gift of Dharma will therefore have lesser effects. How will one be born when such generosity ripens? This can be learned from the mirror of karmic action, which shows that due to such lesser giving of the Dharma, one will become a wise bird that lives among the gods and teaches them in verse.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1222,id:UT22084-068-021-3701}}} “ ‘What is the intermediate way of giving the Dharma? If one teaches the Dharma for the sake of fame, or does so aggressively in order to outrival other teachers, then the effects of such Dharma generosity are lesser. As they ripen, {{page:{number:893,id:UT22084-068-021-100920,folio:F.211.a,volume:V69}}} one will be born among gods or humans of an intermediate caliber.’ In this way, Śakra will teach the gods by letting them gaze upon the surface of the mirror of karmic actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1223,id:UT22084-068-021-3702}}} “ ‘Moreover, the supreme way of giving the Dharma is to teach for the sake of training the mind, making the mind flawless, and taming the mind. One does not do so for the sake of maintaining a livelihood, but introduces others who suffer from wrong views to the Dharma-Vinaya without mooching off of them. Such a practice that benefits oneself and others and culminates in the transcendence of suffering is the supreme way of giving the Dharma.’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1224,id:UT22084-068-021-3703}}} “ Next, Śakra will teach and inform the gods about another set of effects of giving the Dharma: ‘The teaching of Dharma is of an inferior kind when no liberation through insight has occurred, intermediate when one adheres to discipline, and supreme when there is liberation through insight. Moreover, when there is inferior insight, one lacks a genuine understanding of the Dharma teaching on generosity. Instead, one teaches exclusively the effects of generosity. Based on such causes and on such grounds, one then practices generosity, as well as discipline and insight. In this manner, one follows the Dharma through faith alone and thus obtains the state of a worthy one who has exhausted defilements and is liberated from both aspects. Presenting the Dharma in such a way is an inferior way to speak on generosity.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1225,id:UT22084-068-021-3704}}} “ ‘The intermediate way of giving the Dharma employs teachings on discipline that are delivered based on having a well-trained mind and an intermediate level of insight. The ripening effects of such activity likewise appear upon the mirror of karmic actions. Practicing insight, one thus becomes a worthy one or, if one’s defilements are brought to exhaustion extremely quickly, one becomes a solitary buddha. The karmic ripening of such an intermediate gift of the Dharma is conspicuous upon the surface of the mirror of karmic actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1226,id:UT22084-068-021-3705}}} “ ‘Furthermore, the supreme way of giving the Dharma is accomplished through a perfectly well-trained mind. Without any expectations, one imparts knowledge and explains all about the excellent qualities. Teaching the Dharma in this way, one benefits others. {{page:{number:894,id:UT22084-068-021-100921,folio:F.211.b,volume:V69}}} One thereby causes others to develop renunciation by feeling the drawbacks of desire, and one establishes those who suffer from wrong views in the Dharma-Vinaya, teaching them the flawless Dharma-Vinaya. Such generosity with the Dharma is supreme and its effect is awakening—becoming a perfect buddha, someone learned and virtuous, an unsurpassed guide of beings, and a teacher of gods and humans. Such is the unsurpassable Dharma-Vinaya, that which is virtuous in the beginning, middle, and end. Such is the supreme way of giving the Dharma.’

The god instructed me, “Let us not be careless. {{page:{number:896,id:UT22084-068-021-100923,folio:F.212.b,volume:V69}}} Take care not to be careless so that you end up appearing in that mirror of karmic actions.

This is what that blessed one has taught in order to benefit the gods. He thereby tamed the gods—by means of the mirror of karmic actions, he vanquished their conceit and placed them on the path of virtue. Having done so, he then left for Jambudvīpa.” When I heard this from the god, I felt tremendously happy and the other gods also felt ashamed.

The faces of the mountains are decorated with the seven precious substances, numerous species of birds warble, and the wish-fulfilling trees are splendid and luminous like the sun.

If, when free from those realms, one is born as a starving spirit, one will be extremely jealous and aggressive, and one will be killed by others by means of various weapons. If, due to the connections of the net of karmic actions, one is subsequently born among the animals, one will take birth in the realm of the piśācas and will be killed by weapons for the sake of one’s flesh. Alternatively, one might be born as a hideous lion or tiger that eats raw meat and is killed by weapons. If one is subsequently reborn as a human, one will be inclined to fight and struggle and will never have any ease of mind. One will thus succumb to weapons and one’s life will be short.

If, subsequent to one’s life there, one should be born among the starving spirits, one will, just as before, be killed by weapons. In the unlikely event that one is not killed and thus finds some means of survival, other starving spirits will reduce one’s major and minor body parts to dust and take off with them. When one thus perishes, one might be born as an animal. In that case one will become a swallow or an animal that suffers in the wilderness without water, thus succumbing to hunger and thirst. If one is thereafter born among humans, one will be poor and live during times of war and famine. In the end, one will be killed by weapons or die from starvation. When at times one finds some sustenance, others will take it away or one will be unable to digest it. If, due to karmic actions to be experienced in other lives, one should be born among the gods, one’s size, color, and shape will also be inferior. One’s ambrosia will be flawed, and one will feel extremely embarrassed in the presence of the other gods. One’s instruments among the five types will not have a pleasant tune and one’s life will be short. Such is the display of karmic effects that the gods perceive.

Once one is free from those realms, one may be born among the starving spirits. One will then become a starving spirit subsisting on vomit. Though one’s life will be long, whenever one succeeds in obtaining some nourishing food, others will steal it. {{page:{number:904,id:UT22084-068-021-100931,folio:F.216.b,volume:V69}}} Before one’s very eyes, other starving spirits will abduct one’s wife and, when one takes up arms, one will be struck down by their weapons and killed. If, when free from such an existence, one is born among the animals, one will become a buffalo, horse, cow, vomit eater, or the like, and one will live a long life. But because one is so feeble, one will be robbed of one’s possessions. If, when free from such an existence, one should be born with the general lot in life of a human, one will have a short life and be poor, and others will run off with one’s wife.

Thus, the karmic effects that manifest as the Great Howling Hell and its neighboring regions will likewise appear just as they were presented before. If, when free from that, one should be born among the starving spirits, one will always live long and, in accordance with one’s karmic actions, one will be born in an unholy place or as a starving spirit whose neck is as thin as a needle. Emaciated from starvation, one will see one’s wife abducted by others. In order to achieve some semblance of satiation, one may attempt to eat poison but will only be seared by the unbearable effects of the poison. When free from such an existence, one may then be born among the animals, in which case one will suffer the torments of their mutual predation. If, when free from such an animal existence, one should be born among the gods, one will, in accordance with one’s karmic actions, have an inferior size, color, and shape, and one’s life will be short since one will be slain in the war between the gods and asuras.

Seven things must be properly understood: the seven branches of awakening. One must travel the eightfold path: right intention, and so forth.

A mind that is carried away by carelessness will fail to comprehend mundane reality, just as it will fail to comprehend the reality that transcends the world. When a mind carried away by carelessness sees a form, it does not comprehend its real condition, and thus it will fail to correctly observe the body. It does not examine the body by engaging with the four truths of noble beings. It does not examine reality.

One will not be able to tell what it means, and one will therefore not develop any knowledge of mundane matters. Nor will one be able to understand the meaning that is explained in the sūtras, verses, songs, prophecies, purposeful expressions, ethical narrations, narratives, parables, past-life stories, elaborate teachings, marvels, or decisive explications. One will be unable to understand the meaning taught in these scriptures. Those carried away by carelessness will, at the time of death, fall under the power of the Lord of Death.

The experiences of pleasure, pain, and that which is neither enjoyable nor painful. Mighty ones, contemplation is engagement with phenomena. Intention is the thought to engage in a given activity. Interest is primarily the factor that engenders action. Faith refers precisely to the mind of faith. Diligence is primarily enthusiasm. Mindfulness is to avoid forgetting what was apprehended and to thus be free from delusion. Absorption is primarily one-pointed mind.

Inappropriate observation is the lack of proper attention to phenomena and believing that what is actually unclean is clean. Wrong interest is primarily a fascination based on improper apprehension and grasping. Agitation is primarily an unsettled mind. Ignorance is lack of knowledge of the factors of the three realms.

From the eye, form, light, space, and mental activity. Aural consciousness does not arise from such factors because sounds may be heard in the dark as well as in the light. Thus, mighty ones, light is not a factor as it does not affect anything in this regard. This is, moreover, also the case with respect to the nose, tongue, body, and mind. Mighty ones, light is not a factor for it does not affect anything at all in those cases. Mental consciousness both may and may not arise in dependence on light. How is that so?

Thus, the eye depends on a predominance of the fire and earth elements. For the tongue, the predominant element is water. For the ears, space is the predominant element. Moreover, whenever the space in the throat and the cavities is predominant it becomes overpowering.

Instead, one recollects, “The senses of ordinary, childish beings are insatiable.” {{page:{number:971,id:UT22084-068-021-100998,folio:F.250.a,volume:V69}}}

The compulsion to become rich and famous is corrupting for a mendicant. Such a person’s skin will crack open, and then the same will happen to his flesh. As his flesh breaks open, his veins will be severed, and when his veins are cut, his bones will crack, and the marrow will ooze out. Such are the effects of wealth and fame. Wealth and fame are obstacles to all virtuous qualities. Therefore, the proper practice of recollection is to be one-pointedly mindful of that.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1580,id:UT22084-068-021-4091}}} “ ‘Next, a fifth recollection is cultivated. Here one does not roam towns, cities, or populated areas. One does not stay in towns and does not engage in conversations with people. One does not participate in mundane diversions or celebrations. Those who stay in towns, cities, or populated areas become distracted and are unable even to take care of themselves. Mindfulness arises as one sees those facts.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1581,id:UT22084-068-021-4092}}} “ ‘Next, a sixth recollection is cultivated. Considering the abovementioned contexts to be faulty, one instead resides alone and unaccompanied in charnel grounds, at the foot of a tree, in a haystack, in a mountain wilderness, or in an abandoned building. The monk who thus remains uninvolved will accomplish virtuous qualities and relinquish what is to be relinquished.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1582,id:UT22084-068-021-4093}}} “ ‘Next, a seventh recollection is cultivated. In this case, one does not become excited by accounts of the divine realms, nor does one become depressed by accounts of the hells. Instead, one thinks, “The gods will fall in the end. They will be hurt and come under the control of the Lord of Death’s henchmen. The beings in hell are also dragged along by karmic action. I find nothing to rejoice in here, {{page:{number:972,id:UT22084-068-021-100999,folio:F.250.b,volume:V69}}} and I shall also discourage others from doing so.” Thus, one is neither fond of the higher realms nor fearful of hell. This abandonment of fondness and fear is, in essence, the recollection of virtue, and thus one cultivates this recollection.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1583,id:UT22084-068-021-4094}}} “ ‘Next, an eighth recollection is cultivated. In this case, one thinks, “It is good that I remain mindful, for it causes the appearance of unvirtuous phenomena to wane and wear out, crushing and relinquishing them. On the other hand, when unvirtuous factors arise in my mind, it makes my mindfulness decrease and causes obstacles. Hence, I shall develop virtuous recollections.” Thus, from moment to moment, one pays careful attention to perceived objects and characteristics. As one’s recollections become continuous and consolidated within the mind, one’s mindfulness becomes dexterous and one will be able to stay clear of the enemy—the billowing waves in the river of mistaken objects.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1584,id:UT22084-068-021-4095}}} “ ‘Next, a ninth recollection is cultivated. In this case, every single day, one recollects the qualities of the buddhas and develops constant respect for the sacred Dharma. One gives rise to faith in spiritual teachers, adheres to their practices, and develops a mind of tremendous equanimity. One confines one’s visual sphere to the length of a yoke and remains mindful with the wish to benefit all sentient beings. This effective cultivation of mindfulness will eventually culminate in the transcendence of suffering.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1585,id:UT22084-068-021-4096}}} “ ‘Next, a tenth recollection is cultivated. As one’s mindfulness becomes tremendously stable, one remains aware of the immanence of four great terrors: aging, disease, destitution, and death. Constantly fearful of those great enemies, one does not think happy thoughts. Additionally, one sees four factors to be extremely unstable: life, health, youth, and prosperity. In this way, while constantly fearful of the four terrors, one also accustoms oneself to the four instabilities, and thus one will not be harmed by objects and will not become swayed by desires. {{page:{number:973,id:UT22084-068-021-101000,folio:F.251.a,volume:V69}}} In this way, while remaining mindful, one gains the power to bring down the mountain of afflictions.

One is also not lazy or negligent. Since it is detrimental for one person to discriminate against another, one will also abstain from harming or benefiting others. In this way, one’s mind brightens, one’s mindfulness becomes dexterous, and one eagerly practices non-aggression.

Those who eagerly listen to and retain the Dharma will in turn come to firmly uphold it. Thus, one will know how to distinguish evil from its opposite. As when forms hidden in the dark become perceptible with the help of a lamp, one becomes able to see what is evil and virtuous by means of the lamp of the Dharma taught by the blessed ones. Those who develop a mindfulness that is tremendously stable will not be caught in the net of afflictions and will not fall under the sway of the māras. This is how one cultivates the twelfth recollection.

In this case, one is continuously mindful of the characteristics of the body, mind, and sensations. That which is kept in mind in this way is thereby ascertained and firmly observed. Such mental activity will prevent one from being careless and ensure that one is careful. One who does so will not be ruled by the henchmen of the Lord of Death and instead become independent. One’s recollection will not wane and one will avoid engagements that are untimely or involve the wrong objects or the wrong activities. In this way, these recollections are connected to all aspects of mindfulness.

Hence, one will no longer be ruined by carelessness. The fourteen are interest, diligence, serenity, respect for teachers, giving up unwholesome company, familiarization with the words of buddhas, familiarization with correct mental activity, giving up agitation, faith in the causal relationships pertaining to Dharma and non-Dharma, forgetting previous desires, giving up ogling females, avoiding company and associations with friends, apprehending all objects correctly, and fear of birth and death. Training the mind with those fourteen is a very thorough practice. Such causes will bring complete purification, and one will not encounter the messengers of the lower realms at the time of death, the gates to the lower realms will not open, one will not be mistaken with respect to the sacred Dharma, one will not be led off as if pulled by a rope around one’s neck, and one will no longer act like an evil man’s trusted messenger. Those fourteen ensure that one attains the sacred Dharma, and they train and purify the mind tremendously. Thus, those who perfect them will be ushered in among gods and humans, and later the door to the city of suffering’s transcendence will be opened to them. Therefore, mighty ones, those who train their minds with those factors will accomplish tremendous purification. They will not fall under the sway of the henchmen of the Lord of Death.’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1590,id:UT22084-068-021-4101}}} “The gods are struck by fear of the lower realms and distressed by the sight of the Lord of Death’s henchmen; Śakra will continue to teach the Dharma to them: ‘Here, I have taught you the Dharma gradually, by means of a set of fourteen factors. Now I shall similarly explain to you a set of fifteen principles. What are the fifteen principles? They are the ones associated with relinquishment, contempt, discernment, and reversal once one has emerged from the household and committed to the life of a mendicant. {{page:{number:975,id:UT22084-068-021-101002,folio:F.252.a,volume:V69}}} First of all one must recognize the saffron-colored robes and wear the saffron-colored garments in such a way that they serve to prevent pride. Why is that? Because those who are otherwise infatuated with pride on account of their saffron-colored robes behave and act like oxen and arrogantly indulge in flirtation. They do not practice virtuous factors but indulge in ogling women. As they become agitated, the pride they have due to their robes also leads to other disrespectful attitudes. Therefore, this clothing must be such that it protects one from heat and cold and simply covers one’s body. That way, one will not fall prey to carelessness and, consequently, one will not have any regrets at the time of death. This is the first among the principles to be understood.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1591,id:UT22084-068-021-4102}}} “ ‘The second principle to understand is the mendicant’s contentment. When a religious person or a mendicant considers taking on the discipline and thus begins to follow the precepts, he should not accept bedding, medical supplies, or the like from benefactors and donors. In that way, he will avoid obstacles. That is the second principle to be understood.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1592,id:UT22084-068-021-4103}}} “ ‘The third principle to understand is that if one becomes attached to proper beds, one may give up dwelling in the wilderness and forests and instead go to receive alms at places that are not advantageous, or one might go, filled with desire, to a town or city where plentiful gruel is offered. In such cases, great obstacles will occur, one will fail to practice virtuous qualities, and one will end up lacking contentment. Therefore, the best of mendicants is the one who is content and careful. Mendicants who lack contentment and are fond of sleep are deceived {{page:{number:976,id:UT22084-068-021-101003,folio:F.252.b,volume:V69}}} and will encounter obstacles among unvirtuous people, as if they were eating filthy vomit.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1593,id:UT22084-068-021-4104}}} “ ‘Furthermore, the fourth principle to understand is as follows. One might be very skilled in reciting the scriptures and, thinking that this practice alone suffices, one might fail to train further. Instead, one should practice contentment by thinking, “If benefactors and donors hear me recite, they might provide me with medical supplies and various other necessities. Yet this would only create obstacles for me, so that would not be proper.” Thus, the monk will develop contentment.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1594,id:UT22084-068-021-4105}}} “ ‘The fifth principle to understand concerns having few desires, being content, and being careful. This relates to when the saṅgha entrusts a monk to obtain medicine or provisions by sending him to visit benefactors and donors. When visiting households on this errand, the monk may end up consuming alcoholic beverages in the presence of the benefactors. In this way, he will encounter destructive and harmful obstacles, and his physical hardships and effort will be meaningless. Why is that? Because he goes to those homes in a covetous state of mind and craves the taste of alcohol. In this way, he goes there in a disrespectful manner. Thus, he neither benefits himself nor the sick, nor does he accomplish the tasks of the saṅgha. Among all forms of disrespectful activity, these three are the greatest: visiting the home of a single person, taking pleasure in food and drink, and engaging in meaningless chatter. Both mundane people as well as those who transcend the world will scorn those three. Therefore, these should be given up by those who adhere to contentment and carefulness.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1595,id:UT22084-068-021-4106}}} “ ‘Moreover, the sixth principle to understand is as follows. A mendicant who is practicing in order to curtail great desires, {{page:{number:977,id:UT22084-068-021-101004,folio:F.253.a,volume:V69}}} or a monk who genuinely lives by alms, should only accept an amount of alms that is sufficient for one day, and he should not collect anything for the next day. If he becomes attached, he will lose his humility, and his mind will be disturbed in terms of his concentration and his desires. If he begins to worry that his alms will run out, he will become attached to even minor things that will turn into obstacles. Needless to mention that it will also be an obstacle if he should develop desire for wealth or praise. Any craving in relation to one’s possessions constitutes a strong bond.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1596,id:UT22084-068-021-4107}}} “ ‘What, then, is the seventh principle to understand? When traveling through a land or area where people have not heard of or seen him before, a monk who is practicing to curtail great desires should not say to the local people that he has gone forth from a great family. He should not say, “I became ordained within such and such a great caste, I am a monk that hails from an important family.” Likewise, if his companions or assistants should say so, he ought to stop them. If a benefactor or donor should offer more bedding or medical supplies than the minimum required for spiritual practice, the monk may think, “If I accept this, I will become an owner of property. But if I don’t accept it, this person will be unhappy. If he becomes unhappy with me, that will turn into an obstacle for him, and that would not be helpful in the next life.” When a monk keeps property based on this knowledge, he will curtail great desire, he will not be caught up in existence, and he will not become distracted but maintain mindfulness. He will take full delight in the sacred Dharma and the practice of concentration. Correctly observing body, mind, sensations, and phenomena, he will decrease great desire and thus be able to break free from the prison of existence. {{page:{number:978,id:UT22084-068-021-101005,folio:F.253.b,volume:V69}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1597,id:UT22084-068-021-4108}}} “ ‘A monk who is practicing in order to curtail great desires and who is content and free from the terrors of wealth and fame must also understand an eighth principle. What is that principle? Such a person should not travel, stay, or walk with a mendicant who mingles with many people, who has plenty of pots and other utensils, who is obsessed with being rich and famous, who is attached to food, who is excited about invitations, and who wants to visit friends and relatives. Why is that? Because people will know and talk about that monk who is ruined by carelessness and thus obsessed with wealth and fame. In this way, those who associate with him will also become corrupted by wealth and fame. On the other hand, if one does not accept all the things that the other monk has received, that will upset the monk who has all the pots and utensils and who is fond of invitations. That monk will then go before benefactors and donors to defame the monk who is practicing to curtail great desires and tell them, “That monk is a hypocrite. He keeps fooling everyone, but inside he is a sinner.” This will thereby harm both the other monk and the first one. Therefore, in consideration of the ensuing mental flaws, a monk who is practicing to curtail great desires should not associate with someone who is filled with great desires.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1598,id:UT22084-068-021-4109}}} “ ‘A monk who is practicing to curtail great desires, who is afraid and wary of cyclic existence, who stays clear of wealth and fame, and who remains in constant mental composure, should also comprehend a ninth principle. What is that principle? If a householder who is learned in the fields of knowledge takes ordination, he should not advertise his learning. He should not let it be known that he is an accomplished doctor, painter, dancer, phlebotomist, or the like, nor should he broadcast that he is learned in one of the other fields. Why is that? If benefactors or donors consider him to be obsessed with being rich and famous, that will become an obstacle for him, {{page:{number:979,id:UT22084-068-021-101006,folio:F.254.a,volume:V69}}} and, if he becomes attached to these factors, he will fail to cultivate virtuous factors. He will not develop a one-pointed mind, and his mind will not be directed toward the sustenance of concentration. Instead, he will encounter obstacles and fail to benefit himself or others. One must therefore distance oneself from that and give up such ways of thinking and such attachments entirely, since they are not helpful.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1599,id:UT22084-068-021-4110}}} “ ‘An intelligent monk who is practicing to curtail great desires, and who is intent on giving up wealth and fame, should also comprehend a tenth principle. It may happen that he arrives at a temple near a city, town, village, or market and finds the place to be full of monks and nuns who live alongside restaurants, bars, merchants, and fornicators. He may also see that some monks there are living in huts together with non-monastic company. In that case, that monk who is practicing to curtail great desires, whose mind is serene, and who is intent on severing the bonds of the māras should not take up residence there. Why is that? Because as the people of that city, town, village, or market come to understand that the monks there are unstable and that their discipline is flawed, they may choose to offer their wealth and respect to that single monk alone. If at that point the monk accepts their offerings, his great desires will not diminish. However, if he does not accept them, that could become an obstacle for the donors. The situation may also become an obstacle for other monks, who might incur the flaw of resenting those who donate exclusively to that single monk. Hence, since it involves all these problems, a monk who is practicing in order to curtail great desires should not stay with individuals who live in such ways.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1600,id:UT22084-068-021-4111}}} “ ‘Next, an eleventh principle must be comprehended. If omens should appear in one’s mind due to mundane insight, one should not disclose these to others. If one does so, others may take one to be a worthy one and hence offer their wealth and respect, and that may become an obstacle. One will fail to diminish great desires. {{page:{number:980,id:UT22084-068-021-101007,folio:F.254.b,volume:V69}}}

Someone who has received little education may carry relics of the Blessed One from city to city, town to town, village to village, and market to market, thus displaying these wondrous articles with the hope that benefactors may be inspired to offer great gifts to such objects. Moreover, such a person may also commend, praise, and attempt to please another monk who is practicing to curtail great desires and who is tremendously learned. In this way, he will seek to associate with the learned monk so as to obtain the wealth of donors and benefactors, who seek Dharma teachings from the learned monk and have respect for the relics on display. Yet, a person who is practicing to curtail great desires and who is thoroughly content should not accompany or reside with such an individual, because if benefactors and donors become aware that the other person’s discipline is flawed, that will become an obstacle for them. Therefore, whoever has a correct attitude, or who is terrified and afraid of the realm of the Lord of Death, or who is cautious of becoming careless, should not accompany people with flawed discipline.

However, this state differs from the summit due to its acceptance of the truth of the three occasions.{{note:{index:323,id:UT22084-068-021-4135}}} In this regard, because of such acceptance, these factors are known as acceptance. The increase of acceptance brings the instantaneous manifestation of the supreme among all mundane phenomena. That is when such a mind and mental states arise. Subsequent to the attainment of supreme phenomena comes entry into the stream, at which point one gains control of one’s body. One will then neither see nor fear any henchmen of the Lord of Death. The primary factor for all those attainments {{page:{number:985,id:UT22084-068-021-101012,folio:F.257.a,volume:V69}}} is familiarity with carefulness.’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1623,id:UT22084-068-021-4136}}} “At this point Śakra will utter the following verses:
“ ‘Those who know the practice of exhaling and inhaling
Are aware of the reality of the sixteen features.
Those who understand the way of heat
Will be expert regarding the nature of acceptance.

What is meant by the intermediate existence? This refers to the forms that appear at the time of death. When human beings die in the realm of humans and are about to be born among the gods, they will perceive delightful signs in the intermediate existence. Thus, white fabrics or slender, smooth trumpet-flowers will fall, and at the same time they will feel extremely joyous and their faces will brighten. Thereafter they will perceive delightful forests, ponds, rivers, landscapes, and parks, and they will hear laughter, joking, and captivating songs. {{page:{number:986,id:UT22084-068-021-101013,folio:F.257.b,volume:V69}}} Next, they will sense delicious and unprecedented fragrances of numerous fine substances. Then, they will experience extremely smooth textures, and after that, the gods and goddesses will appear. Such are the manifestations of positive karmic actions. When such people’s vital functions have been cut off, these signs will manifest, and they will bear beautiful smiles and their faces will have a clear hue. These diseased people will be taken in by those signs and so they will not see, hear, or think of their crying and lamenting family and friends. Instead, they will die while experiencing extremely pleasant phenomena.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1629,id:UT22084-068-021-4143}}}“ ‘Such a deeply enjoyable intermediate existence occurs in accord with the realms of the gods, just as when a seal leaves its imprint. Reflections of the god realms appear in concordance with the six abodes of the desire realm, and thus one experiences enjoyments, places, textures, and sights that accord with those realms. Later, during the period of becoming, one will perceive the heaven into which one is to be born as extremely excellent and will therefore take birth there due to one’s craving for objects. This is how one is born, and this is how the first intermediate existence is perceived.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1630,id:UT22084-068-021-4144}}} “ ‘Mighty gods, what other intermediate existences are there? If human beings die in Jambudvīpa and are to be born in the continent of Kuru to the north, they will perceive a red fabric with white apertures that is light, smooth, and extremely beautiful. They will become attached to that and hold on to it. People who die this way will be waving their hands through the air and those around them will say that he or she is grasping at the sky. Then a wind will rise and, at the time of death, they will first feel cold and seek warmth. Warmth will then manifest and the cold will disappear. Their contact with the warmth produces pleasure, and as they focus on that pleasure, their minds become consumed {{page:{number:987,id:UT22084-068-021-101014,folio:F.258.a,volume:V69}}} by it to the extent that they no longer hear any sounds of crying, lamentation, or desperation. However, in some rare circumstances, their previous karmic actions lack stability, and thus they may nevertheless hear some noises. In that case they will be carried elsewhere by the winds of karmic action. This is how family and friends can create obstacles at the time of death. Otherwise, they will take birth in Kuru in the north. As the signs of virtue begin to manifest, they will perceive a blue lake full of swans, ducks, and geese and notice that the lake is covered by flowers. They will proceed to rush toward the lake. Then, as the final moments of their lives pass, they die. Next, the vision of the lake will unfold and they will begin to frolic among the lotus flowers. If they are about to take birth from a mother’s womb in the continent of Kuru in the north, they will move from the lake onto dry land. There, they see their future parents copulating, but they will misinterpret the sight, taking it instead to be a pair of mating geese. If they are about to become a woman, they will perceive themselves as a female goose, and if they are about to become a man, they will see themselves as a male goose. In the latter case, they will chase away the male goose and then copulate with their future mother. That leads to birth in Kuru in the north. Such is the second intermediate existence.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1631,id:UT22084-068-021-4145}}} “ ‘If, following one’s death in Jambudvīpa, one is about to be born among the humans on the continent of Godānīya in the west, one will at the time of death perceive one’s entire home as yellow, and one will perceive a cloud-like fabric of a fine yellow color. As one seeks to clutch onto the fabric, those nearby will cry and say that he or she is grasping at the sky. Then follows the final moment of mind in the death process, and one will thereafter perceive the forms of cows and herds of cattle, as if in a dream. During the intercourse of one’s prospective parents, one will, if one is about to be born as a man, see oneself as a magnificent bull that challenges the head of the herd. {{page:{number:988,id:UT22084-068-021-101015,folio:F.258.b,volume:V69}}} Successfully chasing away one’s father, one next copulates with one’s mother, and so one is born on Godānīya in the west. Such is the third intermediate existence.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1632,id:UT22084-068-021-4146}}} “ ‘A fourth intermediate existence leads to birth among the humans on the continent of Videha in the east. In such a case, one will, at the end of one’s life, on the verge of death, perceive a blue fabric and, even though one remains within one’s home, one will behold a beautiful deep blue sky. While enjoying that sight, one will also be concerned that the sky might fall upon oneself. At that point, the assembled friends will say that he or she is grasping at the sky. Next follows the moment at the end of the death process, and in the ensuing intermediate existence one will now perceive oneself as a horse. On the continent of Videha in the east, one will then see one’s future parents as a copulating stallion and mare. If one is about to be born as a male, one will feel like mounting the mare, and if one is going to become a female, one will want to be mounted by the stallion. Such is the fourth intermediate existence.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1633,id:UT22084-068-021-4147}}} “ ‘A fifth intermediate existence comes about in the following way. What are the definitive signs, in accord with the higher realms, that can be seen when someone is dying in Videha in the east? Mighty ones, when someone who has performed great actions, and in particular great mind-governed actions, dies, the following signs will occur when he or she is about to be born into the world of the gods. As if in a dream, one will at first feel alone and try to hold on to the sky. Then, as if in a dream, one will perceive beautiful and fragrant flowers in the most exquisite colors. {{page:{number:989,id:UT22084-068-021-101016,folio:F.259.a,volume:V69}}} Those magnificent flowers are blue, yellow, red, and white. As they appear in one’s hands, one will develop a fondness for them, thinking, ‘I wish to see and climb the great trees from which these flowers come.’ Then, following those mental perceptions, the mind intent on the future life arises. Thus, in the intermediate existence one will perceive many different trees with blue, yellow, and white flowers. At that point one thinks, ‘I must climb those trees,’ and thereupon one begins to climb the trees, or, alternatively, one begins to climb Mount Sumeru. Next, one beholds the world of the gods with its beautiful flowers and fruits. At that point, one will think, ‘I must go there! I want to live in those lands with such perfect fruits!’ Such is the fifth type of minor birth.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1634,id:UT22084-068-021-4148}}} “ ‘A sixth intermediate existence is as follows. When those on the continent of Kuru in the north, who have performed previous actions of an intermediate quality, die there, certain signs will manifest in the intermediate existence. At the time of death, such people will perceive an extremely beautiful lotus flower adorned by gorgeous bees. Attached to its delectable fragrance, the beings in the intermediate state will climb the flower, yet as soon as they begin to ascend it, the flower will soar off into space. Alternatively, they may also just find themselves ascending into the sky, as if in a dream. At the time of their birth, they will perceive beautiful lotus flowers surrounded by lovely bees, and at that point they will make the wish, “May this place with such flowers be mine!” At that very moment, they will take birth—such are the links of existence. Thus, one may also take birth among the gods in the heavens based on intermediate actions. {{page:{number:990,id:UT22084-068-021-101017,folio:F.259.b,volume:V69}}}

In this case, if one dies on the continent of Kuru in the north, one will at the time of one’s death perceive beautiful places and exquisite forests and parks. When facing this sight, one will begin to climb toward them, and as one keeps climbing, one will ascend into the sky. Climbing in this way, one will encounter beautiful sights everywhere, and so one will think, “Now I must go and stay here.” Birth then follows the very moment one has had this thought. That is how birth from the realm of Kuru in the north occurs based on supreme karmic actions. That is the seventh link to existence.

Mighty ones, one shall then perceive delightful forests that are studded with beautiful jewels, and one will enjoy the most pleasant fragrances. No terrible sensations will occur at the time of death, nor will one’s mind become muddied by any other sensation. Thus, one’s mind will be bright at the time of death. As the end of life is reached, one will perceive palaces and parklands, and the sight of them will make one think, “I must enter those palaces!” As one enters them and thus proceeds into the intermediate existence, one will see itinerant gods moving to and fro, just as one will perceive mountainous lands and ranges where the gods dwell, meet, or roam. Next, one will perceive oneself, and thus one will enter that place. Everything is experienced vividly, as if in a dream. As one beholds the many different palaces {{page:{number:991,id:UT22084-068-021-101018,folio:F.260.a,volume:V69}}} and their abundant pleasures, one will think, “I must enter there!” As soon as that thought occurs, one is born. Such is the way that becoming manifests, conditioned by grasping, within the links of existence. This way of taking birth can be the result of supreme, intermediate, or lesser factors. As one sees the exquisite forests, groves, and parks, one will develop desire for them, and so one is born into this realm from Kuru in the north.

Why is that? Because the gods have become used to such a state of mind and so, having spent their past human lives within that, their craving has now become extremely powerful. Mighty ones, such are the signs, the cooling,{{note:{index:324,id:UT22084-068-021-4152}}} and the bases that manifest when someone is born here after having died in Kuru in the north.

Mighty ones, when people on the western continent of Godānīya are dying and the moment of death arrives, those who are moved by positive karmic conditions will not hear forceful noises, nor will they experience painful sickness, and their senses will remain lucid.

The water’s temperature is neither too cold nor overly warm. They are then carried by the water, and the closer they come to the other shore, the closer they get to their ensuing birth. As they take birth due to afflictions, they will then perceive that the shore is filled with gorgeous jewelry-clad women who are singing and dancing. Seeing them, they will feel sexual desire and thus they will approach the women with the urge to have intercourse. When one couples with one of the women, conception occurs, and one experiences the divine pleasures. Birth is the time of awakening from the dream-like, vivid appearances of the intermediate existence to see forms clearly.

Within that home of the intermediate existence, they will feel joyous and, as they run from one object to the next, they draw closer to their rebirth. Outside this place, they will then perceive, as if in a dream, the tuneful melodies of women singing and dancing, dressed in beautiful garments. They will also behold men singing and dancing.

What are the signs that manifest in such cases? What signs manifest to the mind of such beings at the end of their lives? Mighty ones, when starving spirits are about to die and be reborn in the higher realms, they will experience a decrease in their physical torments from hunger and thirst, and their minds will be less disturbed by envy and stinginess. Their constant yearning and craving for food and drink will grow less intense, and they will no longer have to run around in constant pursuit of food and drink. Their bodies will cool and no longer feel as rigid. Their hair will not be as long and ugly as before, and the worms that otherwise fill their bodies will be destroyed.

Still, merely seeing the food does make them happy. Just as one may recognize actual forms as one awakens from sleep, so these beings will now begin to witness the wondrous objects of the higher realms. Then, as they rush toward all these attractive sights, they will think, “I must lay hold of all those objects.” As soon as they begin to enjoy these objects, they are reborn.

All the many types of animals possess copious stupidity, and, based on their past karmic actions that are to be experienced in other lives, they live billions of such lives, experiencing the flawed karmic actions associated with hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. To live for many eons in cyclic existence, propelled by karmic actions in this way, is excruciating and extremely hard to fathom. As beings are caught in this process since time without beginning, they are helplessly compelled to wander further. It is indeed hard to believe that the flawed actions associated with the countless types of animals and their numerous foods, realms, bodies, abodes, mental seeds, and activities could possibly ever come to an end. Just as it is hard to believe that the ocean could dry up by extracting one drop of water at a time, so indeed is it incredible that the ocean of karmic actions could be emptied one drop at a time. {{page:{number:995,id:UT22084-068-021-101022,folio:F.262.a,volume:V69}}}

That hell beings can be born in the higher realms is actually less of a wonder than the fact that starving spirits and animals can also be born there. Why is that? Because the state of mind of a starving spirit or an animal is duller than that of a hell being, and they carry out numerous misdeeds against other beings. Thus, they may, in a single life, tie themselves to many hundreds of thousands of such lives lasting altogether hundreds, thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of eons. In this way, their chains of karmic action extend from life to life. It is therefore better to be born in hell than it is to take birth among starving spirits or animals.

It will witness the appearance of a mountain that is draped with vines and filled with waterfalls. It will also perceive caches of its regular foods upon that mountain. Whatever its conventional mind may have considered desirable and pleasant it will now behold on that mountain. Then, as if in a dream, it will experience running to that mountain for the sake of food or in order to dwell there, and the farther it runs, the closer it comes to its next birth.

Why is that? Because the nature of that sight is so different from anything it has otherwise been used to. It is so overwhelming that, as it watches these things, it will even wonder whether to go there at all. However, due to the conditions of its past positive actions, it will also feel, “I should take possession of all that.” As soon as that wish occurs, it will be born into the world of the gods.

As that happens, they may be reborn in indescribable happiness. Once beings in the great hells, such as the Reviving Hell, Black Line Hell, Crushing Hell, Howling Hell, Great Howling Hell, and Hell of Heat—where the ripening of hellish experiences, such as the blazing fires, is intensely hot and said to make one’s hair stand on end—pass from those hell realms and, in dying, exhaust that karma, what signs of dying will occur? How will they be born and die, passing from one existence to another? And how does the conditioning effect of karma cause them to experience great suffering or great happiness?
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1656,id:UT22084-068-021-4174}}}“ ‘Mighty ones, when hell beings die, exhausting their time in lower realms, they can die by experiencing being put into a clay vessel. Just by being placed there, they will evaporate like foam, and will not again take birth in another body in hell. They may also be killed with a hammer, in which case they will also not be born again in another body once they have died. They may also enter a valley and, just by entering it, their life force will be destroyed, and they will not be born again in another such body. They may also be plunged into acid and, as they dissolve, they will not be born again in another body. They may also be struck by spikes, in which case their injuries cause them to die and they will not again be born with a body in hell. {{page:{number:998,id:UT22084-068-021-101025,folio:F.263.b,volume:V69}}} If they are caught and consumed by vultures or ravens, they may likewise not be born there again.

When the sun sets in Jambudvīpa, darkness rises. Likewise, when past karma is exhausted, the manifestations with ugly faces and complexions will also disappear. If a wall collapses, the mural painted upon it is also destroyed. Likewise, when the wall of karma collapses, the awful henchmen of the Lord of Death, who are not considered to be real sentient beings, will also be destroyed.

Caressing their bodies, it brings great relief, a wonderful scent, and it feels very pleasant to be in. The breeze also produces a pleasing sound, which is like the sound of a tamboura or another such stringed instrument. They also notice a very pleasant scent. Moreover, they behold truly pleasing forms. Thus, they encounter forests, parks, ponds, cascades, and large lotus ponds with sweet scents. They hear the delightful sounds of singing. They see their own appearances as great, splendid, and adorned with extraordinarily sweet-smelling flower garlands.

They will wish, “May I be born there! May I have these things!” As soon they have this thought, they will take birth there. The reason they are linked to such an existence is that this existence arises conditioned by grasping. In this way, beings are freed from the hell realms and freed from their past negative deeds, and they therefore achieve indescribable happiness.

They will have the sense that everything is collapsing upon them. They will try to stop the falling mountain with their hands. Thus, they will clench their fists and move their arms back and forth and, as they do so, their companions will say that they are grasping at the sky. After this, they will perceive a white sheet, and then a red sheet.

Seeing each other as endearing and full of extraordinary qualities, they will regard each other as friends with whom they can freely enjoy themselves and celebrate.

Yet, as suddenly as the light appeared, it will disappear, just like a shooting star that suddenly flashes in the sky above Jambudvīpa, terrifying those that live there.

Once their karma is exhausted and they fall from that state, they fall for hundreds of thousands of leagues, and their radiance grows dimmer. When they die, their light in the sky dims just as the light of a butter lamp will dim and shed less light when it is running dry.

Compared to others, the karmic results of the gods in Free from Strife represent a tripling, whereas the gods in the Thirty-Three only constitute a doubling.” These things I heard from the Thus-Gone One, and I have related them to you.

{{milestone:{label:4.B.1760,id:UT22084-068-021-4307}}}“As the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects continues to examine the realm of the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing and so correctly perceive a god realm known as Garland of Splendor. Wondering what karmic actions allow beings to be born there, he will examine this matter with knowledge derived from hearing. He will then see how people who are virtuous and good create the merit that yields birth among the gods. Such people are virtuous and honest, do not harm others, understand the sacred Dharma, {{page:{number:1025,id:UT22084-068-021-101052,folio:F.277.a,volume:V69}}} wish to benefit all beings, and are guided by an authentic view, and their minds are always respectful of the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha. People whose minds are permeated by such qualities will create the merit to be born there.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1761,id:UT22084-068-021-4308}}} “What forms does this generation of merit take? If a monastic residence or stūpa falls into disrepair, they repair it. They will reinforce dwellings or stūpas or likewise repair their foundation. Or, should fire break out among valuables belonging to the Buddha, a stūpa, or the saṅgha, they will enter the fire with no concern for their own lives to put it out, rescuing the valuables from the flames. Or should people be threatened with fire, they will rescue them from the flames out of their caring compassion for beings. Such are ways they create merit.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1762,id:UT22084-068-021-4309}}} “What forms will their turning away from killing and stealing assume? If they are traveling along a road and find a piece of gold or silver, a precious substance, or some other valuable that has fallen by the wayside, they will ask, ‘Hey! Whose is this? Hey! Whose is this?’ If someone says, ‘This is mine,’ and it is indeed theirs, they will give it to them. If nobody wants it and nobody says anything, they will keep it for seven days. Then they will call upon the king or a high minister who resides in that place, so that the item may be advertised and not stolen. If at that time there is a risk that it may be stolen by unrighteous people, they will not call upon anyone and instead respectfully offer the item to the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha. This is how they refrain from stealing.

Once born there, they will be immersed in and endowed with tremendous pleasures. Experiencing the result of their own past actions, the bliss that they enjoy defies description. To nevertheless give some sort of indication, it may be said that this realm is totally ablaze with light. The distinctive quality of this light, however, is that although it resembles the light of the sun and is seen in a similar way, the light is not as hard to look at, because this light shines due to the gods’ past actions, which lead to happiness.

Within groves of broad-leaf trees that constantly flower, beautified by flocks of birds that continuously sing sweet songs, they see and hear pleasing sense objects and attend to them with their eyes and ears. Within such groves they see trees called opening and shutting eyes—trees that appear to have eyes that open and shut.

Relishing the tunes, they will approach the arriving gods, and when they see them they will become astonished and hurry before them.

The joyous groups of laughing and dancing gods and goddesses will then return and look at those who remain engaged in paying each other heartfelt respect.

Still at a great distance from the grove, they will see how it shines, as if it were the sun, ablaze with exquisite light. Upon seeing this grove, the newly born gods will be overwhelmed by waves of joy and hasten to that place. {{page:{number:1028,id:UT22084-068-021-101055,folio:F.278.b,volume:V69}}} There they will find four times as many delights as there are in any other forest.

Once they have indulged in the bliss of divine passion there, they will proceed to the mountain peaks called Lofty Mound. Singing songs, dancing, smiling, and carousing, these gods and goddesses who are all mutually congenial and caring, and fond of and never harmful to one another, will find extraordinary happiness. They will climb the many peaks of Lofty Mound, a mountain that is replete with all good qualities and adorned with various waterfalls, {{page:{number:1029,id:UT22084-068-021-101056,folio:F.279.a,volume:V69}}} pools, ponds, and divine lotus groves filled with gorgeous flowers.

Have all been explained by Śakra in his Dharma teaching.
Yet, the gods pay no attention.

He is the principal god.
Although he enjoys lotuses,
He nonetheless spurns evil deeds.

He is like a father to the gods.
Yet, in their carelessness, their minds are turbulent,
And thus these deluded beings fail to hold to his words.’
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1826,id:UT22084-068-021-4377}}}“The gods hear all that is sung by the birds, but the nature of things causes their minds to become disturbed by carelessness, and so they do not grow disenchanted. Without giving any consideration to these matters, they will once again commence their enjoyment of the pleasures of the moment, with no awareness of anything else. In this fashion, this class of divine beings will continue to enjoy the five sense pleasures until finally their completed and accumulated positive acts that bring desirable, attractive, and delightful effects, and that are to be individually experienced, have been exhausted. Once that happens, they will die and leave their divine world, only to be born among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals, in accordance with their karmic actions. Should they instead be born with the general lot in life of a human, they will, in accordance with their causal actions, always have the finest joys, possess supreme virtues and the finest enjoyments, have excellent bodies, and be loving toward all beings.

Thus, there are just these thirty-three realms of the gods, and not any other. This, also, is as far as Śakra’s power extends; he remains powerful only to this extent. These are the realms he enjoys, and not any other.
{{milestone:{label:4.B.1828,id:UT22084-068-021-4379}}}“The monk will in this way first examine these god realms, noticing the relations and similarities between cause and effect. With such perception of the effects of karmic actions, he will discern all the relevant factors. Thereby he will develop weariness with cyclic existence because he will clearly see death, transference, and rebirth; parting from the beloved and encountering the enemy; the precipices of aging, sickness, and death; and the way one is invariably plunged into myriad ghastly terrors. Directly seeing how every aspect involves numerous rivers of suffering and burning, he will think with overwhelming sorrow, ‘Alas! Our world is cycling through total misery. Everyone is falling over the fearsome precipices of birth, aging, sickness, and death. And yet, no one realizes this—nor does anyone have the means to go beyond cyclic existence. There is not the slightest bit that is pleasant, permanent, stable, enduring, or unchanging. Because childish beings are for the most part deluded about this, they do not understand what is going on, and thus they keep carrying out numerous misdeeds for the sake of their physical well-being. However, their bodies will be destroyed. The karma of their misdeeds, on the other hand, will keep following them.’

“ ‘By spoiling the body with bedding and seats,
One may end up entirely devastated.
Yet, the body will not do anything in return
For the one who so skillfully serves it.

While constantly searching for a way to strike,
How could the learned commit negative deeds
For the sake of their enemy—the body?

Its numerous inner flaws and futility,

The body behaves in this way.

Abiding upon this distinct, eighteenth ground, he will be weary of cyclic existence, practice with the intent to transcend suffering, {{page:{number:1039,id:UT22084-068-021-101066,folio:F.284.a,volume:V69}}} and have no desire for the domain of the māras. When they come to know of this, the celestial gods will inform the heavenly gods, who in turn will pass the news to the four guardians of the world. The latter will inform the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, who will tell the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. From there the news will pass to the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife, and in this way eventually reach the gods in Luminosity.”
