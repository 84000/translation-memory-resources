Prologue
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-27}} {{page:{number:1,folio:F.158.a}}} I prostrate to the Blue-Clad Blessed Vajrapāṇi! I prostrate to the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the three times!
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-28}} Thus have I heard at one time. Blessed Akṣobhya, the buddha of the vajra family, was residing in the palace in Alakāvatī together with a retinue of millions of bodhisattvas, including Vajrapāṇi, {{page:{number:2,folio:F.158.b}}} Vajra Regiment, Constant Vajra Holder, Vajra Tamer, Terrible Vajra Conqueror, Vajra Tamer of All Evil, Vajra Victor of Basic Space, Vajra Joyfully Abiding Protector, and others.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-29}} At that time, the great being, the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi himself, brandished a vajra three times at his heart center. He made three circumambulations of the Blessed One and prostrated himself.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-30}} Then, kneeling on his right knee, Vajrapāṇi requested, “Blessed One, Thus-Gone One, Great Vajra Holder, please explain the great tantra called The All-Subjugating Vajra that subjugates all bhūtas and that tames the evil ones that dwell beneath the earth. Great Vajra Holder, I supplicate you to teach! Great Lord of All, I supplicate you to teach! Great Tamer of All Evil Forces, I supplicate you to teach! Great Dispeller of All Darkness, I supplicate you to teach!”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-31}} At this request from Vajrapāṇi, the Blessed One declared, “It is excellent that you, Great Vajradhara, Secret One, have, for the benefit of sentient beings, requested from me the tantra called The All-Subjugating Vajra . Lord of Secrets, that is excellent! Great Bodhisattva, that is excellent! Thus, you who share Vajrapāṇi’s lineage, listen and remember this! I will reveal and explain the tantra called The Vajra that Subjugates the Evil Forces Below the Vajra Earth . Receive it!”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-32}} After pronouncing these words, the Blessed One, by means of the absorption of the all-subjugating vajra, entered equipoise in the absorption called vanquishing all grahas and bhūtas from below the earth.
No sooner had the Blessed One entered equipoise than a multitude of wrathful subjugators of evil forces emanated from all the pores of his body and filled the space under the earth, on the earth, and above the earth. The entire land of the underground nāgas was filled with the horrible sound hūṃ. {{page:{number:3,folio:F.159.a}}} The eight nāga kings together with their retinues were tamed, and bowed before the Blessed One.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-33}} But the nāga king Anantaka then gave rise to an evil thought, intending to release a scalding breath. But the Blessed One knew his intention and blessed the Lord of Secrets, Vajrapāṇi, who spoke this mantra called the mantra that completely pacifies the anger of all nāgas : “ Oṃ nīlavajra krodhanāga hūṃ phaṭ .”
Now the mind of the nāga Anantaka was completely pacified; he became endowed with the awakened mind, through which the minds of all the nāgas were completely pacified. Then all of the nāga kings like Anantaka, who live below the earth, supplicated the Blessed One, the Great Vajra Holder, with these words:
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-34}} “Blessed One, we supplicate you to explain a ritual that will, in future times and onward, prevent the grahas that are living below the earth from making obstacles for sentient beings, and that will also pacify the evil of those spirits. We supplicate you to explain why we, the nāga kings and our retinues, are unable to create obstacles for that great being. We supplicate you to explain to us, the nāga kings, our purpose.”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-35}} The Blessed One, the Great Vajra Holder, glanced at the nāga kings and replied, “Nāga kings, that is excellent! Your request is timely. I will reveal this for the benefit of sentient beings. I will explain; listen!”
The nāgas and the others replied, “Excellent, Blessed One!”
They then listened appropriately. At that point, the Blessed One explained the following chapter called “Taming the Nāgas.”
Taming the Nāgas
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-36}} Hūṃ! For the benefit of all sentient beings, The Teacher, the Great Vajra Holder, Carefully observed his own retinue, Projected light into all directions, And then taught the method for destroying all grahas:
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-37}} “On the eighth day of the waxing moon, Or likewise on the fourteenth and fifteenth days, In an extremely isolated place, Contemplate wrathful Vajrapāṇi, Youthful and with majestic poise. {{page:{number:4,folio:F.159.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-38}} “Next, purify gold and so forth, the seven precious things, And place these in a jeweled vessel or clay pot. Recite 108 mantras.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-39}} “Resorting to the true utterance of the Three Jewels, Give an oblation to the bhūtas. Bury it in firm ground wherever they abide, And the bhūtas and evil nāgas will be pacified.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-40}} “When these peaceful methods are not sufficient, With terrible weapons Set their homes ablaze.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-41}} “This fierce, unbearable suffering Will remind them of their previous intentions, And they will undoubtedly be pacified.”

The Tantra of the Blue-Clad Blessed Vajrapāṇi
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-42}} Then the Blessed One explained the ritual for the action deity:
“Always in possession of the awakened mind, And endowed with all commitments and vows, Engage in all of the acts of bathing.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-43}} “In a clean and pure place, Beautify the maṇḍala as is fitting. Visualize an iron hook that emerges from the syllable hūṃ, Bringing the buddhas and bodhisattvas instantaneously before you. Make offerings and so forth to them.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-44}} “Oṃ śūnyatā­jñāna­vajra­svabhāvātmako 'haṃ Meditate on the absorption of emptiness.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-45}} “In the expanse of space, visualize the letter āḥ, And the first moon, the letter hūṃ Blazing with great light. This purifies the negative emotions of the six classes of beings, Definitively placing them in the state of complete liberation.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-46}} “Imagine the light gathered back in the form of hūṃ Marked with a five-pronged vajra. A garland of light shines forth from this, Causing all sentient beings To dissolve into the vajra essence.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-47}} “From this the Great Wrathful One Blue in color, blazes forth. Seated with his left leg extended, he is sixteen years of age. He is adorned with eight ornaments, Anantaka, and so forth.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-48}} “His form is dark in color, With one face and two hands, holding a vajra. His clothing is blue and luminous, His three eyes are beautifully red and looking upward. His dreadlocks stream upward Bound by a vajra ornament—imagine him like this.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-49}} “Then great wrathful wisdom Is invoked and ushered in with jaḥ hūṃ vaṃ hoḥ
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-50}} “Visualize, at his head, throat, and heart center, A wheel, a lotus, and a vajra Marked by the syllables oṃ āḥ hūṃ, {{page:{number:5,folio:F.160.a}}} Ornamented with the thirteen-syllable mantra.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-51}} “Visualize that Akṣobhya-Vajra confers empowerment, And all is conquered and perfectly purified.”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-52}} Then the Blessed One resolutely spoke his root mantra, the statement of all activity: “ Oṃ nīlāmbara­dhara­vajra­pāṇi hūṃ hūṃ phaṭ.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-53}} “The garlands of mantra as well Should be white for peaceful, red for magnetizing, Yellow for increasing, and black for wrathful activity. Completely abandon thoughts and recite this.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-54}} “With the distinct techniques of emanating and absorbing, Engage in concentration on whatever you wish for. Give up the practice of what you do not desire.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-55}} “The wrathful king Vajrapāṇi Will benefit this mind, the support of all virtues, With whatever is striven for!
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-56}} “The stages such as Perfect Joy, And abilities such as invisibility, will be accomplished. The support of everything is virtuous And the supported is devoid of activity. {{note:{index:4,id:UT22084-087-003-282}}} The supreme attainment will be perfectly accomplished!”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-57}} This was the first chapter from “ The Glorious Tantra of the Vajra in the Underworld ,” “Accomplishing Peaceful Activity” or the “Chapter of the Gods.”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-58}} Then the great bodhisattva, the great being Vajrapāṇi, supplicated the Blessed One with these words:
“Blessed One, Teacher, Vajra Holder, Please explain the supreme ritual For the oblation that pacifies obstacles. Make this effort for the benefit of beings!”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-59}} Then the Blessed One said:
“Excellent, principal Vajra Holder! I will explain the basis of all oblations: The ritual for pacifying obstacles, And the ritual that is a method for gaining spiritual accomplishment.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-60}} “In a beautiful vessel, Place many excellent articles Such as food, drink, and so forth.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-61}} “Through entering the absorption of emptiness, From bruṃ generate a beautiful vessel. With kham visualize food and drink Filling all of space, and recite this mantra: Oṃ āḥkāro mukhaṃ sarva­dharmāṇām ādyanta­panna tathā oṃ āḥ hūṃ phaṭ svāhā.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-62}} “Visualizing it as nectar, expand it greatly. Through two expansions, purify it. In space, from the letter hrīḥ Visualize eight lotuses, immeasurably large. {{page:{number:6,folio:F.160.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-63}} “Then invite the protector Vaiśravaṇa, The central figure surrounded by a retinue of ten million yakṣas, The recipient of the offerings of the eight nāga kings.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-64}} “Imagine that the yakṣa kings— Jambhala and Pūrṇabhadra, Maṇibhadra, Kubera, Samprajñāna, Guhyasthāna, Pāñcika, And Bījakuṇḍalī— Gather round the central figure like a retinue In all the main and intermediate directions.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-65}} “The common retinue of ten million Are behind the eight nāgas and yakṣas. Next, for the invitation, use hooks That are conjoined from the central deity.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-66}} “Imagine them on mounts of lions and horses, All with one face and two hands, With victory banners, blazing with gems And the vase of precious jewels.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-67}} “They hold swords blazing with gems, Daggers and spears, celestial chariots, swords, and shields, And various weaponry raised on high; visualize them thus.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-68}} “At the time of invitation, offer drum And trumpet music, fruits and incense.
“Oṃ vaiśravaṇa saparivāra samāja jaḥ hūṃ vaṃ hoḥ Oṃ ve svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇa ākarṣaya hūṃ jaḥ Is the mantra for the invitation.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-69}} “Oṃ amṛta­kuṇḍalī hana hana hūṃ phaṭ Is the mantra for dispelling obstructors.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-70}} “Then with flowers and so forth, Make pure offerings in the sky, Offering them with joy.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-71}} “Oṃ nīlāmbara­dhara­vajra­pāṇi ājñāpayati imaṃ baligṛhnantu Samayarakṣantu Mama sarva­siddhiṃ me prayacchantu mama karmāmogha svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇāyā svāhā Oṃ jambhalāya svāhā Oṃ pūrṇavhadrāya svāhā Oṃ maṇibhadrāya svāhā Oṃ kuberāya svāhā Oṃ samprajñānāya svāhā Oṃ guhyasthānāya svāhā Oṃ pāñcikāya svāhā Oṃ bījakuṇḍaline svāhā These are the mantras for offering the oblation.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-72}} “Then make that offering to the guests. Hooks of light rays shine forth, And immediately they arrive. Perform the ritual of equal enjoyment.”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-73}} This was the second chapter of “ The Tantra of the Vajra in the Underworld ,” “The Oblation.”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-74}} Then, for the benefit of those who wish to attain worldly accomplishment, the Blessed One entered the absorption called the origination of all worldly wheels {{page:{number:7,folio:F.161.a}}} and emanated rays of light from the pores of his body. Vaiśravaṇa and his retinue were thus inspired and gathered around him. He prostrated to the Blessed One, scattered dust made from precious gems, and made this request:
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-75}} “Blessed One, I am the Dharma-upholding king named Vaiśravaṇa. If I myself were to proclaim a secret in order to protect the Dharma of the pious and ensure that the Dharma abides for a long time, would the Blessed One grant me an opportunity?”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-76}} The Blessed One said, “Great King, excellent! Explain your secret well! I rejoice and give my blessings. May all vajra holders also bless you. Speak well!”
Then Vaiśravaṇa got up from his seat, prostrated to the Blessed One, and spoke his own incantation: “ Oṃ vaiśravaṇāya hūṃ hūṃ paca paca chinda chinda svāhā.”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-77}} Once he had spoken these words, he requested the Blessed One, “O Blessed One, the accomplishment of this, my mantra, is excellent. Whoever wants to accomplish my state of being should arrange great offerings in the three times. To make the offering to me and my retinue, the practitioner should remain with one-pointed concentration in an isolated place. A practitioner of the blessed Vajrapāṇi must recite my mantra ten thousand times, and then accomplish the activities. One who thus accomplishes my state of being and my activity should offer an oblation and make vast offerings to me and to my retinue. The mantra to recite for making vast offerings and offering the oblation to me and my retinue is this:
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-78}} “Oṃ vaiśravaṇāya svāhā Oṃ jambhalāya svāhā Oṃ pūrṇabhadrāya svāhā Oṃ maṇibhadrāya svāhā Oṃ kuberāya svāhā Oṃ samprajñānāya svāhā Oṃ guhyasthānāya svāhā Oṃ pāñcikāya svāhā {{page:{number:8,folio:F.161.b}}} Oṃ bījakuṇḍaline svāhā
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-79}} “Know that these are the mantras both for making offerings and giving an oblation to me and my retinue.
“Then, with respect to accomplishing my activity, I requested the Blessed One to bless me with his explanation. The explanation of the activity is this:
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-80}} “Whoever wishes to gain accomplishment Must know the stages Of killing, the burnt offering, and the suppression ritual.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-81}} “Make an effigy out of beeswax Of the target—those hostile toward the teachings. Draw him, make him enter, and then take control.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-82}} “The eighteen-syllable mantra Forcefully strikes down in the three times, And suddenly his spirit is broken. There is no doubt that the target will be slain.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-83}} “If one is practicing the burnt offerings From among peaceful, increasing, magnetizing, and wrathful activities, Here one should perform liberation wrathfully. Thoroughly burn with a blazing fire. {{note:{index:5,id:UT22084-087-003-275}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-84}} “With respect to the superior, average, and inferior hearth, Construct the superior one in three measures, the average in two, And the inferior in whatever measure is possible.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-85}} “With fuel of thorny wood, Great wrath is accomplished. Burn dough and mustard seeds in the fire; Dissolve the body, speech, and mind of the aggressor Into the substances, and make the burnt offering.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-86}} “Imagine the retinue of yakṣas in the fire And present them with the burnt substances, Or scatter the activity-fire yakṣas with the substances. {{note:{index:6,id:UT22084-087-003-276}}} However you do it, it will be accomplished.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-87}} “At that time, also, with these words of praise Focus your mind one-pointedly and offer praise:
“Hūṃ! All-conquering, terrifying yakṣa and the rest, Terrorizing with your noxious brilliant heat, Bellowing loudly with wrathful splendor. Homage and praise to you and your retinue!
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-88}} “Oṃ vaiśravaṇa puṣpe hūṃ svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇa dhupe hūṃ svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇa dīpaṃ hūṃ svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇa gandhe hūṃ svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇa naivedye hūṃ svāhā
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-89}} “Worship the central deity and also his retinue; Make offerings in sequence. Recite, spreading secret mantras; Perform the projection and reabsorption. This is the ordinary form of propagation.
“Oṃ vaiśravaṇaya chegemo māraya phaṭ svāhā {{page:{number:9,folio:F.162.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-90}} “For the retinue, just as for the main deity, Worship them with their own incantations. Fully supported by incantations, Imagine that they crush them into dust.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-91}} “Enjoin them to perform activity and give an oblation. As for the stages of sprinkling and offering the oblation, Offer them in order. The sequence for the peaceful activity is as follows:
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-92}} “On a hearth of sufficient size, Offer the burning substances and so forth. Having conquered the evil deeds of body, speech, and mind, Transform them into the essence of wisdom fire.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-93}} “Discard the vessel and the hearth. Completely burn all grahas there, And also make a ransom rite to pacify the great obstructors. In order to increase and magnetize For the activity and specific stages, Know that the details of the shape of the hearth Are in accordance with the previously explained activities.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-94}} “As for the substantial offering, With the stages of red and yellow firewood and so forth:
“Oṃ vaiśravaṇāya dhanapuṣṭiṃ kuru ye svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇa vaśaṃ kuru svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇāye śāntiṃ kuru svāhā
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-95}} “Just as for the main deity, for the retinue also Make offerings with the incantatory substances. Offer the burned substances of dough, Mustard seeds, sweets, and so forth in sequence.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-96}} “The four activities are perfectly accomplished. With superior diligence, they are fully accomplished. With middling and lesser diligence, know that They are accomplished in a middling and lesser way.”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-97}} Then Vaiśravaṇa and his retinue declared to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, whoever engages in the practices that we have explained here should continually worship the Blessed Vajrapāṇi and the yakṣas with the three white substances. He must completely avoid alcohol. He must acquire meats that are suitable and auspicious. {{note:{index:7,id:UT22084-087-003-277}}} If we fail to accomplish, properly and one-pointedly, the activities that are our accomplishments, then we will have insulted the Blessed One and we will have failed to protect the Dharma. This is our oath. Oṃ vaiśravaṇa arthakathama .” {{page:{number:10,folio:F.162.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-98}} “Great Vaiśravaṇa, that is excellent. So very excellent!” said the Blessed One. “So very excellent! The secret of which you have spoken will be of great benefit for the people of the future. In order that their benefit will certainly be accomplished, I also will pronounce this mantra. Listen!”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-99}} “Excellent!” said Vaiśravaṇa and the others to the Blessed One, and listened accordingly.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-100}} The Blessed One then said, “ Oṃ vajrapāṇi nīlāmbara­dhara vajrasphoṭa hūṃ phaṭ svāhā . This incantation is a mantra that brings control over activities. Great Vaiśravaṇa brings about possession of the secret just as he promised.”
“That is so,” said the yakṣas, and vanished.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-101}} This was the third chapter of “ The Tantra of the Vajra in the Underworld ,” the chapter on Vaiśravaṇa.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-102}} Then, once again, the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi requested the Blessed One, “Lord, for the sake of sentient beings of the future, please teach a wheel that strikes all wicked ones!”
The Blessed One mentally consented to this request, yet remained completely silent. Instead he projected an all-pervading light from his heart center that embraced all sentient beings with love.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-103}} Then he told Vajrapāṇi, “Vajrapāṇi, I shall now teach a wheel that strikes the obstructors within the ground below. So listen one-pointedly, and I will teach.”
Vajrapāṇi listened accordingly, and the Blessed One began to speak:
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-104}} “Whoever wishes to construct such a diagram Should go to pleasant and solitary places And perform the practice of Vajrapāṇi. Visualize the world and its contents as Vajracaṇḍa.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-105}} “From the element of wind up until the central mountain, Imagine it to consist of enlightened bodies as numerous as there are particles. Amid this, cultivate the practice of Vajrapāṇi. His feet are placed on the holder of the hare.

{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-109}} “With his hand, he strikes with the vajra; Like a bolt shot from a crossbow, it strikes down. Hūṃ hūṃ resounds like thunder; They are thoroughly suppressed by his voice.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-110}} “Act like that, and all will be accomplished; Karmic torment will come to an end. If one does not know Vajrapāṇi, Other accomplishments will be inferior.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-111}} “Whatever is accomplished hereby accomplishes all— In particular, the supreme and the common.”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-112}} This was the fourth chapter on the wheel of suppression from “ The Tantra of the Vajra in the Underworld .”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-113}} Then, at another time, the Vajra Holder Taught the ritual of the diagram:
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-114}} “On a piece of birch bark or rind, Draw a wheel With twenty-one sections. Commence this on the waxing phase of the moon,

{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-117}} “On the twelve outer sections Are the twelve syllables, omitting oṃ. On these the secret mantra is as follows:
Nīlāmbara­dhara­vajra­pāṇi hūṃ phaṭ.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-118}} “This completed wheel Should be rolled up and fixed to the heart center of the target; It should be rolled up from the front edge. Then the fire-offering ritual should be performed.
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-119}} “If one wishes to subdue, The diagram should be completed as before. At the end, perform the ritual of subjugation. Place the diagram in a fresh clay cup And draw a crossed vajra on the lid. Closing it with clay, Temples and the like can be suppressed.

{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-123}} “Just like dry grass being burnt up by flames, The person will be unable to remain.”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-124}} This was the fifth chapter on the ritual for drawing the diagram from “ The Glorious Tantra of the Vajra in the Underworld .”
{{milestone:UT22084-087-003-125}} Then, once again, Vajrapāṇi asked the Blessed One, “Lord, since everything is the domain of the profound, does one get liberated through such rituals as fire offerings, or not? Please clear away my doubts!”
The Blessed One replied:
