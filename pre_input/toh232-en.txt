Devadatta is a great being who demonstrates the Tathāgata’s virtuous qualities. Devadatta, the group of six monks, and their followers completely establish tens of millions of sentient beings in meritorious behavior. Great brahmin, no sentient beings are capable of drawing the blood of a tathāgata, foe-destroyer, complete and perfect buddha.

Sentient beings such as these obtain the treasury of delighting in the Dharma.

{{milestone:{label:37.112,id:UT22084-064-002-632}}}Then, out of the great assembly rose a devaputra named Gandharva King Delightful Appearance. He prostrated, touching his head to the Bhagavān’s feet, and then addressed the Bhagavān, saying, “Ah, Bhagavān! After the Tathāgata passes into nirvāṇa, who will be able to bear in mind such tathāgatas as these and such discourses as these? What kinds of sentient beings will be able to maintain them? What kinds of sentient beings will cause them to disappear?”
{{milestone:{label:37.113,id:UT22084-064-002-633}}}Then, through the Buddha’s power, the venerable Mahākāśyapa addressed the devaputra Gandharva King Delightful Appearance, saying, “Noble child, there is no passing into parinirvāṇa for any of the tathāgata, foe-destroyer, complete and perfect buddhas, {{page:{number:145,id:UT22084-064-002-1608,folio:F.185.a}}} and the Dharma will not disappear.”

{{milestone:{label:37.115,id:UT22084-064-002-635}}}At these words, the elder Mahākāśyapa replied to the devaputra Gandharva King Delightful Appearance, saying, “Friend, the bodies of the tathāgatas are Dharma bodies. The bodies of the tathāgatas are as hard as vajras. The bodies of the tathāgatas are endowed with all virtues. Friend, the bodies of the tathāgatas are not flesh bodies, because they are bodies of skillful means. Noble child, how could bodies such as the tathāgatas’ bodies pass into parinirvāṇa?

{{milestone:{label:37.122,id:UT22084-064-002-642}}}When Mahākāśyapa gave this explanation, one million two hundred thousand devaputras produced the aspiration to attain unsurpassed, complete, and perfect awakening. With joyful minds, they uttered these verses together in a single voice:

Chapter 38
{{milestone:{label:38.1,id:UT22084-064-002-646}}}At that time, a host of devaputras arrived from the Obsidian Mountain in the southern lands. Together with Mahākāśyapa, they ascended into empty space, hovering at a distance equal to the height of seven tala trees. From there, they scattered flower petals down upon the Tathāgata, piling up layers of petals as high as Mount Meru. Thereupon, their eyes filled with tears, and with voices wailing they addressed the Bhagavān, saying, “Alas, Bhagavān! When the Tathāgata {{page:{number:147,id:UT22084-064-002-1610,folio:F.186.a}}} has passed into parinirvāṇa out of skillful means, what sorts of sentient beings will arise to maintain those discourses such as this one, which were spoken by the Tathāgata?”
{{milestone:{label:38.2,id:UT22084-064-002-647}}}The Bhagavān replied, “Devaputras, after I am gone, those who have produced virtuous roots and those who have paid veneration to many buddhas will maintain the discourses such as this and extensively teach them to others. This Great Cloud discourse will circulate within Jambudvīpa for forty years and become widespread. At a later time, people will abandon the sacred Dharma, rulers will breed conflicts, and the sacred Dharma will disappear. At that time, there will be monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen who no longer train their bodies, train in discipline, train their minds, and train in wisdom. Lacking in wisdom and stupid as sheep, when those with completely impaired wisdom hear the explanations of discourses such as this one, they will not believe it. Laughing at it, criticizing it, and deriding it, they will meet in private to repeat their slander among themselves. With derisive thoughts, they will say of those who teach this discourse,{{note:{index:35,id:UT22084-064-002-648}}} ‘Amazing! These monks are foolish and speak nonsense. Whatever they say was not spoken by the Buddha. Those are just the words of people skilled in composition, who write various words, circulate these writings within their own circles, and then go out and proclaim them. Discourses such as these were not spoken by the Buddha.’ Thus, there will arise ignorant people like these, with little merit, lacking in wisdom, stupid as sheep, their wisdom impaired, who will disparage the sacred Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:38.3,id:UT22084-064-002-649}}}“Furthermore, devaputras, there will appear monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen with little merit, weak wisdom, lack of wisdom, dull wisdom, little wisdom, {{page:{number:148,id:UT22084-064-002-1611,folio:F.186.b}}} and completely impaired wisdom who have not rendered service to the conquerors of the past, who have completely deviated from the precious and unsurpassed Dharma, who have forever become outsiders to the precious Dharma, who have completely abandoned the precious Dharma, who have few virtuous roots, who are famished bald-heads, and who are rough and difficult to tame. There will appear monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen{{note:{index:36,id:UT22084-064-002-650}}} who keep male and female servants. There will appear some who keep gold and jewels. There will appear some who keep shells, crystals, and coral. There will appear some who keep cattle and water buffalo. There will appear some who keep fields and property. There will appear some who keep breeding grounds for ducks, chickens, pigs, and the like. There will appear some who engage in the sixteen great inexpiable occupations. There will appear some who serve kings. There will appear some who serve as messengers. There will appear some who compound poisons. There will appear some who engage in all sorts of activities that are inappropriate for monks.
{{milestone:{label:38.4,id:UT22084-064-002-651}}}“At that time, when ignorant people such as these are flourishing and the sacred Dharma is in complete decline, a monk like Mahākāśyapa will appear in Jambudvīpa. He will go forth to renunciation among my disciples. Gradually, among all those rough and difficult-to-tame, famished bald-heads, he will praise those discourses spoken by the Tathāgata. Risking his own life, he will praise everything from vows according to the pratimokṣa down to the basic precepts. After that, he will praise sitting under trees. Similarly, he will praise wearing rags, abiding in the wilderness, and observing discipline, and he will expel those who are undisciplined. Devaputras, you must guard my disciple who develops faith in the Great Vehicle, the monk who desires the Dharma{{note:{index:37,id:UT22084-064-002-652}}} and abides in loving-kindness!”

Bhagavān, through the Buddha’s power we will subjugate evil Māra. We will banish all those rough and difficult-to-tame, famished bald-heads to those lands where the Dharma is nonexistent.”
{{milestone:{label:38.6,id:UT22084-064-002-654}}}The Bhagavān replied, “Devaputras, it is excellent, excellent, that you have made such vows and aspirations. That sacred being, the monk who desires the Dharma, will be protected by all the gods, and all the gods will praise him. The Tathāgata will also praise him, thinking, ‘That disciple of mine has undertaken hardship.’ ” 
{{milestone:{label:38.7,id:UT22084-064-002-655}}}The Bhagavān then further addressed the devaputras, saying, “Devaputras, those noble children who desire benefit for sentient beings will guard the sacred Dharma.”
{{milestone:{label:38.8,id:UT22084-064-002-656}}}At this point, all the many devaputras covered the Bhagavān with jeweled umbrellas and addressed him, saying, “Bhagavān, when will the Tathāgata’s son, the monk who is like Mahākāśyapa, arise? Where will he be born? By what name will he be known?”
{{milestone:{label:38.9,id:UT22084-064-002-657}}}The Bhagavān replied, “Devaputras, many hundreds of years after I am gone, in the southern region there will appear a ruler of a stronghold who is named Joyful Conduct.{{note:{index:38,id:UT22084-064-002-658}}} At that time, the sacred Dharma will have been in decline for eighty years, leaving behind only minute traces. Then, my disciple will appear. He will bestow the sacred Dharma, turn the wheel of Dharma, and extensively expound the Great Vehicle to others. After having heard explanations of discourses such as this, those who have heard of those complete and perfect buddhas of the past will, in this future time, uphold these discourses,{{note:{index:39,id:UT22084-064-002-659}}} realize them, bear them in mind, recite them, {{page:{number:150,id:UT22084-064-002-1613,folio:F.187.b}}} and trust in them. Those sentient beings who, when they hear the names of these tathāgatas, do not trust in them, do not develop faith in them, do not chant them, do not recite them, and do not inquire about them will have fallen under the magical power of Māra. However, those sentient beings who, when they hear the names of these tathāgatas, trust in them, develop faith in them, chant them, recite them, and inquire about them will be fully supported by many buddhas.”
{{milestone:{label:38.10,id:UT22084-064-002-660}}}At that time, the devaputra Gandharva King Delightful Appearance circumambulated the Bhagavān one million times and then prostrated, touching his head to the Bhagavān’s feet. He then addressed the Bhagavān, saying, “Bhagavān, regarding that monk who is like Mahākāśyapa, who is named after the Tathāgata, who abides in great loving-kindness, who strives fiercely toward great discipline, who is supremely handsome, who is born to a great family, who is surrounded by monks endowed with great discipline—when, in what town, and in what form will he appear? Bhagavān, I beseech you to explain this in detail. Bhagavān, I will guard that monk for as long as I live.”
{{milestone:{label:38.11,id:UT22084-064-002-661}}}The Bhagavān replied, “Gandharva King Delightful Appearance, listen to the prophecy of this monk. He will be devoted to me, he will cause my teachings to appear and bear their burden, and he will be a youth of my Śākya family. Gandharva King Delightful Appearance, after I am gone, in the southern region there will arise a land called Bald Ṛṣi, where there will emerge a meritorious town called Great Sands. In that town, there will be a river called Abundant Beauty. In a district on the northern side of that river a great pure merchant family will arise in a place called Kharjūrikā. In order to cause my Dharma to appear, the youth of the Śākya family, the Licchavi youth Admired by All Worlds,{{note:{index:40,id:UT22084-064-002-662}}} will be born into that great family {{page:{number:151,id:UT22084-064-002-1614,folio:F.188.a}}} as a supreme man and bodhisattva. His parents and relatives will name him after me. Thus, the great merchant family of Kharjūrikā should be viewed as the family of the Tathāgata.

The child named after the Tathāgata will be loved and venerated by all beings. When that child goes forth to renunciation, he will lead a retinue of celibate practitioners and a host of monks. Risking his own life to teach the sacred Dharma and to cause the conduct of the Tathāgata to appear, he will carry out the conduct that is supremely difficult. The companions of that monk who desires the sacred Dharma will abandon thinking of their own lives and will guard the sacred Dharma. That assembly of monks will engage in conduct that is exceedingly difficult. They will respect me and develop pure discipline, restraining themselves with the pratimokṣa vows. Their conduct and the domain of their conduct will be perfectly complete, and they will not have to worry about engaging in even the slightest of misdeeds. Whichever monks, nuns, laymen, or laywomen develop trust in the supremely difficult words of this disciple of mine should all be regarded as being just like Great Cloud Essence.

For the sake of the sacred Dharma, they will abandon thinking of their own lives. They will abandon their wealth and any thoughts of the lives of their own groups, including their sons, their wives, and their daughters. Having done so, they will enter into battle with the great army, complete their battle with the great army, and defeat the powerful forces of Māra, {{page:{number:152,id:UT22084-064-002-1615,folio:F.188.b}}} completely destroying the forces of Māra. They will firmly establish the sacred Dharma through all manner of skillful means and arouse the power of my sacred Dharma. These sentient beings will obtain that which is well obtained. They should be regarded as supreme beings and bodhisattvas. Those monks and nuns will become completely pure objects of generosity and will form a completely pure saṅgha. Those groups of laymen and laywomen will encounter the advent of buddhas. Although they will earnestly practice the sacred Dharma, Gandharva King Delightful Appearance, nevertheless those sentient beings who trust in the words of my disciple will be few; the vast majority will not develop conviction in them.

What are these four? They will have heard of this samādhi of the tide of the deep, constant ocean from many former buddhas in the past. They will be fully supported by spiritual friends. They will abide in the superior intention and will be supported by virtuous roots. They will directly manifest vast conviction with their bodies. Gandharva King Delightful Appearance, those who possess these four qualities will trust in the words of my disciple. You should know that those who do not trust in them are ignorant people who are under the enchanting power of Māra. You should know that any sentient beings who do develop trust in them will be fully supported by the myriad buddhas. Ah! These future sentient beings will encounter the advent of all the buddhas. How is this? This monk who is named after the Tathāgata will be completely supported by many buddhas because his companions will be utterly pure and will include the assembly of monks and nuns.

In past times, this disciple of mine engaged in the conduct that is difficult, and in the present, he again engages in the conduct that is difficult. King Great Diligent Nāga is now the present-day Licchavi youth Admired by All Worlds. You should know that this Licchavi youth will become the monk who is named after the Tathāgata.

Monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen who abandon thinking of their own lives and who support that one who desires to be a monk by providing him with basic supplies and housing will have offered to honor all the tathāgatas as gurus. Monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen who follow the instructions of that one who desires to be a monk will be carrying out the commands of all the tathāgatas.

He gives his own teachings on basic precepts that he himself fabricated and that were not spoken by the Buddha. Now, venerables, this monk is mistaken. Venerables, he says that we keep male and female servants, cows, and water buffalo, and that these should all be abandoned. This misguided monk thus claims that we should dedicate our lives, take up his positions, and then engage in the conduct that is extremely difficult. If whatever we do or give will only produce results experienced in this life and the next, then what should we do?’ Speaking in this way, they criticize him, and meeting together in private, they sow discord.

Thus, they will have adopted the position of all the practices of all the tathāgatas and established themselves in the sacred Dharma.

When those seven buddhas have gone on to parinirvāṇa, then at that time this world system will become known as Manifest Clarity. Within this world system of Manifest Clarity there will arise a bhagavān, tathāgata, foe-destroyer, complete and perfect buddha named Radiant Source of Gnosis. The sentient beings who dwell within that Tathāgata’s buddhafield will be beautiful and will have obtained clarity. At that time, all those who take the side of the sacred Dharma or cause the sacred Dharma to appear will take birth within this world system of Manifest Clarity. Having been born there, they will become supreme disciples of that bhagavān tathāgata Radiant Source of Gnosis, and they will all become bodhisattvas, supreme humans.

“She is not a woman. The goddess Stainless Light has performed the activities of a bodhisattva over countless tens of millions of eons.

He will give his daughter the name Abundant Harvest, to correspond with her virtuous qualities. Then, as the king Increasing Majesty’s merit is gradually exhausted, he will approach the time of his death. All the people from the city, its environs, and the entire land will gather, thinking, ‘Although the young prince is not capable of becoming king, this princess Abundant Harvest could herself be empowered as king, and the prince installed in the palace as king{{note:{index:73,id:UT22084-064-002-912}}} in name only.

With great parasols, banners, and victory banners adorned with all kinds of jewels, and with sandalwood powder infused with all manner of scents, incense, all sorts of flowers, drums, gongs, kettledrums, lutes, flutes, and hundreds of cymbals, she will make offerings to them, circulating all throughout Jambudvīpa. For the monks who possess discipline and virtuous qualities, she will provide robes, alms, cushions, medicines for curing illness, and all manner of supplies. She will practice the ten perfections {{page:{number:202,id:UT22084-064-002-1665,folio:F.213.b}}} and constantly uphold the five precepts. For all sentient beings who are poor or in servitude, she will give whatever to whomever in order to benefit them by any means, whoever and wherever they are. She will gradually tame many tens of millions of sentient beings, and once she has seen that those sentient beings’ virtuous roots have ripened, she will employ whichever of the infinite skillful means are available to her to proclaim the unparalleled sound of the sublime Dharma teachings of the peerless precious discourses spoken by all the tathāgatas, such as this Great Cloud discourse and others. She will copy these discourses{{note:{index:75,id:UT22084-064-002-915}}} and place the unparalleled volumes in all places that have been blessed by the buddhas.

“No, Bhagavān.”
{{milestone:{label:38.216,id:UT22084-064-002-920}}}The Bhagavān continued, “Great Cloud Essence, do not say that this goddess is not capable of exhibiting a great miraculous display. However, through her power to tame beings, she may choose not to. Why is that? After this goddess and others become monks and nuns who possess discipline, it is unfounded to think that here in Jambudvīpa there will be no sentient beings who do not pass into parinirvāṇa. Therefore, Great Cloud Essence, in order to engender faith in all future sentient beings with little merit, I give prophecies for the bodhisattvas in this discourse. At that time, Great Cloud Essence, when this goddess has left behind her female form, she will take birth in the buddhafield of Amitābha, the world system Blissful.

This world system of Endurance will become the world system Refined Purity, and the eon will be known as Purity and Truth. The world system Refined Purity will prosper and flourish, and it will be filled with bliss, happiness, good harvests, and many beings and people. At that time, when this world system has become prosperous and flourishing, there will arise a city here in Jambudvīpa called Fragrant Purity populated by ninety-eight trillion people. Within that incomparable city, there will be many incomparable walls, mansions, canopies, and moats. The river Fine Blackness, purified and with all its afflictions pacified, will at that time be called Excellent Purity, and on its banks, near and far, will lie incomparable groves with delightful gardens.

All men and women will join the bodhisattva saṅgha. There will be no mention or knowledge of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, but reports of the Great Vehicle discourses will spread far and wide. There will appear sentient beings who will triumph over Māra and all hostile forces. {{page:{number:204,id:UT22084-064-002-1667,folio:F.214.b}}} There will appear many who will attain the discoveries of purity and great acceptance. The ground will be made from all variety of precious jewels, and the Jambu river will be lined with golden flowers and all kinds of lotus blossoms. The Tathāgata’s lifespan will be unfathomable, and similarly the lifespan of all humans will be incalculable. The Tathāgata will abide in the city Fragrant Purity. I say that through that bhagavān’s special aspiration, in the future the entire great throng of sentient beings who simply hear of that tathāgata’s characteristics will, after they pass away from their current body, be born directly within the city Fragrant Purity in the world system of Refined Purity.
