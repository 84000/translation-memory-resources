The Application of Mindfulness of the Body
{{milestone:{label:5.1,id:UT22084-068-021-7942}}}At this point the Blessed One resided in the brahmin town of Nālati. {{page:{number:1925,id:UT22084-068-021-101954,folio:F.110.a,volume:V71}}} The Blessed One then addressed the monks: “Monks, I shall explain to you what is known as The Application of Mindfulness of the Body. I shall explain to you that which is virtuous in the beginning, middle, and end; that which exclusively consists of excellent meanings and excellent words; and a pure sort of conduct that is complete, pristine, and perfect. Such is the Dharma teaching known as The Application of Mindfulness of the Body. Pay full attention and listen well; I shall explain.” When the Blessed One had spoken these words, the monks listened accordingly.
{{milestone:{label:5.2,id:UT22084-068-021-7943}}}The Blessed One then spoke to them: “Monks, what is the Dharma teaching called The Application of Mindfulness of the Body? A monk who carefully considers the body and attends to it is not within the realm of the māras. He also relinquishes the afflictions. He sees the body correctly. He realizes wakefulness and is liberated within the transcendence of suffering. This is what I proclaim.
{{milestone:{label:5.3,id:UT22084-068-021-7944}}} “Monks who consider the body correctly will not be disturbed by improper mental acts. They become free from the afflictions. The body comprises all these things: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind that are of an inner nature, along with external form, taste, smell, texture, sound, and phenomena. If one carefully considers the body and attends to what is of an inner nature, one will eventually transcend suffering. In this regard, when a monk sees a form by means of the eye, he does not give rise to thoughts about it and he does not consider the form in a state of mind that involves lustful desire. The body contains hair, body hair, nails, bones, skin, blood, sinew, consumed food, eyebrows, phlegm, bile, {{page:{number:1926,id:UT22084-068-021-101955,folio:F.110.b,volume:V71}}} air, intestines, the colon, the anus, lungs, flesh, fat, semen, lymph, pus, the brain membrane, and the brain.
{{milestone:{label:5.4,id:UT22084-068-021-7945}}}“When one is mindful of the body one will not be ruined by forms, tastes, smells, textures, sounds, mental phenomena, or external phenomena. The eyes will from the very beginning see forms correctly. How do spiritual practitioners correctly see the physical eye that is a transformation of the four great elements? The physical eye that is of an internal nature has a slight degree of solidity and firmness. That is what is known as the earth element of the physical eye that is of an internal nature. The physical eye that is of an internal nature also contains a distinct element of water, which is wet and fluid. Thereby the eye retains moisture. That is what is known as the water element of the physical eye that is of an internal nature. The physical eye that is of an internal nature also contains a distinct element of fire, which is warmth and heat. Thereby the eye retains warmth. That is what is known as the fire element of the physical eye that is of an internal nature. The physical eye that is of an internal nature also contains a distinct element of wind and air, thus yielding movement. That is what is known as the wind element of the physical eye that is of an internal nature. In the same way that a monk thus understands the eye correctly, he also discerns the ear, nose, tongue, and body. And a monk who regards the body in this way will not be bound by any craving that involves lustful desire.
{{milestone:{label:5.5,id:UT22084-068-021-7946}}}“Moreover, the spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will think, {{page:{number:1927,id:UT22084-068-021-101956,folio:F.111.a,volume:V71}}} ‘Moment by moment, my body is born, ages, dies, undergoes transmigration, and is reborn. It is illusory, hollow, empty, insubstantial like foam, like bursting bubbles, and painful. It is a locus of suffering. It is a source of suffering. There is nothing there that is not painful, impermanent, and utterly changeable. There is nothing whatsoever in this body that is not subject to destruction.’
{{milestone:{label:5.6,id:UT22084-068-021-7947}}}“As he continues to discern the body correctly, the spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will then think, ‘What is the refuge; who is the savior? This body grows from karmic actions. Therefore, karmic actions are the refuge, they are the savior. When endowed with virtuous actions, one is born a god or a human, but when possessing unvirtuous actions, one takes birth as a hell being, starving spirit, or animal. This body has no substance and contains nothing that is clean. It has no essence and contains nothing that is permanent or stable.’ With this understanding, he will give up any craving that involves lustful desire.
{{milestone:{label:5.7,id:UT22084-068-021-7948}}}“The spiritual practitioner who understands the eye correctly will also ask himself, ‘Are the forms, appearances, and spaces that are seen by the eye of humans in Jambudvīpa the same as those seen by the eyes of humans elsewhere?’
“Considering this question well, he will regard the matter by means of knowledge derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye. In this way, he will recognize that for humans in Jambudvīpa, the perception of form takes place through the conditions of their eyes, forms, light, space, and mental activity. {{page:{number:1928,id:UT22084-068-021-101957,folio:F.111.b,volume:V71}}} Likewise, humans on the northern continent of Kuru may see forms while traveling through and remaining in the sky. Similar to the perception of fish that live in water, humans in Kuru in the north see forms in a way that is obscured according to their particular class.
{{milestone:{label:5.8,id:UT22084-068-021-7950}}}“Continuing to examine the bodies of humans in Kuru by means of his body in Jambudvīpa, the spiritual practitioner will then ask himself, ‘The sounds that my ears can hear may be unpleasant or clear, but I do not register sounds when there is an obstruction. I hear sounds when they are loud. But is it the same for humans in Kuru in the north?’ When he thus examines hearing correctly, he will notice that due to their unique situation the people on Kuru in the north hear sounds whether they are nearby, distant, weak, pleasant, or unpleasant. They hear in a way that resembles the way the sun shines on all things whether they are nearby, distant, common, inferior, clean, or unclean. Humans in Kuru in the north hear sounds in a manner similar to that.
{{milestone:{label:5.9,id:UT22084-068-021-7951}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will then ask himself, ‘Is the olfactory faculty of humans in Jambudvīpa similar to that of the humans in Kuru in the north?’ As he examines this question with knowledge derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice how their unique situation causes humans in Kuru to register only pleasant smells, and not foul ones. This resembles the way a swan that is fed milk mixed with water will drink only the milk, and not the water. Similarly, humans in Kuru in the north register only delightful fragrances and not any unpleasant smells.
{{milestone:{label:5.10,id:UT22084-068-021-7952}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will then ask himself whether the way taste is experienced by humans in Jambudvīpa is shared by the humans of Kuru. {{page:{number:1929,id:UT22084-068-021-101958,folio:F.112.a,volume:V71}}} With the help of knowledge derived from hearing or by means of the pure divine eye, he will then notice that while the bodies of humans in Jambudvīpa are sustained by foods that may be either superior, intermediate, or inferior, the situation of humans in Kuru in the north is not like that. Humans in Kuru do not have any sense of ownership and they constantly engage in virtuous actions. Without thinking themselves owners, they all experience one taste only. This is unlike the human context in Jambudvīpa.
{{milestone:{label:5.11,id:UT22084-068-021-7953}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also ask himself whether the form of the body of a human in Jambudvīpa is the same as that of a human in Kuru in the north. With the help of knowledge derived from hearing or by means of divine eye, he will then notice that, while the humans in Jambudvīpa have bodies of many different kinds, that is not the case with the humans in Kuru, who are all born based on similar actions. They therefore all have the same physical form and appearance, displaying a color that is like gold from the Jambu River. Their bodies are all large, and not rough but soft and attractive. In this way, they differ from the bodies of humans in Jambudvīpa. Humans in Jambudvīpa are not all born based on the same type of actions and they therefore also have different types of bodies, not just one and the same.
{{milestone:{label:5.12,id:UT22084-068-021-7954}}}“When he has considered those two human realms, the spiritual practitioner will next examine a third, namely Videha in the east. Through knowledge derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then see that while Videha in the east indeed is home to humans, just like Jambudvīpa and Kuru in the north, their perception of form is unlike that of humans in Jambudvīpa, because they do not see frightening sights, such as dogs, tigers, birds of prey, or rats. {{page:{number:1930,id:UT22084-068-021-101959,folio:F.112.b,volume:V71}}} Also, humans in Videha in the east see forms even in the dark. In this way, they notice the various subtle and crude forms that come into their visual field.
{{milestone:{label:5.13,id:UT22084-068-021-7955}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also ask himself whether humans in Videha in the east hear sounds in the same way as humans in Jambudvīpa. Through knowledge derived from hearing or by means of a divine eye, he will then notice that the humans in Videha in the east hear sounds in a way that is different from both humans in Jambudvīpa and Kuru in the north. Due to their unique situation, the aural consciousness of humans in Videha in the east registers only sounds within the distance of an arrowshot.
{{milestone:{label:5.14,id:UT22084-068-021-7956}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the bodies of the humans in these three realms will also ask himself whether the olfactory consciousness of humans in Videha in the east registers smells in the same way as humans in Jambudvīpa or Kuru in the north. Through knowledge derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then see that due to their unique situation, the olfactory consciousness of humans in Videha in the east registers scents only during the day.
{{milestone:{label:5.15,id:UT22084-068-021-7957}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also ask himself whether the gustatory consciousness of humans in Videha functions in the same way as that of humans in Jambudvīpa or Kuru in the north. With knowledge derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that when humans in Videha in the east consume a single meal of rice, it sustains their bodies for a period of three days. {{page:{number:1931,id:UT22084-068-021-101960,folio:F.113.a,volume:V71}}} Also, due to their unique situation, these humans live free from disease. Sickness sets in only during the final five days of their lives.
{{milestone:{label:5.16,id:UT22084-068-021-7958}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also ask himself whether the bodies of the humans in Videha in the east are just like those of humans in Jambudvīpa or Kuru in the north. With knowledge derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that the bodies of humans in Videha in the east cast large shadows over their surroundings, like a nyagrodha tree.
{{milestone:{label:5.17,id:UT22084-068-021-7959}}}“When the spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it has examined those three human realms, he will next examine a fourth, namely Godānīya. Wondering how the eye functions in Godānīya, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing or seeing with the divine eye and notice that the visual consciousness of humans in Godānīya functions even in the absence of open space, and thus they can even see through a mountain. Just as humans in Jambudvīpa can see appearances through a crystal, the people in Godānīya can see forms even through a mountain on account of their unique situation.
{{milestone:{label:5.18,id:UT22084-068-021-7960}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also ask himself whether the aural consciousness of humans in Godānīya functions in the same way as that of humans in Jambudvīpa, Kuru in the north, or Videha in the east. With knowledge derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that the humans in Godānīya hear with their eyes. Just as the snakes in Jambudvīpa hear with their eyes, so the humans in Godānīya likewise use their eyes for hearing. Just as they can see forms through a mountain, they can also hear sounds even if they occur behind a mountain, on account of their unique situation. {{page:{number:1932,id:UT22084-068-021-101961,folio:F.113.b,volume:V71}}}
{{milestone:{label:5.19,id:UT22084-068-021-7961}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also ask himself whether the olfactory consciousness of humans in Godānīya functions through a distinct faculty—the eyes and the rest— as is the case with the humans in Jambudvīpa, Kuru in the north, and Videha in the east. With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that when their eyes see something, such a flower, they also perceive its scent. Due their unique situation, their eyes also perceive the smell of the things they see.
{{milestone:{label:5.20,id:UT22084-068-021-7962}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also wonder about the functioning of the gustatory consciousness of humans in Godānīya. With knowledge derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that the humans of Godānīya eat sāmakā{{note:{index:571,id:UT22084-068-021-7963}}} for food and always drink cow’s yogurt, milk, and buttermilk. Moreover, the milk, yogurt, and buttermilk that the humans in Godānīya partake of is similar to the molasses wine, grape wine, sweet wine, and distilled wine that the humans in Jambudvīpa enjoy. And just as people in Jambudvīpa are satisfied by rice, those in Godānīya are satisfied by sāmakā.
{{milestone:{label:5.21,id:UT22084-068-021-7964}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also wonder about the bodies of the people in Godānīya. With knowledge derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that their bodies are as tall as palmyra palms, thus appearing in a form that accords with their particular karmic actions.
{{milestone:{label:5.22,id:UT22084-068-021-7965}}}“When in this way the spiritual practitioner examines the four human abodes—looking for identical or similar mind states, births, or supports—he finds nothing that is the same, neither through knowledge derived from hearing nor by seeing with the divine eye. {{page:{number:1933,id:UT22084-068-021-101962,folio:F.114.a,volume:V71}}} Carefully considering the body, he recognizes that in those four human abodes the mind states, births, and supports do not resemble one another.
{{milestone:{label:5.23,id:UT22084-068-021-7966}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also wonder whether in any place or region within those four human abodes there may be some people who are not experiencing their actions, who are not born according to their actions, and who do not live according to their actions. He will then fail to find any people who are not experiencing their actions, who are not born according to their actions, and who do not live according to their actions. Their actions may be virtuous or unvirtuous, yet everyone is experiencing their karmic actions. There are no aggregates that are not either pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
{{milestone:{label:5.24,id:UT22084-068-021-7967}}}“As the spiritual practitioner carefully considers the body in this way, he will also wonder about the bodies of the gods who experience the effects of positive actions, and about the ways that the gods possess and enjoy their heavenly sense pleasures. With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice the way the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings possess the five types of heavenly sense pleasures. Insatiably, their eyes enjoy divine forms, perceiving all the subtle and coarse forms within ten thousand leagues by seeing with the divine eye they are born with. If they engage in miraculous feats, they may also produce an eye capable of seeing forms even at a distance of many thousands of leagues. {{page:{number:1934,id:UT22084-068-021-101963,folio:F.114.b,volume:V71}}} The monk will see that among the gods, who possess the power of former positive actions, those who belong to the Heaven of the Four Great Kings live lives that are desirable, attractive, and delightful.
{{milestone:{label:5.25,id:UT22084-068-021-7968}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also ask himself how the ears of the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings hear sounds. With knowledge derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that all the sounds they hear are desirable, attractive, and delightful, and that the ears they are born with register sounds within three thousand leagues. When they engage in miraculous feats, they may even develop the ability to hear sounds within twenty thousand leagues, and all the sounds will still be desirable, attractive, and delightful.
{{milestone:{label:5.26,id:UT22084-068-021-7969}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also ask himself how the noses of the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings register smells. With knowledge derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that the noses of the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings sense smells within two hundred thousand leagues. By engaging in miraculous feats, they may even develop the ability to apprehend smells within one hundred thousand leagues.
{{milestone:{label:5.27,id:UT22084-068-021-7970}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also ask himself how the tongues of the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings register tastes. With knowledge derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that the tongues of the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings exclusively register superior tastes that are attractive, delightful, and pleasurable. These gods partake insatiably of tastes that are created by their own former positive actions.
{{milestone:{label:5.28,id:UT22084-068-021-7971}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also wonder about the relative subtlety, coarseness, and agility of the bodies of the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings. {{page:{number:1935,id:UT22084-068-021-101964,folio:F.115.a,volume:V71}}} With knowledge derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that even if five hundred gods reside on the same lotus flower, their extremely subtle bodies will not touch each other or feel uncomfortable. This is due to the splendor of the divine substance of the gods. For example, if five hundred butter lamps are lit within a house, the flames of the lamps will not obstruct or impede one another. Similarly, when the gods reside in their perfect palaces, they neither harm nor impede one another. The gods can also emanate coarse bodies that can measure many hundreds of leagues and be either beautiful or ugly, or frightening or heartwarming to look at.
{{milestone:{label:5.29,id:UT22084-068-021-7972}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also wonder about the speed of the gods’ movements. With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that the gods at times move swiftly. If they apply their miraculous powers, they may travel across many hundreds of thousands of leagues and return again all in the wink of an eye. They can also travel unimpededly wherever they wish. Whatever enjoyment they may wish to pursue, they will also achieve that in perfect measure. Once they have obtained something, that cannot be robbed or taken into the possession of others. Likewise, any object they may attain cannot be ruined or damaged by others. {{page:{number:1936,id:UT22084-068-021-101965,folio:F.115.b,volume:V71}}} So, their divine objects only increase throughout day and night. Their former positive deeds always provide them with a perfect abundance of sense pleasures. This is always the case. This is how the spiritual practitioner carefully considers the body.
{{milestone:{label:5.30,id:UT22084-068-021-7973}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also wonder about the bodies of the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three and the way those gods experience their objects. With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that compared to the pleasures of the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, the sounds, textures, tastes, forms, and fragrances of the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three are a thousand times more enjoyable. Why is that? Because compared to the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, those in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three have engaged in actions that are far more desirable, vast, delightful, beautiful, and superior. And why is that? The pleasures of the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings are incomparable because of the sublime character of the former positive actions of the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. This is how the spiritual practitioner carefully considers the body and attends to it in detail.
{{milestone:{label:5.31,id:UT22084-068-021-7974}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also wonder about the character of the bodies of beings in the hells. With insight derived from hearing, or by seeing with the divine eye, he will examine the inhabitants of the great hells of Reviving, Black Line, Crushing, Howling, Great Howling, Heat, Intense Heat, and Ultimate Torment, and will notice that they are born in those realms due to completed and accumulated actions of the three kinds—meaning actions of body, speech, and mind—that are unattractive, ugly, and unpleasant. {{page:{number:1937,id:UT22084-068-021-101966,folio:F.116.a,volume:V71}}} The reason for this is that, until they have been experienced, there is no way to be free from completed and accumulated negative actions.
{{milestone:{label:5.32,id:UT22084-068-021-7975}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will then wonder what actions make beings take birth in those hells. With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that by engaging in, becoming habituated to, and increasing acts of killing, one is born in the Reviving Hell. By engaging in, becoming habituated to, and increasing acts of killing and stealing, one is born in the Black Line Hell. By engaging in, becoming habituated to, and increasing acts of killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct, one is born in the Crushing Hell. By engaging in, becoming habituated to, and increasing acts of killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, and lying, one is born in the Howling Hell. By engaging in, becoming habituated to, and increasing acts of killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and causing people who observe vows to drink alcohol and wine, one is born in the Great Howling Hell. By engaging in, becoming habituated to, and increasing acts of killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, causing people who observe vows to drink alcohol and wine, and having wrong views, one is born in the Hell of Heat. By engaging in, becoming habituated to, and increasing acts of killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, offering alcohol and wine to people who observe vows, having wrong views, and defiling monks or nuns, one is born in the Hell of Intense Heat. Five actions that lead to hell produce birth in the hell of Ultimate Torment. {{page:{number:1938,id:UT22084-068-021-101967,folio:F.116.b,volume:V71}}} Those are patricide, matricide, killing a worthy one, causing a rift in the saṅgha, and maliciously drawing blood from a blessed buddha. Those acts bring birth in the hell of Ultimate Torment. Thinking about the ripening of actions experienced by the beings in hell, he will develop loving affection for sentient beings.
{{milestone:{label:5.33,id:UT22084-068-021-7976}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will then wonder about those beings who live as starving spirits. As the spiritual practitioner carefully considers the body, he will use knowledge derived from hearing or see by means of the divine eye. Doing so, he will perceive how, due to various forms of stinginess, the starving spirits{{note:{index:572,id:UT22084-068-021-7977}}} are born five hundred leagues below the earth where they suffer intensely from the miseries related to a lack of food, intense distress,{{note:{index:573,id:UT22084-068-021-7978}}} mutual predation, starvation, thirst, and scorching rains of fire. These beings have all taken birth according to their actions, experience the result of their actions, and live lives governed by their actions. In this way, he will observe how the starving spirits undergo such terrible sufferings.
{{milestone:{label:5.34,id:UT22084-068-021-7979}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will then also examine the animal realm. With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will see the multitudes of animals. In short, he will notice the animals of the three environments: those that live in water, such as fish; those that live on dry land, such as elephants, horses, cows, buffalo, deer, and pigs; and also the many animals that traverse the skies.
{{milestone:{label:5.35,id:UT22084-068-021-7980}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will use his eyesight, or insight derived from hearing, or seeing with the divine eye to examine the various modes by which animals take birth. {{page:{number:1939,id:UT22084-068-021-101968,folio:F.117.a,volume:V71}}} With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then see that animals are born in four ways: (1) pigs, cows, buffalo, elephants, horses, and the like are born from a womb; (2) snakes, geese, quail, domestic fowl, ravens, and so on are born from an egg; (3) lice, bedbugs, and the like are born from warmth and moisture; and (4) the long-faced nāgas, to give one example, are born miraculously. In this way, he will see the animals correctly.
{{milestone:{label:5.36,id:UT22084-068-021-7981}}}“Throughout the three contexts, all that is attractive and delightful will eventually be lost, disappear, disperse, and come to nothing. All that living beings consider agreeable, disagreeable, or neutral must eventually be abandoned. Everyone must die and take rebirth, again and again. There is no one in the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, animals, or anywhere else, to whom this does not apply. Monks, this cyclic existence is nothing to wish for. It is entirely joyless, unattractive, unpleasant, deceptive, and subject to destruction. All beings experience exceptional suffering. Monks, you should therefore free yourselves from desire for the realms of cyclic existence. They are meaningless, deceptive, and terrifying. They are impermanent, painful, dark, and trivial. As fast as you can, free yourselves from all this.”
{{milestone:{label:5.37,id:UT22084-068-021-7982}}}Following these instructions, the brahmins, householders, and monks in the town of Nālati carefully considered their bodies and attended to them, {{page:{number:1940,id:UT22084-068-021-101969,folio:F.117.b,volume:V71}}} and they correctly perceived the external body by means of the internal body. How then did the brahmins, householders, and monks in the town of Nālati carefully consider and attend to the internal body? They correctly saw how the internal body contained a mass of various unclean elements. Repeatedly examining and investigating the body from head to toe, they carefully considered the body.
{{milestone:{label:5.38,id:UT22084-068-021-7983}}}“When the spiritual practitioner begins such an investigation, he will apply insight derived from hearing or see with the divine eye. He will then make the following observations: ‘The skull that houses my brain, which has four parts, is made of four bone sections. It is home to various worms that live off the brain. Among these, the cranium dwellers feed on the brain, for they live within the cranium and eat off the brain. Such worms move and reside within the cranium. They are of that kind and subsist on such sustenance. The hair consumer worms live outside the cranium and consume the hair follicles on the head. Once they have consumed the greater part of a follicle, the respective hair will fall out. The worm called the ear occupier lives in the ears. It is born in the ears and lives off them, and when they become aggressive, they cause pain and disease in the ears. The mucus dweller lives in the nose. It is born there and lives off the nose. When it becomes aggressive, it consumes what is eaten, drunk, chewed, and tasted. From my nose, these worms may also transfer into the cranium and feed on the brain. When that happens, I suffer from a loss of appetite. The worm called fat dweller lives inside my head. {{page:{number:1941,id:UT22084-068-021-101970,folio:F.118.a,volume:V71}}} It is born there and lives off it, and when it becomes aggressive, it causes the head to become slanted. The worm called the joint dweller also lives in my body. It is born between the jaws and feeds on them. It sometimes crawls out of the ears and, when it becomes aggressive, it chews on them and pierces one’s face like a needle. The mucus eater worm lives in the cavities that absorb the taste of food and at the root of the tongue. It is born there and eats from its environments, and when it becomes aggressive, it causes my mouth to become dry. There are also worms that live by the roots of the teeth. When this dental-root eater becomes aggressive, it causes a toothache.’ In this way, the spiritual practitioner carefully considers and attends to the internal body.{{note:{index:574,id:UT22084-068-021-7984}}} He will think, ‘There are ten species of worms living in my head.’
{{milestone:{label:5.39,id:UT22084-068-021-7985}}}“Carefully considering his body that consists of cranium, flesh, and various inner elements, the spiritual practitioner will wonder how much bone and flesh is contained in one’s head. With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will notice that the cranium has four parts, the cheekbones have three, the chin bone has one, the bones of the dental roots have thirty-two, the palate bone has two, and the neck bones have fifteen.
{{milestone:{label:5.40,id:UT22084-068-021-7986}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers and attends to his own body will also examine the flesh that his head contains and the way it increases with food consumption. With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will understand that his cranium contains four pieces of flesh, while his cheeks have two, and the space in between the skull bones has one. The throat, nose, and tongue are individual pieces. The lips make up two, as do the earlobes. {{page:{number:1942,id:UT22084-068-021-101971,folio:F.118.b,volume:V71}}} Considering this, he will think, ‘I possess these lumps of flesh, which grow and expand in accordance with my consumption of food.’
{{milestone:{label:5.41,id:UT22084-068-021-7987}}}“There are also ten kinds of worms that occupy one’s throat. Those that live from filth in the mouth, those that cause spit production, and those that cause vomiting all cause fluids to move within the ten channels of the throat. There are also the worms that become intoxicated by sweetness, those utterly intoxicated, those that crave for the six tastes, those that cry out, those that are opposed to taste, those that enjoy sleeping, and the bulky ones.
{{milestone:{label:5.42,id:UT22084-068-021-7988}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also wonder, ‘How and where in my body do the worms cause disease or preserve health?’ With knowledge derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will notice that the spit-producing worms live in the upper part of the throat. The moment when the molar teeth grind food so that it descends into the stomach, the food is covered in nauseating impurities that flow from the brain membrane. However, the worms consume those impurities that are covered with mucus. These worms can grow to a very large size, thus causing cough due to phlegm. The worms are born in the throat due to foods that are fatty, sweet, very sweet, not very sour, and very cold.
{{milestone:{label:5.43,id:UT22084-068-021-7989}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also wonder, ‘Does the spit-producing worm promote well-being or give rise to poor health?’ With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice, {{page:{number:1943,id:UT22084-068-021-101972,folio:F.119.a,volume:V71}}} ‘The spit-producing worms live in my throat. If they remain in their natural condition, the nauseating impurities on my food mentioned previously will not occur. I will feel good as the food descends into the ten streams of vital fluids. For example, if phlegm increases, I will not remain healthy, but these worms will suck up any such excess phlegmatic fluid.’
{{milestone:{label:5.44,id:UT22084-068-021-7990}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will, with insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, also ask himself, ‘How do the worms that cause vomiting affect my health and how does food remain in my body?’ When the worms that cause vomiting enter the ten streams of vital fluids, they reach the center of the throat. At that point, they may cause the flow to momentarily shift upward and emerge. Five factors cause vomiting of what was consumed: wind, bile, phlegm, contraction, and pungency. When the worms remain in their natural location, the worms will, as mentioned before, descend to the lower part of the stomach, where they function to digest and liquefy my food.’
{{milestone:{label:5.45,id:UT22084-068-021-7991}}}“Wondering how the vomit-inducing worms produce vomiting through the circumstance of wind, the spiritual practitioner will employ insight derived from hearing or see with the divine eye. He will then understand, ‘This occurs through lightness, cooling, roughness, momentary constipation, or lack of sleep. When the winds rise from the cavities of my throat, my vomit-inducing worms will transfer from their abode. That is how vomiting occurs due to wind.’
{{milestone:{label:5.46,id:UT22084-068-021-7992}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will ask himself, ‘How do my vomit-inducing worms stimulate vomiting due to bile?’ {{page:{number:1944,id:UT22084-068-021-101973,folio:F.119.b,volume:V71}}} With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then understand, ‘When a lot of spicy, warm, salty, or pungent food is consumed, such food harms the worms that cause vomiting. As a result, they wriggle upward, which causes me to vomit due to bile.’
{{milestone:{label:5.47,id:UT22084-068-021-7993}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also ask himself, ‘How does vomiting occur due to phlegm?’ With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then understand, ‘Imbalances of phlegm occur when one indulges in sweet, cold, heavy, fatty, or feeble foods, and if one sleeps continually during the day and night. Such imbalances cause a proliferation of the vomit-inducing worms, thus causing illnesses in my throat as well as vomiting. In this way, vomiting may also occur due to phlegm.’
{{milestone:{label:5.48,id:UT22084-068-021-7994}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also ask himself, ‘How do my vomit-inducing worms cause vomiting due to contraction?’ With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then see that by indulging in food that is cool, bitter, spicy, sour, salty, sugary, cold, sweet, or oily, one’s vomit-inducing worms will want to expel it from the throat. There will then be vomiting due to the three flaws.
{{milestone:{label:5.49,id:UT22084-068-021-7995}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will also ask himself, ‘How do my vomit-inducing worms stimulate vomiting due to flies?’ With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then see how the excrement of flies may stir the vomit-inducing worms within the throat. That will in turn trigger vomiting.

They are extremely subtle, have no limbs, and wriggle along. If I eat tasty food, the worms intoxicated by sweetness will flourish through that food, but if I eat unpleasant food, they will degenerate. They feed in a way that is comparable to the way bees visit flowers to drink from the subtle nectars. Similarly, the worms that are intoxicated by sweetness become pleased and satisfied by the extremely subtle forms of sustenance found in my food. Moreover, the foods that I relish are precisely those that the worms intoxicated by sweetness relish, and the foods that increase my well-being are exclusively those that increase the well-being of the worms intoxicated by sweetness. If I do not eat, my worms intoxicated by sweetness will become sick.’ In this way he examines this unpleasant species of worm that is intoxicated by sweetness.
{{milestone:{label:5.51,id:UT22084-068-021-7997}}}“Next, wondering whether the utterly intoxicated worm causes health or imbalance, the spiritual practitioner will apply insight derived from hearing or see with the divine eye. He will then notice that the utterly intoxicated worms live at the roots of the eye sockets. If they move to the joints of the neck bone, this will make him feel angry or unhappy. They cause the flesh of the throat to swell and they may invade the throat like ants and take possession of it. When they remain in their own place, such ailments will not occur.
{{milestone:{label:5.52,id:UT22084-068-021-7998}}}“When in this way he has examined the utterly intoxicated worm, he will next consider the worm that craves the six tastes. The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it will then ask himself whether those worms that give rise to craving in people cause health or imbalance. {{page:{number:1946,id:UT22084-068-021-101975,folio:F.120.b,volume:V71}}} With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice, ‘Whenever the worm that is attached to and craves for the six tastes craves a certain taste, I too will become fond of that. Likewise, whichever tastes those worms do not like I will not cling to either. If I contract a fever, the worms will also soon become afflicted by fever. Such ailments will make me lose my appetite.’
{{milestone:{label:5.53,id:UT22084-068-021-7999}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers and attends to the internal body will then examine the wheezing worm that lives below the sockets of his eyes. With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will realize, ‘When the wheezing worms become aggressive, they will slither into my head. They will then contaminate my eye sockets and cause my neck to become slanted. They will gnaw on my trachea and blow{{note:{index:575,id:UT22084-068-021-8000}}} air inside my throat. This will give rise to a suffering that feels like I am dying. The wheezing worm and the other worms that live in the throat are always working against each other. When they fight in this way, these ailments occur. The wheezing worms are covered with spit and their mouths and legs are short.’
{{milestone:{label:5.54,id:UT22084-068-021-8001}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers and attends to the internal body will then use insight derived from hearing or seeing with the divine eye. Doing so, he will notice, ‘The worm opposed to taste lives at the base of my throat and in the sockets of my eyes. {{page:{number:1947,id:UT22084-068-021-101976,folio:F.121.a,volume:V71}}} Does this worm cause health or infirmity? The worm opposed to taste likes only a single taste and is opposed to all others. If it likes a sweet taste, it is opposed to all other tastes. If it likes a sour taste, it is opposed to all other tastes. If it likes a spicy taste, it is opposed to all other tastes. If it likes a salty taste, it is opposed to all other tastes. If it likes a bitter taste, it is opposed to all other tastes. Whichever taste such an angry worm dislikes, I will also dislike. There is yet another worm called taste movement that appears at the tip of my tongue. Once taste is perceived there, this worm causes the tip of my tongue to become dry. When it becomes aggressive, it will feed off my tongue and cause discomfort. When the tongue is retracted into the throat, the worm is not aggressive. When the worm is not aggressive, none of these ailments will occur.’
{{milestone:{label:5.55,id:UT22084-068-021-8002}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers and attends to the internal body will use insight derived from hearing or seeing with the divine eye. Doing so, he will notice, ‘My worms that enjoy sleeping are subtle—no larger than a sun ray particle. They move through areas in which no other worms are found. Like the wind, they move through the vital arteries, gristle, flesh, brain membrane, cheekbones, dental roots, neck, throat, ears, eyes, nose, hair, and body hair. {{page:{number:1948,id:UT22084-068-021-101977,folio:F.121.b,volume:V71}}} During the day, these worms that enjoy sleeping are either torpid or asleep. At night, they move in the arteries of the heart. The heart retains a lotus shape during the day, but during the night it contracts due the absence of sunlight. At that time, the worms are dormant within the heart, since the lotus shape of the heart contracts at that time. That will also make me dispassionate. If the worms that enjoy sleeping become inactive, the faculties will also grow tired from their engagements with objects and go dormant. Thereby, all those creatures will fall asleep. Indeed, even during day, the faculties will thereby become disengaged.’ In this way, the spiritual practitioner correctly understands the worms that enjoy sleeping.
{{milestone:{label:5.56,id:UT22084-068-021-8003}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers and attends to the internal body will use insight derived from hearing or seeing with the divine eye. Doing so, he will notice, ‘The bulky worms that live in my body move through the blood in my head and throat, as well as in the fat. Whenever they become emaciated, they will drink from my blood, which makes me feel cold. They will also nibble all around my mouth, hair, joints, or elsewhere. When they do not move around, they reside in the tendons, and at such times, none of those ailments will occur.’
{{milestone:{label:5.57,id:UT22084-068-021-8004}}}“This is how those brahmins and householders from the town of Nālati, or a monk who is a spiritual practitioner, correctly observe and understand the types of worms that live in the body, such as those that live in the throat, the tongue, the neck bones, the hair follicles, the phlegm, the bones, {{page:{number:1949,id:UT22084-068-021-101978,folio:F.122.a,volume:V71}}} the blood, and the tendons. Thereby, one becomes free from desire for the tastes encountered by the tongue. One will overcome all craving that is directed toward such tastes. Ānanda, beings who are bound by the ties of craving are attached to an ocean of tastes, but in this way, one is freed from desire for them all. Free from desire, one will not be bound by craving for food. One will not pay visits and offer service at the homes of donors and benefactors. One will not accumulate wealth and household articles. One will be content with simple lentil broth. One will not become angry at others for reasons of wealth and service. One will not become fond of attending great gatherings. One will not become excited because of temples and gardens. One will not become excited based on physical attraction. One will not become excited based on physical appearances. One will not become excited because of clothes. One will not become excited with regard to one’s alms bowl. One will not become excited because of one’s Dharma robes. One will not become excited due to having a following of mendicants. One will not become excited by visiting towns. One will not become excited by encountering friends. One will live alone, not yearn for pleasures, stay clear of pollutants, overcome negativity, and abide within the realm of mendicants. One will abide within the transcendence of suffering. On the other hand, those who are carried away by the ocean of tastes, those who crave the ocean of tastes, will find themselves before the māras. They are far from the transcendence of suffering. {{page:{number:1950,id:UT22084-068-021-101979,folio:F.122.b,volume:V71}}} Therefore, by contemplating the worms that live in the body, spiritual practitioners become free from desire for tastes. Free from desire, they are not led astray by food.

They also cause warts. When the driller worm becomes aggressive, it enters the bloodstream and causes disturbances throughout the body. The jantumandarava worm gives the bloodstream a foul smell. Being a blood worm, the audumbara worm is provoked and agitated by blood, thus causing pustules, pimples, and ulcers in the mouth and nose. {{page:{number:1954,id:UT22084-068-021-101983,folio:F.124.b,volume:V71}}} When the grasper worm becomes aggressive within the blood stream, it causes disease of the liver, blood, and bile.

From there, it consumes the hair and, as it enters the nose, it causes a profusion of mucus. It then enters the fat, joints, jaws, and forehead, consuming the roots of the teeth. There are ten further species of worms that cause vomiting and live in the throat and neck. They consume nasal mucus, move in the saliva, and cause severe vomiting. Within the ten channels of vital fluids live the worms intoxicated by sweetness, the utterly intoxicated, those that crave the six tastes, those that cry out, those opposed to taste, those that enjoy sleeping, and the bulky.

Wondering what function this wind may have when either disturbed or in balance, he will apply insight derived from hearing or see with the divine eye, and observe, ‘Any disturbance of the descending wind occurs in five ways and along five paths. This wind resides in five places. What are the functions it performs as it resides in those five places? It functions to create the movements of inhalation and exhalation of the breath. This is what in the world is referred to as the life force. Situated in the head and chest, it moves within them and disperses strength to the entire body. If it becomes excessive, it destroys the functions of the body. It causes mucus and cough to move upward through the passage of food from below. Thereby inhalations and exhalations take place in the chest and the heart, which gives rise to intense pleasure. When the wind passes upward, the pleasure will be lost. It moves upward within the cavities of the throat, emerging in the head where it moves to the base of the tongue. When it dwells in the tongue it connects with the cooperating condition of an immediately preceding instant of mind and thus various syllables emerge that facilitate understanding. A third function of this wind is to continuously spread warmth within the body. This, however, can also cause problems. A fourth function of this wind is to permeate and maintain the body. It supports the closing and opening of the eyes and it also resides in the waist, feet, thighs, penis, and colon. {{page:{number:2002,id:UT22084-068-021-102031,folio:F.148.b,volume:V71}}} It expands the stomach but causes a deficiency in women. When present in the lowest joint of the backbone it unites semen and blood in females. Then, by stirring forcefully in their legs, it mingles semen and blood. It also causes liquids to move. When food is digested, the fire quality, which is described as a third aspect, causes separation. This wind also takes on various long, short, round, and square forms, which correlate to the body’s manifestations, dimensions, and shapes. It is also connected to consciousness in various ways. For example, when a woman mixes thick milk and water in a jar and churns the liquid, it first causes a froth to form, which subsequently solidifies and turns into butter. This resembles the way that this wind combines with all the afflictions within the body. As for the fifth function, when that which is eaten, drunk, consumed, and ingested comes into contact with the tongue and its cavities, this wind ensures that the flavors, colors, and smells of the food are distributed throughout the body, from the hair at one end to the nails at the other. When the food-descending wind is disturbed, it acts in five ways that eliminate well-being and it blocks the breath in the upper body. This causes great disturbances throughout the body, and may even lead to loss of the body, which is the third kind of disturbance. {{page:{number:2003,id:UT22084-068-021-102032,folio:F.149.a,volume:V71}}} All faculties and cognitions become disturbed and even the body may be lost. When the body is lost, three factors are destroyed: life force, warmth, and consciousness. A verse speaks of this:
{{milestone:{label:5.153,id:UT22084-068-021-8129}}}“ ‘Life force, warmth, and then consciousness—
When the body loses these three,
It falls flat,

This will cause great discomfort throughout the body, and the body may be even be lost as a result. There is also a third effect when this wind is disturbed. All faculties and cognitions will become distracted to the extent that one may fall unconscious and even abandon the body. There is also a fourth effect when this wind is disturbed. Occasionally, one may draw a breath so forceful or weak that the body is relinquished. Alternatively, without dying, one may continue breathing in an unconscious state.’ In this way, with knowledge of the descending wind, he develops a correct understanding of the body.

{{milestone:{label:5.228,id:UT22084-068-021-8217}}}In this way the Brahmins, householders, and mendicants in the town of Nālati carefully considered the internal body.
{{milestone:{label:5.229,id:UT22084-068-021-8218}}}“How do spiritual practitioners engage in practice? Monks, spiritual practitioners consider the internal body by means of external phenomena. When they see external phenomena, they carefully consider the internal body. They first examine seeds, noticing that they give rise to sprouts. From sprouts grow stems, {{page:{number:2049,id:UT22084-068-021-102078,folio:F.172.a,volume:V71}}} from stems come petals, from petals grow flowers, and from the flowers come fruits. In the same way, spiritual practitioners understand their own internal nature. They first notice how the seed-like consciousness accompanied by karmic action and afflictions descends into the semen. From the semen comes the oval shape, from the oval shape emerges the oblong, from the oblong comes the lumpy, and from the lumpy develops the fivefold protrusion of the two legs, two arms, and the head. Based on those five protrusions, the faculties become fully developed. Thus, successive stages lead to aging and death.
{{milestone:{label:5.230,id:UT22084-068-021-8219}}}“A spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the external body and attends to it will also notice that while initially seeds are green, they later become gray and old, and in the end they disappear completely. Likewise, this body is initially that of an infant, but the infant grows up, the adult ages, and after aging, the body will also disappear entirely.
{{milestone:{label:5.231,id:UT22084-068-021-8220}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the external body and attends to it will further wonder, ‘How do external seeds appear and how do trees and forests grow from the ground?’ With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that all these phenomena mutually serve as each other’s causes and conditions. All external and internal conditioned factors arise by their mutual power. This goes for everything except three factors: {{page:{number:2050,id:UT22084-068-021-102079,folio:F.172.b,volume:V71}}} analytical cessation, non-analytical cessation, and space. How do phenomena appear based on their mutual power? Ignorance serves as the condition for formation, formation is the condition for consciousness, consciousness is the condition for name-and-form, name-and-form are the conditions for the six sense sources, the six sense sources are the conditions for contact, contact is the condition for sensation, sensation is the condition for craving, craving is the condition for grasping, grasping is the condition for becoming, becoming is the condition for birth, and birth is the condition for aging and death, agony, lamentation, suffering, unhappiness, and exhaustion. Thus emerges this great heap of nothing but suffering.
{{milestone:{label:5.232,id:UT22084-068-021-8221}}}“Monks, when ignorance ceases, formation ceases; when formation ceases, consciousness ceases; when consciousness ceases, name-and-form cease; when name-and-form cease, the six sense sources cease; when the six sense sources cease, contact ceases; when contact ceases, sensation ceases; when sensation ceases, craving ceases; when craving ceases, grasping ceases; when grasping ceases, becoming ceases; when becoming ceases, birth ceases; and when birth ceases, aging and death, agony, lamentation, suffering, unhappiness, and all manner of misery come to an end. Thus, this great heap that is nothing but suffering ceases. In this way, all these phenomena serve as each other’s conditions. Whether external or internal and personal, phenomena give rise to one another. {{page:{number:2051,id:UT22084-068-021-102080,folio:F.173.a,volume:V71}}}. The spiritual practitioner thinks, ‘The external phenomena are just like the internal phenomena, and the internal phenomena are just like the external phenomena.’ In this way, he carefully considers the internal body, just as he carefully considers the external body in the correct way. This is how spiritual practitioners cognize external and internal phenomena. At first, they for a while consider how phenomena develop in Jambudvīpa. Next, they discern the single teaching that clarifies the state of their own internal phenomena. Thereby they carefully identify individual phenomena and understand their particular qualities, such as their suitability and other properties.{{note:{index:618,id:UT22084-068-021-8222}}} They notice how the entire mass of living creatures comes about due to outer and inner conditions, and they see how external factors influence their own internal mind and mental states.
{{milestone:{label:5.233,id:UT22084-068-021-8223}}}“Here, one may wonder, ‘Do external phenomena make internal phenomena flourish such that they become extremely clear, or do internal phenomena make external phenomena flourish such that they become extremely clear?’ In that regard, external phenomena may make internal phenomena flourish because when spiritual practitioners possess a dwelling, bedding, and medical supplies, they will take joy in virtuous qualities. On the other hand, when they lack a dwelling, medical supplies, and daily requisites they will not take any joy in virtuous qualities. In this way, phenomena give rise to one another, depend on one another, produce one another, {{page:{number:2052,id:UT22084-068-021-102081,folio:F.173.b,volume:V71}}} and are effects of one another. Apart from this, there is no other agent or anything that is permanent, stable, enduring, or unchanging. Nor is anything produced by any causally productive “absence of causes.” Even with the greatest effort no such thing can be seen.
{{milestone:{label:5.234,id:UT22084-068-021-8224}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it through the external body will also ask himself, ‘How do all beings who are born in the three realms experience a flourishing of their own inner properties due to a single external activity?’ With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice, ‘The single factor that pertains to all beings born through formation is sustenance. This is of four types: material food, attention, contact, and joy. In the realm of desire, these types of sustenance serve as seeds, and thus these external forms of sustenance enhance one’s own internal facility in concentration.’
{{milestone:{label:5.235,id:UT22084-068-021-8225}}}“Upon initially examining external phenomena, the spiritual practitioner will wonder, ‘How are internal phenomena maintained by external phenomena?’ With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that during the age of excellence those causes, conditions, or bases that constitute all beings’ sustenance are endowed with eight aspects. What are the eight? Pleasant sounds, textures, tastes, forms, and smells, as well as pleasant vital fluids, and agreeable colors and shapes. Whenever there is an increase of external phenomena in the form of dwellings, medical supplies, and other requisites, the body will flourish. At that time, one will delight in one’s own internal virtuous qualities. {{page:{number:2053,id:UT22084-068-021-102082,folio:F.174.a,volume:V71}}} In this way the spiritual practitioner carefully considers the external body and attends to it.
{{milestone:{label:5.236,id:UT22084-068-021-8226}}}“Whenever bees, meat flies, small ants, and the like do not cause trouble to the body, one will be inclined toward one’s own internal phenomena. Whenever cold, heat, rain, and the like do not cause discomfort to the body, one will develop fondness for one’s own internal phenomena. Whenever one hears desirable, attractive, and delightful sounds, one will take joy in one’s own internal phenomena. Whenever one smells desirable, attractive, and delightful scents, one will take joy in one’s own internal phenomena. Whenever cold, heat, rain and the like do not cause harm to the body, one will take joy in one’s own internal phenomena. Whenever the five faculties flourish due to the five external sense sources, the five inner sense sources will flourish. In this way, carefully considering the body and attending to it through the external body, sons of noble family who truly adhere to the Great Vehicle, or noble hearers, develop accurate knowledge of the body.
{{milestone:{label:5.237,id:UT22084-068-021-8227}}}“Moreover, when the spiritual practitioner carefully considers the external body and attends to it, he will also delight in his own six collections of consciousness. With the help of knowledge derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that if external phenomena do not cause trouble, his own internal phenomena will be in balance and thus he will take joy in phenomena. What are the six collections of consciousness? They are the eye consciousness, {{page:{number:2054,id:UT22084-068-021-102083,folio:F.174.b,volume:V71}}} the ear consciousness, the nose consciousness, the tongue consciousness, the body consciousness, and the mind consciousness. One’s own internal phenomena and external entities mutually depend on and accompany each other. For example, when a bird flies through the sky, its shadow follows it wherever it goes. Likewise, one’s own internal entities always depend on external ones. If the body flourishes, the mind will not deteriorate. All these things stand in mutual dependency and arise due to conditions. In this way, the spiritual practitioner realizes that all phenomena without exception are impermanent, unstable, fleeting, and subject to change.
{{milestone:{label:5.238,id:UT22084-068-021-8228}}}“Moreover, the spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it through the external body will also notice how the lifespans of humans in Jambudvīpa shorten and increase. With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then notice that during the age of perfection all humans have descended from the god realm of Luminosity and therefore consume medicinal plants for their food. Just as ambrosia is the food of the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, so humans during the age of perfection have virtuous minds and are nourished by medicinal plants that have excellent color, scent, form, and texture. Because these flawless humans are sustained by such food, they achieve a lifespan of eighty-four thousand years. {{page:{number:2055,id:UT22084-068-021-102084,folio:F.175.a,volume:V71}}} There are three classes of disease—associated with hunger, thirst, and desire—but these humans are excellently nourished and do not develop diseases.

Due to flaws in their food, humans become afflicted with diseases associated with wind, bile, and phlegm. The spiritual practitioner will notice the entire mass of conditioned factors that manifest when external sustenance causes the inner sense sources to flourish. In this way, he correctly considers the influence of external factors on the body.

The humans of that time suffer continuously from disease {{page:{number:2056,id:UT22084-068-021-102085,folio:F.175.b,volume:V71}}} and they age prematurely.

After all those are destroyed, the skin, bones, and marrow of the humans in Jambudvīpa will begin to get slightly colder. Because of the lack of good food, everyone will come to resemble mere skeletons.

From this mountain flows the Narmadā River, which is half a league wide and runs a course of two hundred leagues. Highly poisonous nāgas live there, and the river is full of infant-eating crocodiles, as well as other predatory reptiles. A second river, the Wavy, splits off from the Narmadā. There is also a third river, Powerful, along the banks of which grow delightful trees. Another river, Black Swirling, is three leagues deep and runs a course of three hundred leagues until it flows into the sea. The Great Rodhā River is full of highly poisonous nāgas.

Thus, there are seventy primary rivers that flow through White Cloud, the fourth forest on Saṅkāśa Mountain; the intermediate and minor rivers have not been mentioned here. In this way, examining the qualities of this forest of cool streams with its immensely gorgeous trees, flowers, and birds, the practitioner develops a correct understanding of the exterior.

Their trees bear leaves, flowers, and fruits; through the forests flow rivers; there are rocks, flatlands, and meadows, mountain caves, caverns, and waterfalls. Yet, nowhere is there a spot, even the size of a mere pinhead, where sentient beings must not undergo hundreds and thousands of births, deaths, and rebirths. Nowhere is there a spot where they must not separate from, part with, lose, or see transformed all that they hold dear. There is no place where they can avoid their enemy—the body—for hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands of lives. There is not even a gap the size of a pinhead where sentient beings must not die and be reborn.’ In this way, examining the mountain known as Saṅkāśa, he develops a correct understanding of the body.

Three hundred of the peaks on Equal Peaks are of gold and unrivaled. Their bright light shines like a second sun. Five hundred additional peaks are of silver and endowed with similar qualities. The special qualities of this mountain permeate the environment, and thus the people of Kuru in the north who live by this mountain are all luminous like the full moon. Known as fearless people, these humans play and revel in the pleasures of the five senses together with the gods of the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, joyously celebrating throughout the four months of summer. What, then, is the difference between these fearless people and the gods of the Heaven of the Four Great Kings? The gods have no flesh, bone, or lymph, but these fearless people still do. This makes them different from the gods. These fearless people also have no sense of ‘mine,’ no conceit, and are certain to proceed upward. That is not the case with the gods. Those are the differences between the fearless people and the gods of the Heaven of the Four Great Kings.

Infatuated birds of the kinds previously mentioned also play there. The trees are adorned with golden leaves and there are many hundreds of pools filled with lotuses of blue beryl. The pools are teeming with thousands of geese and ducks, and cakravākas roam there. Among the many different flocks of wild animals that inhabit this area, some are golden while others bear the colors of coral, musāragalva, rājapaṭṭi, and so forth. Vines draped with nets of pearl also decorate the landscape, and the calls of cuckoos, peacocks, and geese fill the atmosphere. There are hundreds of thousands of cascades, as well as abundant rivers and groves. In this way, the environment is endowed with infinite qualities. Noticing this second mountain, Equal Peaks, on Kuru in the north, the spiritual practitioner develops accurate knowledge of the body.

Everyone must separate from all that is agreeable and delightful. All must leave, and everything will be lost and robbed. Hence, the spiritual practitioner does not see any such place on Equal Peaks. There is nothing anywhere that endures, is stable, is delightful, involves a self, and is not empty. There is no place where beings do not get born, age, and die. Everything disappears, and is lost, separated from, and robbed. {{page:{number:2107,id:UT22084-068-021-102136,folio:F.201.a,volume:V71}}} Because of that, all of cyclic existence is impermanent.

All the pleasures that are found on the mountains of Saṅkāśa and Equal Peaks are also present on Tamer of Deer Enemies without any difference. Still, the latter mountain is unique with respect to its perfect cascades and streams, rivers of wine, and trees of garments. Trees of gold and silver bear garlands of flowers throughout the six seasons, blooming with rich delights. The trees possess a natural brilliance and shine like the sun, thus mutually illumining each other and the entire mountain of Tamer of Deer Enemies. The following four forests are found there: Endowed with Gold, Lofty Heaps of Silver, Egg-Born Infatuation, and Yielding to Pressure and Bouncing Back. The forest called Endowed with Gold covers one hundred leagues and bees buzz about everywhere among its golden trees. {{page:{number:2108,id:UT22084-068-021-102137,folio:F.201.b,volume:V71}}} The forest of Lofty Heaps of Silver covers three hundred leagues. Full of trees of silver, it shines like a hundred thousand moons. This forest is also full of lions. It always has a white radiance and abounds with ever-joyous birds of the species mentioned earlier. The third forest on Tamer of Deer Enemies is known as Egg-Born Infatuation. In that forest live birds in careless happiness. The people who live there are called the ever-subdued. They always enjoy themselves in the forest of Egg-Born Infatuation and because their splendor allows them to partake of whatever they please, they resemble gods. The fourth forest on Tamer of Deer Enemies is Yielding to Pressure and Bouncing Back. Its trees of gold, radiant gold, and coral are always full of birds and the forest covers five leagues. The people who inhabit this area are called the highly crazed. The ground in this forest is white and smooth like Kāśī silk or cotton wool, and when the highly crazed people play in the forest of Yielding to Pressure and Bouncing Back, the earth does just that.

This mountain is made of bright white silver, outshining even the moon with its radiance. As an example, when the moon rises in Jambudvīpa, the lights of the planets, stars, and the minor celestial bodies all disappear. Likewise, the mountain known as Encircled by White Clouds outshines the light of the moon. The people who live by Encircled by White Clouds are known as the flower garland wearers. From the time they are born on Encircled by White Clouds, they spend their lives in a constant pursuit of fun, adorning themselves with flower anthers, singing happy songs, and incessantly enjoying themselves in the lotus groves.

This is how the gods play their drums in the Drumbeats forest. {{page:{number:2110,id:UT22084-068-021-102139,folio:F.202.b,volume:V71}}} No singers in Jambudvīpa can compare to even a sixteenth of their beauty. With respect to wild animals, birds, lotuses, trees, thickets, parks, bathing ponds, pools, the ground of gold and silver, and waterfalls, the Drumbeats forest possesses all the qualities that were mentioned before. There, accompanied by melodious drumbeats, the garland-wearer people remain attached to the enjoyment of pleasures, enjoying the delightful sounds, tastes, sights, and scents in a way that resembles the celebrations of the vessel-bearer gods in their heavenly parks.

No such happiness—reliable, permanent, stable, enduring, or a method for attaining the transcendence of suffering—is to be seen at all, just as there is no darkness to be seen in the sun. All mundane pleasures are sweet when experienced, but nasty when they ripen. They are all afflictive and offer no deliverance from craving. Their fruits are terrible; they are poisonous like the kimbaka fruit, just like weapons and fire, and only enjoyed for a while. Like a dancer’s makeup, they are delightful for just a moment. They pass so rapidly, like flashes of lightning. Their force is like a waterfall, they bring harm, and they are deceptive, like a city of gandharvas. They destroy everyone. They are just like fruit that is bound to fall off. Their ripening resembles a poisonous meal and is extremely sharp, like a razor’s edge. They deceive in hundreds of thousands of ways and are like trees on the banks of a river, all bound to fall. As the spiritual practitioner regards all pleasures in this way, he develops a deep sadness. Thus, he sees things correctly, sees by means of correct mental engagement, and possesses purified perception. {{page:{number:2113,id:UT22084-068-021-102142,folio:F.204.a,volume:V71}}}

Measuring one thousand leagues, this mountain presents a most lovely environment filled with light. The types of trees to be found there have beryl leaves, blazing gold trunks, coral leaves, silver trunks, and golden leaves. These trees shine like one hundred and eight butter lamps. There are also many hills, as well as other species of trees, types of lotuses, parks, wild animals, and mountain summits. All of these are as described before. The area that is covered by the various parts of Lofty Summit measures two hundred leagues. One of its summits is frequented by celebrating garland-bearer gods and triple-lute-bearer gods, who otherwise live on Sumeru. Because Lofty Summit is so delightful, triple-lute-bearer gods abandon the terraces of Sumeru to come and enjoy themselves on that mountain.

There are five such subsidiary peaks, covering an area of two hundred leagues. One peak is a mass of precious substances and all sorts of precious substances emerge from it, such as vidruma, coral, beryl, musāragalva, crystal, ruby, sukumārikā, blue sapphire, great blue sapphire, and unwoven fabrics. A second peak is made of silver and upon it grow silver trees, as well as the exquisite sandal tree known as gośīrṣaka. {{page:{number:2114,id:UT22084-068-021-102143,folio:F.204.b,volume:V71}}} During the wars between the gods and asuras, whenever a god is wounded and falls on the battlefield, those trees can heal the body of the fallen god. Gośīrṣaka is in fact both a name for the mountain and for the trees that grow there. A third peak is known as Celebrating Goddesses. Goddesses frolic there, enjoying the forests and parks; the anthers of gold, silver, and beryl; and the soft ground. In this way, they enjoy themselves, laugh, revel, and play. Corrupted by their craving for such pleasures, ordinary childish beings turn away from the sacred Dharma and thus, out of their incessant attachment to pleasure, keep assembling on that peak. On the fourth peak, gods from the Heaven of the Four Great Kings celebrate in groves and parks full of grapes. There are ever-inebriated animals, birds, guhyaka gods, vidyādharas, and humans. Also, rivers of grape wine flow there. Some taste like honey, others taste aromatic, and still others have a blended taste. Pure gold can be found along the banks of the rivers on that peak. Gold emerges in shapes that look like cows, buffalo, pigs, elephants, jackals, camels, cattle, wolves, nāgas, wildcats, lions, bears, foxes, and birds. There are also jewels of many different colors to be seen. The emergence of such pure gold on that peak is due to the nāgas that live there. On the fifth peak grow lotuses with golden petals and beryl stems, {{page:{number:2115,id:UT22084-068-021-102144,folio:F.205.a,volume:V71}}} and the environment abounds with trees of beryl. The following eleven lotus ponds can be found there: Blooming Park, Full of Lotuses, Timely Moving Lotuses, Covered by Red Lotuses, Sun Enjoyer, Smooth Ground, Unwavering, Great Trees, Deep, Fragrant Flowers, and Constant Water. This peak is also known as Covered by Lotuses. The rivers that flow through the area are endowed with various exquisite scents and flavors. Indeed, they are endowed with the six kinds of taste. All the pleasure groves with their life forms, trees, flowers, rivers, and bathing ponds are just as described previously. In this way, observing the fifth peak, he correctly considers the external body. And thus, observing the fifth mountain on Kuru in the north, known as Lofty Summit, he develops a correct understanding of the external body.

All experience their own share of karmic action, supported by their own karmic actions. They are born there due to their own positive actions and when those actions are exhausted, they are certain to fall. Then, due to unvirtuous karmic actions, they will take birth in the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. Positive actions will make them take birth among gods and humans. The people who live in the area of Lofty Summit are called the pleasure enjoyers; {{page:{number:2116,id:UT22084-068-021-102145,folio:F.205.b,volume:V71}}} they are always absorbed in the insatiable enjoyment of pleasures. There is a verse on this:
{{milestone:{label:5.347,id:UT22084-068-021-8347}}}“As with fuel and fire,
And water and the sea,
Craving will never be sated through pleasures,
And thus desires are never fulfilled.
{{milestone:{label:5.348,id:UT22084-068-021-8348}}}“The spiritual practitioner will see by means of the stainless eye that whatever these sentient beings enjoy is actually the cause of tears. And yet they do not understand—all conditioned factors are of the nature of suffering. Everything is subject to exhaustion and cessation. All of this is meaningless and brings no light. None of this is ultimate happiness. It brings no well-being and no peace. Life, youth, health, and possessions as enjoyed by these sentient beings do not bring any happiness and they are not pure. They are impermanent, have no self, and lack essence, just like foam and bursting bubbles. Everyone alive is destined to die. All wealth will end in destitution. When the sun has risen it is bound to set, and thus, likewise, all these higher realms will surely give way to the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, animals, and humans. Whatever is born is certain to die. When the land is fresh and lush, all the trees, forests, parks, and ponds are also like that. Yet, as the land ages, so do the trees, forests, parks, ponds, and lotuses. That which was lush in spring has grown old by the time autumn rolls around. All the young are bound to age, {{page:{number:2117,id:UT22084-068-021-102146,folio:F.206.a,volume:V71}}} and yet the people of Kuru in the north do not understand this. Similarly, when it rains at night, the rivers swell, flowing strongly along both banks because of the downpour. In the autumn, all wealth is exhausted and depleted due to the diminishing water, while in the summer, the wealth appeared as the rains fell at night. When the summer rains come to a halt, the rivers will run dry in the autumn, and thus privation follows to the same degree that the water diminishes. In this way, in terms of external things, lotuses bloom flawlessly in the summertime and are relished by the bees. Yet, in winter, there is snow and the bees no longer can enjoy any flowers. In the summertime, the flowers are always healthy but in the winter that is not the case. Similarly, these sentient beings are destroyed by craving, but they have not the slightest idea about their own imminent destruction. In this way, keenly observing the forests, parks, trees, cascades, bathing ponds, pools, vidyādharas, animals, birds, mountainous retreats, and washing places on the mountain called Lofty Summit, the practitioner correctly considers the external.

In this way their bodies exhibit vivid colors that are created by their karmic actions. The bees and birds there thus have many different appearances and feathers, and they produce a rich variety of delightful sounds. Their colorful bodies are all created by a variety of karmic actions. There are also numerous flowers that appear with a variety of colors, fragrances, and formations. {{page:{number:2120,id:UT22084-068-021-102149,folio:F.207.b,volume:V71}}} These accord with the character of the karmic actions engaged in by the people. The trees also have many different forms and fragrances. In accord with the inhabitants of Kuru in the north, the ornamented trees, rocks, streams, and bathing ponds are all endowed with sundry pleasures that manifest in whichever colorful form one may wish for. Because of their past positive actions, the inhabitants of Kuru in the north can play and celebrate among precious substances, enticing rivers of food and drink, and stunning trees and landscapes. The people who live on Garland-Draped Mountain in Kuru are also known as ‘the ever-infatuated.’ Except for the fact that the gods do not close their eyes and have no flesh, bone, lymph, or skin, the ever-infatuated people of Garland-Draped Mountain are just like the gods who celebrate at the feet of the Pārijāta tree during the four months of summer.

Because of such infatuations, they do not practice any positive activity of body, speech, or mind. Yet due to residual past positive actions, they are later born as gods. Once they die and transmigrate from the world of the gods, they are born among hell beings, starving spirits, animals, or humans, {{page:{number:2121,id:UT22084-068-021-102150,folio:F.208.a,volume:V71}}} because craving is like the strongest poison mixed with food, bringing torture, bondage, and misery to sentient beings.

They are like a snare hidden in the soil, but sentient beings do not understand that. They are like a precipice—everything is lost, death is painful, and the pains are incomparable. With the force of a waterfall in the mountains, all is in flux and thus youth is impermanent. No situation is stable and unchanging—there is no such context anywhere in the five realms of beings. The cyclone of flawed action keeps whirling, over and over, and yet living beings do not even feel sad. In this way, correctly observing the ever-infatuated people who live on Garland-Draped Mountain, he correctly considers the external body.

These twenty{{note:{index:633,id:UT22084-068-021-8359}}} flower species bloom during late spring, and it is due to the positive karmic actions of the people of Kuru in the north that they blossom in late springtime on Seasonal Joy Mountain.

As the wheel of time spins, their lives are cut short. The fire of time consumes the fuel of their lives. The thunderbolt of time destroys the crops of their lives. The lion of time subdues and devours these deer-like people. The time of the Lord of Death is like a torrent surging against the trees of the people and destroying them. Time is like wolves or snakes, killing people off. The Lord of Death takes lives like an elephant devouring katapata grass. The Lord of Death is like a storm cutting down the trees of human beings at their roots. Why does everyone not understand that these terrors of the Lord of Death are inevitable? He harbors enmity for all beings in the prime of life, extinguishes all their strength, and mocks everyone with aging, yet people do not see that. He humbles them with their physical condition and lays waste to their eyes, ears, noses, tongues, bodies, and minds. He causes them to drool and makes their backs crooked. He destroys their jaws, teeth, skull, joints, vital points, and intestines. He ensures that they will be unable to move about freely. He is the adversary of all youth. He conquers all who are young. The Lord of Death forces them to enter his city where he proceeds to destroy all their joy, strength, and happiness.

They are extremely close to shock and terror. Their psychophysical elements will all become imbalanced and the functioning of their faculties as well as their intestines, marrow, vital fluids, skin, blood, flesh, fat, bones, and semen will all dry up. The enemy of disease will attack their vital fluids. Whether they stand or sit, their experiences will be unbearable. They will desperately seek relief through medicine and doctors, but anything they eat, drink, swallow, or ingest will turn to waste. They will become emaciated, weak, and sleep most of the time. Their bodies will become nothing but skin and bone. Everyone—along with their family, friends, relatives, children and spouse—will plunge into these terrors of disease that are as agonizing as the Lord of Death himself. With this understanding, the spiritual practitioner becomes lovingly concerned for these careless people. As his empathy grows, he also takes the abodes of Brahmā as the focus of his attention: love, compassion, and joy. This is how the spiritual practitioner becomes lovingly concerned for the careless people of Kuru in the north. He sees the nature of cyclic existence as exceedingly base. He regards the body as if it were foam or water bubbles. He regards illusory consciousness by means of wakefulness. He regards all wealth as being like that in a dream.

Known as Holder of Joy, this mountain extends one thousand leagues and is home to the forest known as Overflow, which measures five hundred leagues. In the forest there are all sorts of riches, such as gold, silver, copper, wine, honey, and the six tastes, as well as many other natural resources.

Numerous beautiful birds live in such ponds, which are filled with lotuses that are red like the color of the rising sun. There are swans, cranes, small cranes, lake cranes, ducks, deer necks, water birds, matabhāva, blavā, cakravāka, bālukā, ādyā, sārasī, vilvalā, timely callers, uṣṇavīrava, night roamers, lotus pollen-lovers, sindhu waves, and wave-born ones.

Why do they not see that? Due to their carelessness, they roam about carelessly, which will later cause them to cry in the hells. Yet they do not understand this. Tied by the noose of craving, sentient beings engage in flawed conduct of body, speech, and mind. The ripening of such actions will make them take birth among hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. In precise accordance with their actions, they will then be destroyed—wailing and wretched—in the hells of Reviving, Black Line, Crushing, Howling, Great Howling, Heat, and Intense Heat. Tied by their fivefold craving for desirable sounds, textures, tastes, forms, and smells, they keep spinning in cyclic existence.

This mountain is one thousand leagues high. A tremendously delightful feature of that mountain is the fact that kiṃnaras always sing among its peaks and throughout its forests, parks, slopes, caverns, ponds, ketaka forests, nāga forests, nārikela forests, panasa forests, myrobalan forests, āmra forests, plantain forests, glorious golden fruit tree forests, kappittha forests, peacock forests, cuckoo forests, parrot forests, rivers, bathing ponds, parks, lotus groves, blue lotus groves, five-leaved chaste tree forests, thorn apple forests, mango groves, kurara forests, living forests, taṇḍaka forests, and lovely pools. Everywhere can be heard precious melodies that enchant the ears of everyone and that increase the fire of craving one hundred times in the minds of childish beings who are overcome by craving. Such are the songs of the kiṃnaras. Their tunes are so lovely that even the wild animals join in and begin to sing. Likewise, the flocks of birds that live in the forests also join the playful festivities. They also swallow fruits that are always full of elixirs—elixirs which bees also drink. {{page:{number:2129,id:UT22084-068-021-102158,folio:F.212.a,volume:V71}}} Vidyādharas and divine ladies gather there in the sky to listen.

Such are the joys of the mountain called Delightful. All that the people see with their eyes and hear with their ears there is beautiful and majestic.

The luminescence from this high mountain bathes everything within a distance of two thousand leagues in a bright light. The splendor of that beryl light outshines even the colors of the gold and the green of the trees, thus giving the entire mountain a whitish hue. As an example, just as the splendor of the pure gold on Sumeru lends all the grass a golden color, so the splendor of the mountain known as Delightful lends everything a whitish hue.

They bear flower garlands, colored powders, perfumes, and ointments. Excited and infatuated, they dance, sing, and enjoy themselves to music. They have overcome the flaws of mutual envy and stinginess, have no sense of personal property, and are free from pride. The bodies of the people who appear whitish are adorned with garlands, powders, scents, and ointments. Enjoying the delightful music, song, and tunes of the gandharvas, they are all happy. Any wish or desire they have is granted just by thinking of it. They wear a wide range of unwoven fabrics, crystals, and striking ornaments. Whether they are asleep or awake, they always listen to the most lovely and enchanting, rich symphony of songs made by hundreds of thousands of birds. They also constantly enjoy the delicious fragrances arising from ponds with hundreds of different types of lotuses. Thus, the people who appear whitish enjoy the delightful effects that have been created by their own positive actions.

At that point, a skeletal entity, with a shape similar to a wooden bracelet, is formed. This is the seed for consciousness to enter the womb. Next, as the wind of karmic actions circulates within the uterus for a period of seven days, the oval shape emerges. As an effect of having given up taking the lives of others, consciousness will not transmigrate but remain in the womb. Over the course of another week, the fetus then develops into an oblong shape. Due to possessing karmic actions and afflictions, consciousness will continue to remain there in an obscured state. Thereafter, it takes another seven days for the lumpy flesh to develop. The mother’s urine and feces in the lower part of her abdomen, the various movements of her body, and her consumption of food are all painful for the fetus, which feels like sugarcane in a juice press. Meanwhile the lump of flesh enlarges, driven by the wind of karmic actions. Next emerge the five protrusions of the legs, arms, and head. Moreover, due to the circling of the winds of karmic actions, the embryo that was born in the womb will now transfer into the belly of the mother, a process through which the umbilical cord is formed. The umbilical cord emerges from the mother’s kidneys. At that point, whatever the mother digests, the fetus will receive through the umbilical cord, whether cold or warm, delicious or foul. The food consumed by the mother will thus sustain the baby through the umbilical cord. The baby then undergoes torturous sensations while in the womb and experiences, in particular, much filth. Still, unless the baby dies prematurely, the period amid the blood and urine in the womb will finally culminate in the tenth month, as the child emerges from the mother’s birth canal while its major and minor limbs are being squeezed like a sugarcane through a juice press. {{page:{number:2132,id:UT22084-068-021-102161,folio:F.213.b,volume:V71}}} Immediately upon birth, the infant feels tremendous pain due to the wind and rough textures. Also, once the child has been born, its mother will abandon it and go where she wants to, leaving the child to take its own thumb as a breast, and try to get milk from it. In this way, the child will have to fend for itself. Such is the time of infancy—later follows youth.

And yet, these humans still do not clearly understand the way karmic actions ripen. Alas, these careless people are subject to extreme suffering because they are born from the roots of the tree of horrendous suffering! Once born, they will experience heat, cold, hunger, thirst, exhaustion, humiliation, encounters with the unpleasant, separation from the pleasant, aging, and death. Within cyclic existence, they have been born into a condition of utmost suffering. Within cyclic existence, they must balance the uncertainty of wealth and destitution. Cyclic existence is impermanent, painful, empty, and devoid of self. The mountains, forests, cool abodes, groves, parks, streams, trees, birds, flowers, fruits, mountains, cliffs, and precious stones are all going to disappear—why don’t the people of Kuru in the north understand this? {{page:{number:2133,id:UT22084-068-021-102162,folio:F.214.a,volume:V71}}} There will be pain and loss, and with time, everything will be reduced to dust. Even this northern continent of Kuru will become nothing. With the passage of time, all these people will emerge in the world of the gods, and from there, they will be born among hell beings, starving spirits, and animals, because they must all experience their individual shares of karmic action. Seeing the ripening of the effects of karmic action in this light, a spiritual practitioner develops loving concern for the people who appear whitish, because he sees that the nature of cyclic existence is vile.

It extends across one thousand leagues. On this mountain, Endowed with Lotuses, lies a five hundred-league-wide lotus lake known as Endowed with Cool Water. The lake is full of golden lotuses, free from mud, and adorned with bees, swans, ducks, and cakravākas. On this lotus lake grow heavenly lotuses, divine mandāravas, and kusumas.

Likewise, they are also mutually adorned by various people and draped with nets of larger and small bells. The people sing, dance, laugh, play drums, and are ever jubilant. The palaces are surrounded by rivers of grape wine and everywhere among the palaces stretch groves and parks. Thus, the eighty-four thousand palaces on Endowed with Lotuses appear just like the assembly hall of the gods, Sudharma, in the divine city of Sudarśana. The glories of the forests, parks, ponds, trees, and fruits are all just as described before. The people who live at Endowed with Lotuses are known as the colorful.

Since the colorful people live in carelessness, they are insatiable in their pursuit of sounds, textures, tastes, forms, and scents. Their craving makes them attached and controls them. They are carried away by the river of craving, the fire of desire consumes them, and they are plunged into the darkness of ignorance—thus, they do not realize the facts of exhaustion and decline. Aging makes the young decrepit; it leads to destruction. This terrible onslaught will sweep away all family, friends, and companions, and burn down the tree of life.

When he later dies and passes from such divine realms, he is then born in this place, where he can enjoy the sounds, textures, tastes, forms, and scents found here. {{page:{number:2138,id:UT22084-068-021-102167,folio:F.216.b,volume:V71}}} Then, such beings will once again be born in the heavens.

Due to having listened to the Great Vehicle, and by practicing what they have heard, they will also achieve the second concentration. In this way, they will be born in the realms of Limited Light, Limitless Light, and Luminosity. Again, the seed of having listened to the Great Vehicle—along with their observance and practice of the teachings that they heard—will make them achieve the third concentration, and so they will be born in the realms of Limited Virtue, Perfected Virtue, and Limitless Virtue. Thereafter, the seed of having heard the Great Vehicle—along with their continuous practice and mastery of the Great Vehicle, and their deep familiarity with all its principles—will make them achieve the fourth concentration. Thus, they will be born in the Cloudless Heaven, Increased Merit, and Great Fruition. The fire of wakefulness, free from desire, will then incinerate the trees in the wildwood of the afflictions, and so they will take birth in the heavens of Unlofty, No Hardship, Sublime, Gorgeous, and the Highest Heaven. Moreover, the seed of having heard the Great Vehicle—along with their observance and practice of the Great Vehicle, and their complete familiarity with this vehicle—will enable them to dispel the wrong views of sentient beings and establish them in the authentic view. In this way, the seed of having heard the Great Vehicle may transform them into solitary buddhas who have destroyed the prison of existence, or it may ripen as the mind of true and complete awakening. They may also become bodhisattvas who are fully immersed in the mind of unsurpassable great compassion, the source of happiness for all beings. In this way, the very seed of having listened to the Great Vehicle {{page:{number:2139,id:UT22084-068-021-102168,folio:F.217.a,volume:V71}}} will at that time turn them into bodhisattva great beings, and into buddhas—learned and virtuous, blissful ones, knowers of the world, unsurpassed beings, charioteers who guide beings, teachers of gods and humans, blessed buddhas.
{{milestone:{label:5.384,id:UT22084-068-021-8387}}}“All that follows because the seed of having listened to the Great Vehicle is rooted in generosity, discipline, and hearing. And how is that so? Because hearing grounds one in the Great Vehicle. Yet, if one dedicates this toward the awakening of a solitary buddha or toward the awakening of a hearer, then such awakenings will follow. Monks and householders practice generosity because of having heard about the fruits of generosity, and they practice discipline because of having heard about the fruits of discipline. They become familiar with wakefulness because of having heard about the fruits of wakefulness.
{{milestone:{label:5.385,id:UT22084-068-021-8388}}}“Therefore, the higher realms and liberation are both rooted in hearing the Great Vehicle. Hence, among all forms of generosity—such as giving freedom from fear, material things, and discipline—the proclamation of the Great Vehicle is supreme. Similarly, among all types of discipline, the discipline of listening to the Great Vehicle is supreme. The Great Vehicle is the source of all hearers, solitary buddhas, and thus-gone ones. Therefore, always listen to the Great Vehicle!

As he beholds all those regions, he will notice that the rivers, trees, ponds, and parks are just as exquisite as before. This continent is square, and so are the faces of its people. Likewise, Jambudvīpa is triangular and the faces of the humans in Jambudvīpa have a similar shape. The same type of relationship obtains in Kuru in the north. {{page:{number:2141,id:UT22084-068-021-102170,folio:F.218.a,volume:V71}}}

Extremely treacherous and terrifying, this ocean is the abode of rich nāgas that are very angry and aggressive. Beyond the Conch Sound ocean lies another ocean called Pervasive Waters. Normally, this ocean measures ten thousand leagues, but it may extend a further ten, twenty, or thirty leagues due to the wind. {{page:{number:2142,id:UT22084-068-021-102171,folio:F.218.b,volume:V71}}} Far beyond Pervasive Waters lies an island called Śukati Pearls.

Beyond Śukati Pearls lies a mountain called Jewel Friends, which measures five thousand leagues. The summits of that mountain contain the seven precious substances, and with its beryl and numerous other gems it is like a second Sumeru. Beyond Jewel Friends stretch two thousand leagues of flowering forests full of all sorts of delights.

How were they weak in discipline? In past lives, those people were poor and would only observe the one-day precepts for a price, and they only bowed their heads to the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha for fear of royal punishment and not out of faith. Nor did they properly practice generosity. For the sake of serving the king, they failed to train their minds and they did not recite the words of the Buddha. In order to serve the king, or out of greed, they were generous toward those with wrong view or improper recipients.

All that is due to the conditions of the seeds of their past karmic actions.
{{milestone:{label:5.396,id:UT22084-068-021-8403}}}“Sentient beings go wherever their karmic actions take them and they experience their individual allotments of karmic actions. They are involved in karmic actions and live lives of karmic action. Whether their past actions were virtuous or unvirtuous, their present fortunes are determined by those very actions. Those who practiced unvirtuous activities are born among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. Karmic effects resemble their seeds, just as the kodrava seed produces a kodrava grain, and not wild millet, and barley seeds produce barley crops. Likewise, from inferior qualities and inferior fields stem inferior effects. And similarly, good crops grow from good seeds—red rice from red rice seeds, mung beans from mung bean seeds, and sugarcane from sugarcane seeds.

Those that are free from water moss are intermediate; those that are free from grass and water moss, and not prone to water problems or bandit attacks, are superior; {{page:{number:2146,id:UT22084-068-021-102175,folio:F.220.b,volume:V71}}} those that are damaged by reeds{{note:{index:638,id:UT22084-068-021-8405}}} and water moss, and are prone to water problems, terrors, and bandit attacks, are inferior—unless farmers clear and cultivate them.

They are subject to external powers, serve as each other’s conditions, and produce one another. The people in Godānīya in the west experience the effects of stained karmic actions; they are born there due to stained karmic actions.

No other species of sentient beings live in that sea because they all die when exposed to the poisonous breath of the snakes. The water is warm because of the poison. Next comes the ocean of Red Water, covering five thousand leagues and inhabited by nāgas and subterranean asuras who live in mutual animosity.

Therefore, quick, quick, you must grow disenchanted with cyclic existence! Do not crave and yearn for cyclic existence! Cyclic existence is painful. It is a burning agony, an excruciating agony, a painful agony. It is full of aging, death, pain, lamentation, suffering, and unhappiness. It ends in a fall and is a gateway to exhaustion.

Based on such actions, they are born on this continent. Those of intermediate status practiced inferior discipline. In this regard, they may have given up killing in order to serve the king, rather than due to pure motivation. When their bodies disintegrate, such causes and conditions lead them to be born in an intermediate way among the gods in the joyous higher realms. {{page:{number:2155,id:UT22084-068-021-102184,folio:F.225.a,volume:V71}}} Superior individuals, however, proceed based on superior karmic actions. That is to say, they listen to the Great Vehicle, accomplish it, and rejoice in it. Apart from those who listen to the Great Vehicle, teach it, rejoice in it, and accomplish it, I have not seen a single person who escaped the jungle of cyclic existence. This is supreme generosity—letting the Great Vehicle be heard is supreme generosity. This is supreme insight—the insight of listening to the Great Vehicle is supreme. The benefits of proclaiming the Great Vehicle are just as these were explained previously.
{{milestone:{label:5.418,id:UT22084-068-021-8427}}}“Having seen the karmic action, phenomena, and ripening that pertain to sentient beings on Videha in the east, the spiritual practitioner will continue correctly considering the body and attending to it through the external body, and so will ask himself, ‘Might there be any other mountains or rivers around Videha in the east?’
{{milestone:{label:5.419,id:UT22084-068-021-8428}}}“With insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will then see that eight thousand leagues off the coast of Videha stands a mountain called Heap of Iron. This mountain rises three thousand leagues and its extremely subtle iron soil is scattered across ten thousand leagues. Beyond Heap of Iron Mountain stretches the ocean called Circular Design that covers seven thousand leagues. Circular Design is surrounded by five mountains: Needle Eye, Great Belly, Bhaṇḍanā, Snake, and Superior. Beyond the ocean of Circular Design lies an island called Endowed with Elements that measures three thousand leagues. {{page:{number:2156,id:UT22084-068-021-102185,folio:F.225.b,volume:V71}}} Here live vidyādharas, guhyakas, and kiṃnaras. This island is extremely delightful and has gorgeous rivers, ponds, and trees. The species of animals and trees found in Jambudvīpa and in Videha in the east are also represented on this island.
{{milestone:{label:5.420,id:UT22084-068-021-8429}}}“Far beyond that island towers a mountain known as Numerous Celestial Bodies, the summits of which are not very far from Sumeru. While the mountain is situated there, it can nevertheless be visible in Jambudvīpa due to the force of extraordinary karmic actions—namely the wind of virtuous or unvirtuous actions of the humans on Jambudvīpa. When the mountain is observed by brahmin scholars in Jambudvīpa, who have no understanding of the nature of karmic actions and results, they believe that it is caused by the planets or stars, and they proclaim this to the king and the royal ministers. However, that is only the perception of brahmin scholars who harbor wrong views. The auspiciousness of the planets, and the sun and moon, actually depends on virtuous or unvirtuous karmic actions. If the planets could indeed create auspiciousness, just as virtuous and unvirtuous karmic actions can, then, since the sun and the moon are such special celestial bodies, they should be able to govern auspicious and inauspicious times. Hence, there should be flowers and fruits during all seasons. But the sun and moon may also be eclipsed by another celestial body; Rāhu may interfere with the sun and the moon, and the other celestial bodies may also interfere with each other. Therefore, auspiciousness and inauspiciousness are not created by the planets or stars. Thus, the spiritual practitioner observes the behavior of the planets and the other celestial bodies, and carefully considers the body and attends to it through the external body, which is an effect of karmic action. As he observes the behavior of the planets, the appearance of Numerous Celestial Bodies in the sea, Mount Sumeru, and the appearance of the summits, {{page:{number:2157,id:UT22084-068-021-102186,folio:F.226.a,volume:V71}}} he correctly observes the external world.
{{milestone:{label:5.421,id:UT22084-068-021-8430}}}“The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it through the external body will also notice an island of gorgeous rocks, rivers, and trees, known as Bharata Abode, which lies seven thousand leagues into the sea beyond Numerous Celestial Bodies. All the trees, flowers, and fruits that grow in Jambudvīpa can also be found on this island, which measures three thousand leagues. Vidyādharas and guhyakas live among its wealth of delightful trees, flowers, and fruits.
{{milestone:{label:5.422,id:UT22084-068-021-8431}}}“Farther beyond looms Border Mountain, which marks the border between Videha in the east and the regions of Jambudvīpa. The water in the sea, which spans three thousand leagues, is cool. This sea between Videha in the east and Jambudvīpa is teeming with conches, great fish, nakra monsters, makara monsters, turtles, infant-eating crocodiles, kumbhīra monsters, and fish. Beyond Border Mountain stretches the sea known as Red. From the edge of Jambudvīpa, this cold sea of five thousand leagues appears red. Located not too far from Jambudvīpa, this sea abounds with fish and is filled with blood. When the fish feed and prey on one another, the killing makes the water become very bloody, thus turning it red. It is because of this red hue that the sea is called Red.
{{milestone:{label:5.423,id:UT22084-068-021-8432}}}“Beyond this sea extends another ocean, called Blue, which covers seven thousand leagues. {{page:{number:2158,id:UT22084-068-021-102187,folio:F.226.b,volume:V71}}} This ocean abounds with fish everywhere and is extremely deep. Thereafter stretches an ocean called Jewel Islands. Measuring three thousand leagues, it contains numerous mountains, jewels, golden sands, rocks, sasyaka gems, musāragalva rocks, pearl sands, vidrūma trees, sukumārikā gems, and other precious substances. There are also trees called sweet-poison-mind-transfer. The fruits of these trees are lethal for both birds and humans from Jambudvīpa, causing death within seven days of consumption. Any bird that eats this fruit will die. After that sea comes Salty, an ocean measuring eleven thousand leagues that is full of great fish, śukati, turtles, nakra monsters, crocodiles, nāgas, and birds. Numerous rākṣasas and piśācas roam there. White vidrūma trees grow out of the water and there are submarine seamounts.
{{milestone:{label:5.424,id:UT22084-068-021-8433}}} “Five hundred islands are found in the vicinity of Jambudvīpa. The primary ones among them are, for example, Golden Ground, Jewel Rocks, Ketaka, Mālikā, Conch, Pearl, Mekala Source, Plow, Place for Austerities, Excellent Forest, Peacock Forest, Fragrant Garlands, Triple Summits, Excellent Armies, Spānāśetu, Laṅkapuri Rākṣasas, Twelve Mountains, Bilvaka of Sumeru, Mountain Dwellings, Red Conches and Pearls, Snowy Regions, Silvery Sands, Roadless, {{page:{number:2159,id:UT22084-068-021-102188,folio:F.227.a,volume:V71}}} Five Fences of Gold and Other Materials, Śukti Realm, and Female Trees. These are all inhabited by humans. Such special regions surround Jambudvīpa, extending seven thousand leagues. The delights and mountains are like those mentioned before.
{{milestone:{label:5.425,id:UT22084-068-021-8434}}} “The spiritual practitioner who carefully considers the body and attends to it through the external body will also inquire about the reach of the light of the sun and moon. Thus, with insight derived from hearing or by seeing with the divine eye, he will see that the four faces of Sumeru and the four human abodes are all illuminated by the sun and moon. Moreover, within a distance of eighty-four thousand leagues from the faces of Sumeru, the first half of the sea is lit up by their light, but the second half lies in a terrifying, deep darkness. Farther out lies a chain of three hundred sixty million vajra mountains known as the Fence Ring, which are all ablaze with the unbearable flames of karmic actions. When the sea water approaches this ring, it first turns into milk, and as it comes still closer, the milk becomes yogurt, and then butter. When the butter touches the mountains, it melts and the liquid butter is then consumed by the fires of the hells. The liquid also floods the ground there.
{{milestone:{label:5.426,id:UT22084-068-021-8435}}}“Such indeed is the realm of desire, and this is how the spiritual practitioner correctly understands. With accurate knowledge and a perception of reality, he will conclude with perfect understanding that there is nothing here that is permanent, stable, enduring, or unchanging. {{page:{number:2160,id:UT22084-068-021-102189,folio:F.227.b,volume:V71}}} In cyclic existence, which knows no beginning or end, we experience our individual shares of karmic effects. Everyone suffers from the effects of their own actions. He will observe that there is no one who has not died and been reborn hundreds and thousands of times. When one correctly and continuously observes and attends to the internal body and the external body—the internal body and other bodies—one will no longer be attached to the body. Attractive sounds, tastes, forms, scents, and textures cannot bring one down.”
{{milestone:{label:5.427,id:UT22084-068-021-8436}}}In this way, the brahmins and householders of Nālati and all the monks who endeavored in the application of mindfulness of the body no longer remained in the presence of the māras. As they heard about the application of mindfulness of the body, a great many of them rid themselves of the cataract of the view of the transitory collection and achieved the eye of Dharma that sees the unsurpassable teachings.
{{milestone:{label:5.428,id:UT22084-068-021-8437}}}“Monks, you must teach the application of mindfulness of the body just as I have done here. These are the explanations to be given. Monks, in mountains, mountain retreats, mountain caves, charnel grounds, and in unsheltered places, you should practice concentration on your seat of straw! Do not remain careless! Make sure you have no regrets at the time of death! This is my instruction to you.”
{{milestone:{label:5.429,id:UT22084-068-021-8438}}}When the Blessed One had said this, all the monks rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One. This is the application of mindfulness of the body.
{{milestone:{label:5.430,id:UT22084-068-021-8439}}}This completes the noble Great Vehicle sūtra of thirty-six thousand that is known as The Application of Mindfulness of the Sacred Dharma. {{page:{number:2161,id:UT22084-068-021-102190,folio:F.228.a,volume:V71}}}

{{milestone:{label:c.2,id:UT22084-068-021-8444}}}India is the origin of all that is good and possesses all things excellent, both in terms of her soil and her sciences, for which she is the universal source. This is the land of the cultured and the learned and all her inhabitants are wise. Seeing India to be the eyes of Jambudvīpa, the perfect Buddha achieved full awakening within this land, with its magnificent cities through which the great river Gaṅgā descends.
{{milestone:{label:c.3,id:UT22084-068-021-8445}}}In the eastern part of India’s central lands lies the great monastery of Nālanda.{{note:{index:640,id:UT22084-068-021-8446}}} The sovereign of the land is the splendid prince Rāmapāla,{{note:{index:641,id:UT22084-068-021-8447}}} whose glory outshines others and whose reign reaches far and wide. This prince has established the temple known as Jagaddala to support the pure and the gentle, holy beings who are experts regarding the staircase leading to the higher realms and liberation. From here appeared numerous exceptionally learned paṇḍitas, such that people of the world speak of “the five hundred omniscient ones,” who are praised by all paṇḍitas as being equal to the masters of the past.
{{milestone:{label:c.4,id:UT22084-068-021-8448}}}Among them is someone whom kings and ministers, who take pride in their mundane wealth, carry on their shoulders as if he were their head—someone whom paṇḍitas, who take pride in their scholarship, and worldly folk regard as their crown jewel. He is regarded as a guide by those who have relinquished concern for this life and who endeavor to accomplish liberation, allowing them to clearly distinguish good qualities from flaws. All the people of the land see him as beautiful and endearing, as if he were their only child. He enraptures even the vicious and ungrateful with his great goodwill. {{page:{number:2162,id:UT22084-068-021-102191,folio:F.228.b,volume:V71}}} Due to his love for others, he suffers agony and pain as he beholds the miseries of all wandering beings, yet he skillfully extends his compassionate care to them. He is foretold in the prophetic discourse of Tiger Ear Star as an individual endowed with numerous qualities and a great instigator who upon exchanging his body would be born in the higher realms. He yearns to meet Maitreya and has tremendous yearning for the Dharma. He has also weakened all emotions such as desire and anger. Who could properly extol such a person’s qualities? In short, his knowledge of mundane human customs is great, and his benevolence is like a golden ground. With respect for the sacred Dharma, he is endowed with perfect learning and he is pure, serene, gentle, accommodating, noble, truthful, undeceiving, honest, and successful in terms of accomplishment. Like a majestic wish-fulfilling tree that grows from a turquoise ground, he is adorned with the blooming flowers and ripe fruits of a bounty of temporary and ultimate virtues in this and all other lives. Thus, perfectly accomplishing what benefits both oneself and all others, there is nothing that he does that is not meaningful. Such is this master endowed with the shining beauty of unimpeded mastery of the five fields of learning, the great paṇḍita known as Śāntākaragupta. Explanations based on five Indian volumes were received from that master, as well as the great scholar and holy man, the supreme Vinaya holder known as Abhayākaragupta; the one whose learning is comparable to Mañjuśrī, the supreme paṇḍita endowed with perfect eloquence and insight, Śakyarakṣita; and also the great paṇḍita Vīryākaraśānti, and others. {{page:{number:2163,id:UT22084-068-021-102192,folio:F.229.a,volume:V71}}}
{{milestone:{label:c.5,id:UT22084-068-021-8449}}}Likewise, in the lower reaches of the central land of Magadha—where the shrines of the thus-gone ones are numerous, and the land is full of Buddhists who have faith in the Three Jewels—lies the great monastic complex of Vikramaśīla. It was established by the bodhisattva king, Devapāla, and serves as the eyes of the Dharma teachings. Among its numerous learned scholars there are Śakyarakṣita himself; the great paṇḍita Subhūticandra, who is expert in linguistics, poetry, and the syntactic structures of Sanskrit; the Abhidharma expert known as Aḍitacandra; and other such masters. It is from all those masters that the explanations based on five Indian volumes were received.
{{milestone:{label:c.6,id:UT22084-068-021-8450}}}The translators listened carefully to the sūtra and with veneration they sought careful explanation in order to comprehend all the scripture’s words and meanings, thoroughly investigating the most difficult points with the appropriate methods for understanding their significance. In the process of translation, they were guided by the light of insight that comes from mastering four languages—Sanskrit, the Indian vernaculars, Tibetan Dharma language, and the Tibetan vernaculars.
{{milestone:{label:c.7,id:UT22084-068-021-8451}}}Nevertheless, the topics of the sūtras are numerous and the subjects are profound. In particular, the statements in this sūtra carry numerous implicit messages and convey their meaning by means of beautiful verbal adornments that evince an unparalleled mastery of poetry. Hence, their meanings are not easily accessible to those of weak learning. Especially, brief scriptural passages that convey numerous meanings have been translated in that same fashion. This approach allows those endowed with the jewels of understanding to ascertain numerous meanings, but if any one of those were to be singled out as the sole implied meaning, that would be a mistake. Rather, translation should convey just as much meaning as the words imply. Therefore, in short, without violating the way the Indian and Tibetan languages convey the same meaning by means of different expressions, and without breaking with the tradition established by the decrees of the scholars of the past, this translation has been made in veneration of the sacred Dharma by the northerner, the monk Tsultrim Gyaltsen, who was born into the family of Patshap. This was undertaken during the reign of the Indian king Rāmapāla, whose banner of perfect glory and majesty flies higher than any other. In this manner, those segments that had previously been translated of this Great Vehicle discourse known as The Application of Mindfulness of the Sacred Dharma were completed. {{page:{number:2164,id:UT22084-068-021-102193,folio:F.229.b,volume:V71}}}
{{milestone:{label:c.8,id:UT22084-068-021-8452}}}The subsequent editing and revision of the text was undertaken by the monk Tsultrim Gyaltsen himself, with the assistance of two others. The first is the spiritual teacher known as Shang Buchikpa, who everyone calls by this name because he benefits them and is auspicious for them, caring for all sentient beings as if they were his “only child.”{{note:{index:642,id:UT22084-068-021-8453}}} Accordingly, his name reveals that he is endowed with great compassion. The second editor is known as Sherap Ö, because he is a veritable “light of insight” for all who follow the Dharma.{{note:{index:643,id:UT22084-068-021-8454}}} With knowledge of the way the vehicles progress, he summarizes the teachings by means of principles such as the two realities, and thus—with insight developed gradually through conviction, ascertainment, and realization—he spreads the light that overcomes the darkness of afflictive and cognitive obscurations in both oneself and others. Thus, his name shows that this master is endowed with great insight and that he accomplishes his own and others’ objectives perfectly. In this way, the translation was corrected, refined, and properly finalized through the fivefold process of drafting, primary editing, testing the relations between word and meaning, secondary editing, and secondary testing of the relations.
{{milestone:{label:c.9,id:UT22084-068-021-8455}}}May the stainless virtues that ensue from translating and assisting in the translation of this sacred Dharma teaching—this precious discourse on mindfulness in the Great Vehicle, which is the foundation, root, and vital essence of all the vehicles—reach all beings extending to the end of space, so that they may find happiness while in existence. And may a lush canopy spread over them from the tree that offers refuge, awakening, and fruition. As soon as we leave this life behind, may we be reborn in realms of the buddhas, and in all other lives of cyclic existence, may we exclusively do what benefits others.
{{milestone:{label:c.10,id:UT22084-068-021-8456}}}The number of sections has not been determined. In accord with the Indian text the length of the scripture amounts to thirty-six thousand ślokas. There appear to be a few unique archaic elements of writing. When dividing The Application of Mindfulness into sections of three hundred ślokas, there are one hundred and twenty sections.
