Upholding the Roots of Virtue
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-32}} {{page:{number:1,folio:F.1.b}}} Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas!
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-34}} Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana, near Rājagṛha—an abode for those who practice concentration, an abode for those who do not abide, an abode for those who dwell in emptiness, an abode for those who dwell in signlessness, and an abode for those who dwell in wishlessness. The Blessed One was there together with a great saṅgha of one hundred thousand monks, all of whom talked only little, remained in solitude, and diligently practiced meditative seclusion.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-35}} At one point the venerable Śāradvatī­putra rose from his meditative seclusion {{page:{number:2,folio:F.2.a}}} and went before the Blessed One. He bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet and then sat to one side. Likewise did the venerable Mahā­maudgalyā­yana, the venerable Mahākātyāyana, the venerable Mahākauṣṭhila, the venerable Kapphiṇa, the venerable Mahācunda, the venerable Subhūti, the venerable Amogharāja, the venerable Vāṣpa, the venerable Nanda, the venerable Ānanda, the venerable Nandaka, the venerable Kimbhīra, {{note:{index:6,id:UT22084-048-001-36}}} the venerable Upagupta, the venerable Nārada, the venerable Vasiṣṭha, {{note:{index:7,id:UT22084-048-001-37}}} the venerable Mokila, and the venerable Upāli, along with five hundred others who had all gained mastery. They all now rose from their afternoon meditation session and went before the Blessed One, bowed their heads to his feet, and sat to one side.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-38}} A party including the venerable Yaśodatta , the venerable Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the venerable Marutpūjita, {{note:{index:8,id:UT22084-048-001-39}}} the venerable Yaśaskāma, the venerable Nandisena, the venerable Nandikāma, and five hundred other monks had been traveling from Śrāvastī where they had spent the rainy season. Now they arrived at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha. They also went before the Blessed One, bowed their heads to his feet, {{page:{number:3,folio:F.2.b}}} and sat to one side.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-40}} At that time another party consisting of the bodhisattva great being Ajita and one thousand bodhisattvas like him were likewise on the way from Campā where they had stayed during the rains retreat. When they arrived at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha they also went before the Blessed One, bowed their heads to his feet, and sat to one side.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-41}} Traveling at that time were also the bodhisattva great beings Bhadrapāla, Ratnākara , Susārthavāha, Guhagupta, Naradatta, Indradatta, Varuṇa, Brahmādeva, Balabhadra, Viśeṣamati, Vardhamānamati, Amoghadarśin , Susaṃ­prasthita, Suvi­krānta­vikrāmin, Nityo­dyukta, Anikṣiptadhura, Sūryagarbha, Jagatīṃdhara, Dharaṇīṃdhara, Amṛtaṃdhara, Susthitamati, Anantamati , Dṛḍhamati, Trailo­kyavi­krāmin, Anantavikrāmin , Apra­meya­vikrāmin, Vajra­pada­vikrāmin, Amogha­pada­vikrāmin , Acala­pada­vikrāmin, Mahāpratibhāna, Tīkṣṇa­prati­bhāna, Gambhīra­pratibhāna, Ananta­pratibhāna , Aprameya­prati­bhāna, Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta, Padmaśrīgarbha, Dharmodgata, Ratnapāṇi, Ratnadhara, Bearer of the Armor for Infinite Eons, Bearer of the Armor of Female Forms, Bearer of the Armor of Male Forms, Bearer of the Armor of the Forms of Sentient Beings, Infinite Leader, Unfathomable Leader , and Leader Destroying All Reference Points. {{page:{number:4,folio:F.3.a}}} All these bodhisattva great beings had equally donned the armor of activity, and while they had observed the rains retreat at different locations, they were now gathered in one group, and so they also arrived at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha. Upon their arrival, they went before the Blessed One, bowed their heads to his feet, and sat to one side.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-42}} Knowing that this gathering of bodhisattva great beings had assembled, the Blessed One performed a miraculous feat. Thus, by the doing of the Blessed One, all the monks and nuns, as well as all the male and female lay practitioners, who were present near the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by the city of Rājagṛha now approached the grove and the place where the Blessed One was. They came there in order to see the Blessed One, pay him their respect, and offer him their worship. As they arrived before him, they each bowed their heads to the feet of the Blessed One, and then sat to one side.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-43}} At that time Mahākāśyapa was dwelling in the Indra­śailaguha cave on Vaidehaka Mountain together with five hundred monks. They were all forest dwellers, receivers of alms, wearers of refuse rags, wearers of the three Dharma robes, upright dwellers, users of the grass mat, dwellers at the foot of trees, men of few desires, men of contentment, recluses, and wearers of inferior Dharma robes. Now, as the Blessed One effected his miraculous deed, Mahākāśyapa and the five hundred monks disappeared from the Indra­śailaguha cave on Vaidehaka Mountain and emerged at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha. Such was the Blessed One’s miraculous activity.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-44}} Perceiving the venerable Mahākāśyapa’s arrival from afar, {{page:{number:5,folio:F.3.b}}} the Blessed One said to his monks, “Monks, the elder Mahākāśyapa, who has just arrived, is a forest dweller, a receiver of alms, a wearer of refuse rags, a wearer of the three Dharma robes, a wearer of inferior Dharma robes, a hermit, a man of few desires, a man of contentment, a recluse, an incorruptible one, and a master of the entire Dharma. Monks, in terms of the ascetic practices, all my hearers should be equal or comparable to the monk Mahākāśyapa. Monks, since the monk and wearer of the three Dharma robes, Mahākāśyapa, does not even wish to speak with the gods, what need is there to mention his disinterest in human conversation.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-45}} When the Blessed One saw Mahākāśyapa arriving from afar, he said, “Kāśyapa, come here. Be welcome here, Kāśyapa. Ah, the elder Kāśyapa has traveled far to be here. Take this free seat, Kāśyapa.” As soon as the Blessed One had thus given a seat to the elder Kāśyapa, the Blessed One caused a tremor to arise from that seat, so that the entire trichiliocosm quivered, shivered, and trembled; vibrated, quaked, and moved; and rattled, shook, and convulsed. At the same time, the world became engulfed in a great light. Just as a jar of alloyed metal produced in Magadha emits a deep, reverberating sound when it is struck with an iron hammer, so too from the tremor arising from the seat he had just given to the venerable Mahākāśyapa, the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the Truly and Completely Awakened One likewise now caused a great sound to reverberate throughout the entire trichiliocosm. {{page:{number:6,folio:F.4.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-46}} The venerable Mahākāśyapa then draped his Dharma robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and, bowing toward the Blessed One, joined his palms in respect. He approached the Blessed One, bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet, and said, “Blessed One, you are my teacher, and I am your hearer. Thus, for us hearers it would not be appropriate to enjoy the Dharma robe, alms bowl, cushion, or any other object used by the Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the perfect Buddha himself. And why is that so? Because, Blessed One, for the entire world including its gods, humans, and demigods these serve as a basis for worship. {{note:{index:9,id:UT22084-048-001-47}}} Nor, Blessed One, shall I use the refuse rags that the Blessed One dons, because such garments serve as a basis for the worship of the Blessed One.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-48}} “Blessed One, from now on I shall not entertain any thoughts of desire, ill will, or malice. I shall not bring to mind any of the torments of desire, anger, or delusion. Blessed One, in short, for as long as I train, and until I have reached the ground of no more training, I shall place the Blessed One’s refuse rags at the crown of my head. Blessed One, such garments I do not receive for my enjoyment but for the sake of practicing the instructions and advice. Blessed One, as I take up such garments I think myself neither superior nor inferior. Blessed One, I do not think of the {{page:{number:7,folio:F.4.b}}} refuse rags as something to be worn on the body in the absence of Dharma robes. Blessed One, I do not think of the refuse rags as something that should be touched by unwashed hands. Blessed One, wherever I may be, I will always prostrate to the refuse rags. Blessed One, I do not think of the refuse rags as something that should be touched by any unclean limb. Blessed One, I bear the refuse rags as a basis for worship. Blessed One, that which I bear is what the Blessed One has relinquished and granted.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-49}} “Apart from the recollection of the buddhas, I do not engage in any attainment for the sake of abiding in some other state. As for the way that I abide, I do not identify earth as earth, water as water, fire as fire, or wind as wind. I do not have any notion of either this world or something that is beyond it. Blessed One, I do not form any notion about anything seen, heard, distinguished, cognized, conceived, or contemplated. Blessed One, the state free from perception, the state of the attainment free from perception, the state of the transcendence of perception, the state of the transcendence of freedom from perception, the state of perception, the state without perception, as well as the state of training and the state of no more training—none of these do I truly perceive. Blessed One, within this state I do not perceive any thus-gone ones, any qualities of the thus-gone ones, {{page:{number:8,folio:F.5.a}}} nor any state of the thus-gone ones. That is how I abide.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-50}} “Blessed One, take as an analogy the various names, signs, and designations for open space. Blessed One, in terms of such an application of names, signs, and designations, we may say ‘space’ and so employ a convention, sign, or representation. Blessed One, likewise, just as we may speak of ‘space,’ we may also say ‘the open,’ ‘the empty,’ ‘the void,’ ‘the hollow,’ ‘the essenceless,’ ‘the ungraspable,’ ‘the limitless,’ ‘the unsupported,’ ‘that which cannot be adopted,’ ‘that which cannot be discarded,’ ‘the bodiless,’ ‘the actual,’ ‘the completely pure,’ ‘mid-air,’ ‘the unimpeded,’ ‘the insubstantial,’ ‘what cannot be shown’—or any other such convention. Nevertheless, Blessed One, no name, sign, or representation can be employed to successfully delineate, determine, compare, or distinguish space. Blessed One, wherever we may look, we will not find any color, shape, or objective referent whereby space can be demarcated or contained.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-51}} “Similarly, Blessed One, we may say ‘the Thus-Gone One,’ ‘the Buddha,’ ‘the Teacher,’ ‘the Refuge,’ ‘the Protector,’ ‘the Support,’ ‘the Guide,’ ‘the Leader,’ ‘the Perfect Leader,’ ‘the Doctor,’ ‘the Healer,’ ‘the Revealer of the Path,’ ‘the Teacher of the Path,’ or make use of some other name or convention. {{page:{number:9,folio:F.5.b}}} In that way the learned may praise, venerate, extol, laud, and applaud the Blessed One. Yet whichever mundane quality they may express through words and conventions in this way, this will not make me cognize, regard, or perceive the Blessed One. And why is that so? Because, Blessed One, all phenomena are by nature hollow and without essence.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-52}} “Blessed One, take the analogy of a magician who conjures a universal monarch—a king who has received the royal anointment, is the master of the four divisions of the army, and is in possession of the seven precious treasures. Blessed One, that magically produced monarch may then be engaged in the subjugation of all the beings that inhabit that universe of four continents, and he may succeed in vanquishing that infinite amount of beings. Blessed One, the monarch’s body is distinct, and the bodies of the sentient beings are likewise seen as distinct. However, Blessed One, the magically conjured universal monarch will certainly not be thinking, ‘I shall be the master of this great army! I shall rule this world of four continents!’ And the four divisions of the army will certainly also not be thinking, ‘That universal monarch is our leader, so we must follow him!’ And yet they do follow him.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-53}} “Similarly, Blessed One, that which is the intrinsic nature of phenomena does not exist as a blessed thus-gone one, a hearer, someone training, someone not training, a solitary buddha, or an ordinary being. Blessed One, within the intrinsic nature there is {{page:{number:10,folio:F.6.a}}} no observation, perception, or apprehending of the thus-gone ones’ intrinsic nature. There is no observation, perception, or apprehending of the solitary buddhas’ intrinsic nature. There is no observation, perception, or apprehending of the hearers’ intrinsic nature. There is no observation, perception, or apprehending of ordinary beings’ intrinsic nature. There is no observation, perception, or apprehending of the intrinsic nature of form. Likewise, there is no observation, perception, or apprehending of the intrinsic nature of feeling, perception, formation, or consciousness. Blessed One, within the intrinsic nature, form is empty, form is empty thereby, and within that there is no observation of empty form. Likewise, herein feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness are also all empty, they are empty thereby, and within that there is no observation of them as empty. Similarly, herein the thus-gone one is empty, the thus-gone one is empty thereby, and within that there is no observation of the thus-gone one as empty. In the same way, the intrinsic nature of the thus-gone one is empty, the intrinsic nature of the thus-gone one is empty thereby, and within that there is no observation of the intrinsic nature of the thus-gone one as empty. Blessed One, in the same way, there is no hearer either, and no intrinsic nature of the hearer. There is no ordinary being and no intrinsic nature of the ordinary being.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-54}} “Blessed One, in the analogy of the magically produced universal monarch and his divisions of the army, there is neither any universal emperor nor any divisions of the army. {{page:{number:11,folio:F.6.b}}} They are not to be found within the illusion itself, the intrinsic nature of the illusion, or within the magician. They are not in earth, not in water, not in fire, not in wind, not in space, and not in consciousness. They are not within the elements of earth, water, fire, wind, or space. Nor are they within the element of consciousness. Blessed One, all phenomena are this way. Blessed One, I do not think about them, I do not produce them, and I do not speak of them. Blessed One, as I am in this way disengaged from desirable qualities, I recollect the qualities of the thus-gone ones.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-55}} “Blessed One, this is the path, this is the way. The noble sons and daughters who abide upon and have attained this path will not think, ‘I must engage in other trainings. I must search for other teachers. I shall follow other mendicants or brahmins as they teach. That other venerable one knows with insight, sees with vision, and applies the true view with mastery.’ Such thinking is not appropriate. Blessed One, since I have become certain about this, that is how I am. Since I have attained that gateway of the Dharma, that is how I am. This is how all phenomena are: they all share the same nature in terms of their voidness and unborn nature.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-56}} “Blessed One, I wish to bring my doubts about the Dharma before the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the perfect Buddha, and as the Thus-Gone One has given me the opportunity, I have come here to the Kalandaka­nivāpa from the Indra­śailaguha cave. Blessed One, {{page:{number:12,folio:F.7.a}}} I am here, and the Blessed One has granted me a seat. When he granted me a seat, this entire trichiliocosm reverberated and the ground trembled and shook in six ways.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-57}} “Blessed One, this is how I think: The Thus-Gone One is a tremendously great being in possession of the Dharma, the vast Dharma. Without any master, the Thus-Gone One is self-arisen, and yet he follows the way of great compassion. Free of special pride, without any pride, he has granted me a seat. This, I find, is a wonder.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-58}} “Blessed One, I think of the analogy of a poor man, who has been struggling to maintain the most basic livelihood. That man may toil hard and so end up with a fine home. At that point he may go before a king who has received the royal anointment and is the commander of an army of four divisions—he may go before such a king in order to see him, prostrate before him, pay him respect, and ask him questions. If, when the man arrives, the king then offers him a free seat the man will think, ‘I came here to see the king and pay my respects to him. Even an opportunity just to see the king and prostrate before him is rare, let alone the prospects of being able to ask him questions. Still, as soon as I arrived, this monarch who has received the royal anointment granted me a free seat. What a wonder this is!’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-59}} “Blessed One, you are the king of Dharma, a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha, self-arisen and without master. How may I wish what even for hearers and solitary buddhas is hard to achieve and hard to imagine, let alone for the world of gods, humans, and demigods? How is it that have I come here—before the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the perfect Buddha—to ask questions on the Dharma, to behold you, to prostrate, and to pay you my respects? {{page:{number:13,folio:F.7.b}}} Blessed One, this is how I think: I have succeeded in seeing the Thus-Gone One. I have succeeded in prostrating to him. I have succeeded in paying him my respects. I have succeeded in addressing him. I have succeeded in addressing him in full. As I now stand before the Blessed One, he has granted me a free seat. Indeed, my success is of the finest sort.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-61}} “Blessed One, when the poor man beholds the universal monarch he is filled with wonder, and, Blessed One, I too must marvel. Blessed One, this is how I think: The Thus-Gone One is endowed with great love, great compassion, great joy, and great equanimity. The qualities that the Thus-Gone One possesses are only his, the Teacher’s, and no one else’s. Yet the Thus-Gone One does not think himself special, supreme, or superior. What a wonder this is. I think of how the buddha qualities that belong to the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the perfect Buddha are not shared by any hearer or solitary buddha.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-63}} The Blessed One then spoke to the venerable Mahākāśyapa: “That is right, Kāśyapa, that is right. Kāśyapa, you are right. Kāśyapa, the thus-gone ones are boundless and endowed with boundless qualities. It is impossible to measure the extent of their generosity, and their transcendent generosity, and so on, through to their insight and their transcendent insight. Their aspiration, their transcendent aspiration, their means, their transcendent means, their activity, their transcendent activity, {{page:{number:14,folio:F.8.a}}} their liberation, their transcendent liberation, their vision of liberated wisdom, and their vision of transcendent liberated wisdom—these are all immeasurable.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-64}} “Kāśyapa, four factors pertain to the thus-gone ones’ unequaled wisdom. Due to their possession of those four factors, the thus-gone ones bring forth the lion’s roar in the midst of their retinue. Which are those four? They are the equality of discipline, the equality of absorption, the equality of insight, and the equality of buddha qualities. Kāśyapa, whoever is endowed with this fourfold wisdom of equality is a thus-gone one who proclaims the lion’s roar in the midst of their retinue.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-65}} The Blessed One then spoke the following verses:
“Buddhas throughout inconceivable worlds, Endowed with the infinite wisdom of buddhahood, Have purified the actions of the mind, And so proclaim the lion’s roar.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-67}} “In letting the lion’s roar resound, They terrify the extremists, Who when hearing of phenomena’s intrinsic nature Fall into the abyss.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-68}} “Those harboring the notion of self And the notion of a sentient being— Kāśyapa, such beings I declare To be extremists in terms of this teaching.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-69}} “Those keeping the notion of an entity And of ‘my self’— Kāśyapa, such beings I declare To be extremists in terms of this teaching.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-70}} “Those deluded beings Who conceitedly consider themselves disciplined, Concentrated, and learned— Those are extremists, Kāśyapa.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-71}} “ ‘I am content and have few desires; I remain in solitude And adhere to the simplest of Dharma robes’— Those who think this are extremists, Kāśyapa.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-72}} “Take the analogy of space: When a hand moves through space, it is unobstructed. Moreover, as for space, It can never be stained by dust. {{page:{number:15,folio:F.8.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-73}} “Likewise, Kāśyapa, those who practice This Dharma that I have taught Will not be stained by the afflictions; It is just as with space and dust, or clouds.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-74}} “People may offer flowers and incense, Or garlands and ointments to the sky, Yet the sky will not keep track, thinking, ‘Offerings that arise and cease are made to me.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-75}} “Space will not be stained, Its nature will not be stained— Its nature is devoid of any essence. To mendicants, so are all empty phenomena.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-76}} “Space will not be threatened, Nor will it ever be abused— To mendicants, this is how all phenomena are. Like space, they cannot be tarnished by anything.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-77}} “Mendicants who train well in this Dharma, While also showing others the points of training, Will never develop attachments. These I declare to be well-trained mendicants.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-78}} “Just as space cannot be blocked by the hand, Nor sullied by dust or smoke, And just as its path cannot be altered, So are mendicants who trust the Dharma accordingly. {{note:{index:10,id:UT22084-048-001-79}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-80}} “Across the cloudless sky The moon travels unhindered, Yet it does so without thinking, ‘I shall illumine this space.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-81}} “Likewise, when, free from agitation, moon-like mendicants Visit the households of benefactors Their minds should be liberated, free from excitement and pride, And unstained by any mundane phenomenon.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-82}} “Having abandoned pride they thus visit the households, And once there they speak the Dharma. Having given up desire for pleasures and acquisitions, {{page:{number:16,folio:F.9.a}}} They live in the world by pure discipline.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-83}} The Blessed One then spoke to Mahākāśyapa: “Stand up, Kāśyapa. Stand up and go take your seat. Kāśyapa, whatever doubts you may have about the Dharma, you must bring them before the Thus-Gone One. Kāśyapa, I shall answer your questions and delight your mind.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-85}} The venerable Mahākāśyapa then rose from where he had been kneeling, bowed his head to the feet of the Blessed One, and took a place at one side. Once more the Blessed One performed a miraculous act, so that all the monks and nuns as well as all the male and female lay practitioners in Jambudvīpa now came to the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha. They approached the site where the Blessed One was, and as they arrived, they bowed their heads to the Blessed One’s feet and then sat to one side.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-86}} Miraculously, the Blessed One next caused all the monks, nuns, male lay practitioners, female lay practitioners, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas to enter the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana and, as they entered, this limitless and boundless mass of beings gained insight. The Blessed One then proceeded to perform more miraculous acts. Thereby, from the entire trichiliocosm, the four great kings, King Śakra of the gods, Brahmā, Mahābrahmā, as well as all the divine sons of the heavens of Luminosity, Unlofty, No Hardship, Excellent Vision, and Unexcelled arrived at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha due to the power of the Buddha. As they arrived, they proceeded to the place where the Blessed One was residing. {{page:{number:17,folio:F.9.b}}} Having bowed their heads to the Blessed One’s feet, they sat to one side, facing the Blessed One with their palms joined in homage.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-87}} The Blessed One then performed further miraculous acts. Thus, by the power of the Buddha, there now appeared the kings of the nāgas—Sāgara, Anavatapta, Kambaleśvara, Gautama, Nanda , Upananda, Manasvin, Takṣaka, Sundara, and Elapatra—accompanied by a billion other nāgas. They all went before the Blessed One, bowed their heads to his feet in homage, and sat to one side.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-89}} In this way, by the power of the Buddha, such a vast gathering of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, monks, nuns, and male and female lay practitioners had now come together at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana. Everyone entered the grove and took a place there without any anxiety about one another. Such was the Blessed One’s miraculous activity.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-90}} The Blessed One now addressed the venerable Maudgalyāyana: “Maudgalyāyana, stand up and prepare a seat for the Thus-Gone One. Seated there, the Thus-Gone One shall deliver the Dharma discourse known as ‘Cutting Through All Doubts.’ He will display the activity that fulfills the wishes of all sentient beings. He will deliver a teaching of the Dharma that satisfies all sentient beings. He will reveal the ocean seal that leads all sentient beings to merge with the Dharma. He will explain how to accomplish the activities of all bodhisattva great beings. {{page:{number:18,folio:F.10.a}}} He will explain the way to cultivate the qualities of the buddhas. He will explain the practices that bring sentient beings to maturity. He will explain how to practice transcendent generosity up until transcendent insight. He will explain the practice of the door to the way of all phenomena. He will show the accomplishment of the lord of all beings. He will show the accomplishment of the activities pertaining to the states of all beings. He will satisfy the four retinues. He will satisfy the retinue of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas. He will teach just a fraction of the wisdom that is unhindered and unimpeded with regard to past, present, and future. He will teach just a fraction pertaining to the ripening of karmic action, as well as to activity, aspiration, and wisdom.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-92}} The venerable Maudgalyāyana rose from his seat and bowed his head to the feet of the Blessed One. He then emanated a seat for the Blessed One that was as large as the world of Brahmā. In the sky above he emanated a courtyard for the Blessed One made of the seven precious substances that was as smooth to the touch as kācalindika fabric. The courtyard was as vast as a thousandfold universe, and it extended for a distance of seven hundred leagues. Surrounding the courtyard were seven fences, seven arches, seven ledges, and seven layers of lattices made of bells and bangles. To its sides he emanated trees of four precious substances: gold, silver, crystal, and beryl. The trees of gold {{page:{number:19,folio:F.10.b}}} had silver leaves, crystal flowers, and beryl fruits; the trees that were of silver had golden leaves, flowers of beryl, and fruits of crystal; the beryl trees had leaves of gold, flowers of silver, and fruits of crystal; and the crystal trees had leaves of gold, silver flowers, and beryl fruits. Between the trees were ponds filled with water endowed with the eight qualities. Leading to the water were four steps, each of them made of precious substances: gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. Sand of gold was strewn, and in the ponds blossomed blue, pink, red, and white lotuses. In the sky above, he emanated a latticed canopy made of the seven precious substances. The courtyard was decorated with numerous silken tassels, the air was filled with pleasant wafts of incense, and there were beds of various flowers, each the size of seven people. Within each of the blue, pink, red, and white lotuses Maudgalyāyana created a monk who looked just like himself.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-93}} When the venerable Mahā­maudgalyā­yana had magically produced a seat of this sort, he went before the Blessed One and said, “Blessed One, I have prepared a seat for you. Please know that the time is now right.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-3943}} “Maudgalyāyana,” the Blessed One then asked, “have you finished arranging my seat?”
“Yes, Blessed One, I have,” replied Maudgalyāyana.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-96}} The Blessed One then addressed the bodhisattva great being {{page:{number:20,folio:F.11.a}}} Revealing the Accomplishment of Apprehending Infinite Objects: “Noble son, prepare a lion throne for the Thus-Gone One. Seated upon that throne, the Thus-Gone One shall deliver the Dharma teaching known as ‘Truly Satisfying All Sentient Beings.’ ”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-97}} Paying heed to the Blessed One, the bodhisattva great being Revealing the Accomplishment of Apprehending Infinite Objects then prepared a seat, and all the bodhisattvas who were in attendance likewise offered their own shawls to the seat, spreading them upon the lion throne.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-98}} Next the Blessed One formed the following intention: “In order to dispel the doubts and hesitations of these bodhisattvas, I shall produce a miracle. Based on their own Dharma robes, I will grant them a vision of their bodhisattva activities, engagements, aspirations, display of realms, and maturation of sentient beings. I shall let them perceive the features of the realms within which they are to awaken to true and complete buddhahood. Likewise, I shall let them see their perfect hearers, their perfect bodhisattvas, and their perfect Dharma teaching. I shall show them their perfect lifespan, perfect complexion, perfect form, perfect name, perfect marks, perfect endowments, and their perfect Dharma fearlessness.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-99}} Then, with his wisdom mind thus inclined, the Blessed One sat down upon his seat {{page:{number:21,folio:F.11.b}}} and entered the buddhas’ absorption known as revealing the accomplishment of apprehending infinite objects . As soon as the Blessed One had entered this meditative absorption, all the bodhisattvas who had placed their upper garments upon the Blessed One’s seat now came to perceive everything—from the perfect array of their own future buddha realm up to their perfect Dharma fearlessness—within each of their own shawls. Witnessing all this, the bodhisattvas were deeply gratified and delighted. Joyous and elated, with one voice they sang the following verses to the Blessed One:
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-100}} “O you of proper comportment and conduct, source of excellent qualities, Fearless master of all phenomena— Endowed with all excellent qualities, how beautiful you are! You are a masterful victor who abides in absorption.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-101}} “You are free from falseness and deceit. Knowing neither pride, agitation, nor pretense, You know the deeds related to knowledge and liberation. Abiding in this meditative absorption, how beautiful you are!
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-102}} “With fearless mastery you remain in meditation And so display unparalleled and unsurpassable miracles. Revealing your unhindered wisdom, With mastery, today you have disclosed the future.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-103}} “We now think we have attained the peace of the immutable stage; We now think we have entered awakening; We now think we have conquered the māras; We now think we have gained knowledge.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-104}} “We now think we have attained the supreme eye With which the victorious ones perceive the voidness of all things conditioned. By the kindness of your unhindered wisdom The eye sees, utterly unhindered.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-105}} “While perceiving distinctly, nothing is seen, And no phenomenon is threatening. When the mind is free from hostility {{page:{number:22,folio:F.12.a}}} Then that is the supreme buddha eye.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-106}} “With the victor’s supreme buddha eye The three realms are known and accessed without any hindrance. With a mind in which entity and non-entity are equal You display true diligence, resting within your own vision.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-107}} “When the Victorious One entered this absorption, He made everyone feel that they had gained accomplishment. {{note:{index:11,id:UT22084-048-001-108}}} All achieved these gateways of retention As well as the supreme gateway of Dharma liberation.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-109}} “Having entered the gate, become skilled, and achieved purity, The mind of the Victorious One shall never decline. Such is the ripening of great generosity. Such are the qualities of great discipline.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-110}} “Such are the qualities of great insight. Thus, having relied upon these teachings in the past, As you took your seat and practiced concentration, Lord of men, you shone throughout the ten directions.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-111}} “Victor, all aspects of death, transference, and karmic action, As they will be for this gathering of your heart children, Became clearly evident today For all gods, nāgas, nonhumans, and kiṃnaras.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-112}} “Within this illuminating absorption Arose knowledge across eons. Thus, clearing away doubts and hesitations, The best of humans will speak with the voice of a lion.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-113}} “Pursuing the welfare of self and others He has been generous in the past. Generous, disciplined, patient, and diligent— Throughout eons, he has practiced for all beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-114}} “Without any gratitude from sentient beings He is generous, disciplined, patient, and diligent, Displaying great skill for the sake of all beings. In this way you enter absorption.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-115}} “With supreme insight you master such absorption. O hero, as today you took your seat, We joined our palms and requested You to cut through our doubt and dispel our hesitation.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-116}} “Today we have achieved the illumination of all phenomena. Free from doubt, we have achieved illumination. For us and for beings to come {{page:{number:23,folio:F.12.b}}} The way of the Dharma will endure for long.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-117}} This concludes the first chapter.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-118}} Present within the gathering was a youth by the name of Padmaśrīgarbha. He now rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One. As he faced the Blessed One, the following thoughts arose in his mind: “I wish to request the gateways of the Dharma from the Thus-Gone One. I wish to receive the vajra words. I wish to request the words for practice that are without interruption. I wish to request the words that overcome all other statements, the words of progressive discernment, {{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-048-001-119}}} the words wherein all teachings of the Dharma are contained. If the noble sons and daughters practice such a gateway seal, they will attain the stainless eye that sees all phenomena and they will gain expertise regarding the mind. Ah, Blessed One, in the past I have borne my armor through the accumulation of intentions and practical deeds. Thus, you will be aware of my roots of virtue from the past, arisen through the accumulation of intentions and applications.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-120}} Aware of the youth Padmaśrīgarbha’s thoughts and prayers, and aware of his practice of accumulating roots of virtue, the Blessed One now looked in the four directions, and at the same time four great light rays shone forth from his mouth. As this light emerged from the mouth of the Blessed One, it spread out into infinite and endless universes, and wherever the light reached—whether to trees, walls, mountains, earth, or the empty atmosphere—everything became suffused with a golden color. In this way the light shone unhindered throughout all the cardinal and intermediate directions. {{page:{number:24,folio:F.13.a}}} Throughout the trichiliocosm, wherever sentient beings were touched by this light their bodies became as if made of gold. Whoever was suffering from the torments of desire, anger, or delusion felt that those afflictions decreased. All beings within the trichiliocosm who were living in hell, suffering the unbearable, ceaseless torments of heat, now experienced relief from their pain due to the power of the Buddha and the power of the bodhisattva’s past prayers. Likewise, all beings within the trichiliocosm who were affected by the obscurations of karma, affliction, and the ripening of karma were freed from their obscurations by the power of the Buddha and the power of the bodhisattva’s past prayers.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-121}} Next, to intensely brighten the roots of virtue in sentient beings, the Blessed One projected great light from all the pores on his body. This great light traveled to the east, traversing infinitely many universes. Likewise, the same occurred in the south, west, north, zenith, and nadir: the light from the Blessed One shone forth and extended across infinitely many universes. The Blessed One then produced a special sound that likewise could be heard throughout all those universes.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-122}} At that point, in the east, beyond innumerable universes, there was a universe known as Single Parasol . Within that {{page:{number:25,folio:F.13.b}}} universe resided the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Single Jewel Ornament. Abiding and remaining present there, he taught the Dharma. The blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Single Jewel Ornament had prophesied that after himself the bodhisattva great being Jālinīprabha would awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-123}} Now the bodhisattva Jālinīprabha approached the blessed thus-gone Single Jewel Ornament and asked, “Blessed One, who made this special sound and what is the source of that great light?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-124}} The blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Single Jewel Ornament replied, “Noble son, to the west of this buddhafield, beyond innumerable world realms, there is a universe known as Enduring. Within that universe resides the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni. Abiding and remaining present there, he is delivering a Dharma teaching that belongs to the Bodhisattva Collection, known as ‘Truly Satisfying All Sentient Beings.’ Present in the gathering of the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni’s retinue is the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha. That bodhisattva wishes to request the gateway for accomplishing all syllables—the seal whereby one truly engages with all dharmas.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-125}} “Jālinīprabha, in that buddha realm, the retinue contains bodhisattva great beings who bear the inconceivable armor, {{page:{number:26,folio:F.14.a}}} the armor of undifferentiated activity. Jālinīprabha, the bodhisattva great beings who have donned such armor also benefit other buddha realms. Jālinīprabha, anyone born within the buddha realm of the thus-gone Śākyamuni will, upon seeing or hearing those bodhisattva great beings, be protected and cared for by them. Jālinīprabha, needless it is, then, to mention what will be the case when someone, upon seeing these bodhisattva great beings, proceeds to pay them respect, reveres them, venerates them, worships them, and asks them questions.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-126}} The bodhisattva great being Jālinīprabha then addressed the thus-gone Single Jewel Ornament: “Blessed One, I wish to go to that universe, so that I may see, venerate, and serve the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni, and so that I may see those bodhisattva great beings who bear the inconceivable armor.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-127}} “Noble son,” said the thus-gone Single Jewel Ornament, “if you know that the time is right, then go. But act with mindfulness when you remain in that buddha realm. Why do I say so? Because, noble son, the bodhisattva great beings of that realm are hard to approach.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-128}} The thus-gone Single Jewel Ornament then gave an utpala flower that was like a hand to the bodhisattva great being Jālinīprabha. “Jālinīprabha,” he said, “you should offer this hand-like utpala flower to the thus-gone Śākyamuni. Tell him that the blessed thus-gone Single Jewel Ornament {{page:{number:27,folio:F.14.b}}} inquires whether the Blessed One has encountered but little hardship and discomfort, and whether he remains healthy, strong, and at ease.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-129}} The bodhisattva great being Jālinīprabha bowed his head to the feet of the thus-gone one, the blessed buddha Single Jewel Ornament, and then circumambulated him three times. Accompanied by bodhisattva great beings beyond number and count, he next traveled to the world of Enduring, arriving there in a single instant of the mind. Once here, he proceeded to the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha, and the place where the Blessed One was residing. Bowing his head to the Blessed One’s feet, he said, “Blessed One, the bodhisattva Jālinīprabha bows his head to your feet in homage. Blessed One, I am Jālinīprabha. Bliss-Gone One, I am Jālinīprabha, and in homage I bow my head to your feet.”
“Jālinīprabha,” replied the Blessed One, “you shall live long, and you shall be happy and healthy.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-131}} Having in this way bowed to the Blessed One’s feet, the bodhisattva great being Jālinīprabha sat to one side and from there addressed the Blessed One: “Blessed One, the blessed thus-gone Single Jewel Ornament {{page:{number:28,folio:F.15.a}}} inquires whether the Blessed One has encountered but little hardship and discomfort, and whether he remains healthy, strong, and at ease. The blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Single Jewel Ornament also sends a hand-like utpala flower for the Blessed One. Blessed One, please therefore accept this hand-like utpala flower from the bodhisattva Jālinīprabha.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-132}} The Blessed One accepted the flower and then gave it to the bodhisattva Ajita. Holding the hand-like utpala, the bodhisattva Ajita turned to a group of five hundred that included the bodhisattva Bhadrapāla. “Kinsmen,” said the bodhisattva Ajita, “the Thus-Gone One has given us this hand-like utpala.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-133}} Bhadrapāla, leading the group of five hundred bodhisattvas, now held the hand-like utpala and addressed the Blessed One in the following way: “Blessed One, we have undertaken proper practices and carry out bodhisattva activities. Therefore, is anyone who hears our names certain to awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood? Blessed One, the bodhisattva Ajita has given us this hand-like utpala. Blessed One, relying on the power of our aspirations, activities, intentions, and resolve never to abandon sentient beings, we shall today toss this hand-like utpala in supplication of the Thus-Gone One. Blessed One, we likewise toss it before all the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas who remain and reside in the east. {{page:{number:29,folio:F.15.b}}} We also toss this flower before the blessed ones who have not yet appeared there, before those who are still to appear there, before those who are now appearing, and before those who are disappearing. We do so, likewise, in all the universes located in the south, west, north, nadir, and zenith, as well as in the intermediate directions—we toss this flower before all the blessed buddhas who are present there, or who will appear there. Blessed One, may each and every being who sees this hand-like utpala also experience its fragrance. May each and every one of them be certain to awaken to unsurpassable, true, and perfect buddhahood. May they also journey throughout all buddha realms.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-134}} Then, as they tossed the hand-like utpala, the Blessed One touched the flower with his right hand. As soon as he touched it a half-sized body of the Thus-Gone One appeared within the utpala. Moreover, within each of the utpalas {{note:{index:13,id:UT22084-048-001-135}}} there was again a half-sized version of the Thus-Gone One. All these half-sized bodies of the Thus-Gone One now declared, “The teachers of those who do not know all phenomena to be like an illusion, and who are not inclined to think so; the teachers of those who do not know all phenomena to be stainless and devoid of characteristics, and who are not inclined to think so—the teachers of all those who have no such comprehension are neither thus-gone ones, nor hearers of the thus-gone ones.” Speaking such words, they departed. They also spoke the following verses:
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-136}} “Illusion-like phenomena cannot be grasped, And all that cannot be grasped is like the moon in water. Because they are empty, they do not possess any empty nature. Thus, this intrinsic nature {{page:{number:30,folio:F.16.a}}} has been taught by the victorious ones.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-137}} “Absence of characteristics is the true characteristic of all phenomena. With such a nature, devoid of characteristics, Upon examination all phenomena are empty and devoid of self. They cannot be grasped, nor serve as grounds for dispute.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-138}} “Whenever beings wish for this intrinsic nature Their wish occurs by the blessings Of the victorious teachers of great power, And their activities throughout the worlds in the ten directions.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-139}} After the Thus-Gone One’s emanations had proclaimed these verses, they moved ahead, into the ten directions.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-141}} Now the bodhisattva great being Jālinīprabha said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, those noble sons are perfectly trained in aspiration. Any sentient being who hears their prayers, or pronounces their names, will be entirely freed from the experience of numerous pains, and they will become destined for unsurpassable and perfect awakening. What a wonder this is! But, Blessed One, such blessed ones and such noble sons are not suited for this universe. Why not?
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-142}} “Blessed One, as an analogy, a man or woman may have heard of the fame of a priceless and flawless jewel, a jewel that can deliver all possible benefit and happiness. That person may then wish to search for the jewel, and he or she may also have learned the specific characteristics of that precious jewel. Now, imagine that this man or woman sees that immaculate jewel in the middle of the dirt in a latrine pit, or some other filthy place. Around that spot there are some bamboo cane workers, untouchables, outcastes, {{page:{number:31,folio:F.16.b}}} or some other hard-laboring people of low caste. Those people have never heard of that jewel, so they obviously do not know about its qualities either—it would be out of the question. Now, the first person who sees the jewel in the filth may remark that the place where that precious jewel is kept is not a very beautiful one. But the others will just respond, ‘Which precious jewel do you have such praise for?’ Even though the first person may explain about and even point to the jewel, the ignorant people will not understand. They will say, ‘Hey you, why are you talking about the qualities of a precious jewel? That “precious jewel” does not have any good qualities. You are a liar and a trickster. We do not believe anything you say.’ The first person may then extract the jewel and lift it out from the dirt. As soon as the jewel emerges the poor people will become extremely upset at each other, and from then on they will be surrounded by numerous harms.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-143}} “Blessed One, we are here in the world of Enduring, a place where poor beings of lesser roots of virtue are born. Blessed One, the way we perceive you within this world is similar to the way the person of learning in the analogy sees and recognizes the precious jewel in the midst of the filth. Blessed One, we see the blessed thus-gone ones and the bodhisattva great beings who don the inconceivable armor to be like perfect and completely pure jewels, capable of granting all manner of happiness. {{page:{number:32,folio:F.17.a}}} Yet, Blessed One, other beings within this world regard them in a way that is similar to the way the poor and lowly people of the area look at the precious jewel.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-144}} “Blessed One, in the analogy a person heard about the jewel’s qualities and decided to search for it. When seeing the jewel in a pit of filth, he or she remarked that the jewel was not kept in a proper place. Similarly, Blessed One, the blessed buddhas and the bodhisattvas present throughout the ten directions also remark that the Blessed One’s buddha realm is not befitting to him. In this way they praise the blessed Buddha and all the bodhisattva great beings who bear the inconceivable armor.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-145}} “In the analogy, Blessed One, a man or woman heard about the qualities of a precious jewel, decided to go searching for it, found the jewel stuck in filth, and subsequently declared that the jewel was not being kept properly. We, similarly, have heard praises of the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha as well as of the bodhisattva great beings who have donned the inconceivable armor. Hence we journeyed here to behold them. But being here, Blessed One, we see that this universe is plagued by hundreds of shortcomings and that sentient beings here possess inferior roots of virtue. {{page:{number:33,folio:F.17.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-146}} “Blessed One, the precious jewel in the mud does not lose its brilliance and, just as in that analogy, the thus-gone ones in the ten directions and the bodhisattva great beings who don the inconceivable armor do not lose their radiance either. However, because the intentions and aspirations of beings here are of an inferior quality, the Blessed One has caused his luster to extend for a distance of no more than one fathom.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-147}} “In the analogy, Blessed One, the poor people do not believe what they hear about the qualities of the jewel. Likewise, beings in this universe do not believe in the Thus-Gone One’s extreme brilliance, his vast aspirations, his emanations, and his qualities of awakening. Needless it is, then, to state that they do not have faith in the bodhisattva great beings either.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-148}} “Blessed One, when the person in the analogy takes out the precious jewel from the dirt, that immediately causes the others there to experience great harm. Similarly, when the Thus-Gone One passes completely beyond suffering and the bodhisattva great beings depart for other world realms it causes bodhisattvas who retain sūtras and who pursue true retention to become extremely disturbed with one another. ‘The Dharma is no longer heard; only non-Dharma can be heard here.’ And why is that? Because under such circumstances those who live here would fall into non-Dharma and pursue non-Dharmic means of livelihood. They would struggle with, defame, criticize, {{page:{number:34,folio:F.18.a}}} and disparage one another. They would cause each other to lose their virtuous qualities, and thus experience suffering. They would no longer apply themselves to Dharma and virtue.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-149}} “Blessed One, no noble son or daughter in pursuit of the meaningful, committed to the pursuit of meaning, and committed to the accomplishment of a buddha’s awakening would in that case take birth in this world. As not even followers of the Hearer Vehicle would appear, what need is there to mention those who adhere to the Bodhisattva Vehicle? Why do I say so, Blessed One? Well, the beings who live in the great hell realms, such as Incessant Pain, Revival, Heat , and Intense Heat, do not experience happiness for even one moment, for even a mere instant. Blessed One, from the perspective of the bodhisattvas in Single Parasol —the realm of the blessed thus-gone one Single Jewel Ornament—the bodhisattva great beings who are born in this Enduring world are comparable to the beings born in the Hell of Incessant Pain, because they do not perceive them to experience any happiness at all.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-150}} “In a buddha realm of sheer and supreme happiness sentient beings are naturally blissful. But, Blessed One, the beings who are born in this universe find it hard to believe what I say. Nevertheless, Blessed One, I have come here to clear my doubts about the Dharma and to listen to the gateway of the Dharma seal. Blessed One, we seek teaching from you. And why? Because, Blessed One, {{page:{number:35,folio:F.18.b}}} all pleasure and pain is impermanent. From the Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the perfect Buddha we wish to hear a Dharma in which there is no happiness, no suffering, no permanence, no impermanence, no thought, no conception, no entity, no absence of entity, nothing conditioned, nothing unconditioned, nothing imputed, nothing not imputed, nothing mundane, nothing beyond the world, nothing defiled, nothing undefiled, no truth, no falsity, no awakening, no branches of awakening, no powers, no light, no darkness, no consciousness, no absence of consciousness, no fruition, no lack of fruition, no path, no absence of path, no beginning, no completion, no world, and no liberation from the world. And why is that so? Because, Blessed One, the world should be taught about the happiness that arises from the accumulation of merit and from making resolutions, and all other such things. Blessed One, the qualities of buddhahood cannot be taught. That is to say, in buddhahood there are no powers, no fearlessnesses, no miracles, {{page:{number:36,folio:F.19.a}}} no miraculous displays, no advice, no miraculous advice, no teaching, and no miraculous teaching. There are no fearlessnesses nor powers, and there is neither happiness nor suffering. Because all that is thought, all that is conceptual movement.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-151}} “Blessed One, whether someone qualifies for the title of ‘thus-gone one’ is not to be decided in terms of whether or not suchness has been attained. All that is conceptual movement, thought, straying, and construction. Truth and falsity, the conditioned and the unconditioned, the defiled and the undefiled, negativity and lack of negativity, the mundane and the supramundane, being disciplined and having flawed discipline, having powers and not having powers, being fearless and not being fearless, being worthy of donations and not being worthy of donations, being a thus-gone one, being a buddha, being a bodhisattva, being a hearer, being a solitary buddha, as well as prayers, and blessings—all such thinking is completely crushed by the thus-gone ones and the path is comprehended completely. That is why the thus-gone ones are undaunted like lions. That is why they trumpet like elephants. When they make their assertions, the thus-gone ones let there be disagreement where there is disagreement and agreement where there is agreement. The thus-gone ones make their assertions {{page:{number:37,folio:F.19.b}}} with mindfulness and wisdom, and with both dwell in equanimity.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-152}} “The states of the blessed thus-gone ones are states of awakening and states that are self-arisen. Since they are not even shared by hearers or solitary buddhas, they are of course not common to other lowly beings. And why, Blessed One, are they not shared with others? Because all other lowly beings cannot achieve states that are of that quality, or that are so comprehensive, or that are of the same duration, or with the same application, or that involve such bliss. Blessed One, without the thus-gone ones, no sentient being can achieve such states. Blessed One, such states are not accessible to any other being. Blessed One, states of this kind are not accessible to any hearer or solitary buddha. Blessed One, ‘not accessible’ here means that they are not effectuated or experienced. Hence they are inaccessible. And why is this so? Because such states surpass the experience of hearers and solitary buddhas. And why is that the case? Because, Blessed One, such states are infinite. And why, Blessed One, are such states infinite? Because, Blessed One, the wishes of the thus-gone ones are infinite; they cannot be matched by anything at all. And why is this so? Because, Blessed One, such states are beyond language. Being ‘beyond language’ is to be inexpressible, and {{page:{number:38,folio:F.20.a}}} language is nothing but expression. Therefore, Blessed One, these states are self-arisen.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-153}} “Blessed One, beings who do not observe such states and do not understand them must go through death and transfer to other world realms. Beings who do not comprehend such states come to suffer great harm.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-154}} “Blessed One, the state of the thus-gone ones is the ultimate gateway, the gateway of the Dharma. It contains sixty-eight thousand subsidiary gateways. The awakening of the thus-gone Single Jewel Ornament is limitless like space and the bodhisattva great beings gain accomplishment through the extent of the very same gateway.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-156}} When this gateway teaching was delivered and explained, seventy-seven thousand bodhisattva great beings attained the gateway of the stainless Dharma, which is the very state of the thus-gone ones. They all thus declared, “Today we have attained awakening! Today we have attained awakening!”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-157}} Furthermore, one quadrillion beings set their minds on unexcelled and perfect awakening, and because of their initial generation of the mind of awakening the Blessed One prophesied their attainment of unexcelled and perfect awakening. Likewise, eight sextillion beings attained the stainless and immaculate Dharma eye that sees phenomena, and three thousand monks liberated their minds from defilement with no further perpetuation.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-158}} At this point the Blessed One smiled, and as soon as he did so a magnificent light shone forth in the world and the great earth shook. The venerable Ānanda {{page:{number:39,folio:F.20.b}}} now draped his Dharma robe over one shoulder and knelt on his right knee. Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and inquired, “When the Blessed One smiled, a magnificent light shone in the world and the great earth shook. What were the causes and conditions for this to happen?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-159}} “Ānanda,” the Blessed One replied, “when the bodhisattva Jālinīprabha taught and explained this gateway of the Dharma, seventy-seven thousand bodhisattvas attained the gateway of the stainless Dharma seal. Ānanda, the bodhisattva Jālinīprabha has obtained this teaching of the Dharma seal from eight thousand buddhas at locations throughout the expanse of space. Having thus obtained this stainless Dharma gateway, he has gained deliverance by means of it, and so he has become skilled in journeying from buddha realm to buddha realm.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-160}} At that time, beyond seventy-eight innumerable buddha realms to the west, there was a world known as Single Heap of Jewels. Within that universe resided a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha known as Infinite Jewel Leader. Abiding and remaining present there, he taught the Dharma to a retinue of many hundreds of thousands. Present in that gathering was also the regent of the blessed one Infinite Jewel Leader, the bodhisattva great being Purposeful Compelling Leader.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-161}} Hearing a clear voice, and perceiving the light from the thus-gone Śākyamuni, the bodhisattva great being Purposeful Compelling Leader asked the thus-gone Infinite Jewel Leader, “Blessed One, whose is this clear voice, and whose is this radiance?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-162}} Then the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect {{page:{number:40,folio:F.21.a}}} buddha Infinite Jewel Leader said to the bodhisattva great being Purposeful Compelling Leader, “Purposeful Compelling Leader, to the west, beyond seventy-eight innumerable universes, there is a world known as Enduring. Within that universe resides a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha known as Śākyamuni. Abiding and remaining present there, he is now teaching a gathering headed by incomparable bodhisattvas. He is delivering a Dharma teaching belonging to the Bodhisattva Collection that satisfies all beings and is known as ‘Cutting through the Doubts of All Beings.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-163}} At this point the bodhisattva great being Purposeful Compelling Leader said to the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Infinite Jewel Leader, “Blessed One, I wish to go to the world known as Enduring, so that I may see, venerate, and serve the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni, and so that I may see those incomparable bodhisattvas.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-164}} “Noble son,” replied the blessed thus-gone Infinite Jewel Leader, “if you know that the time has come, then go. But act with mindfulness as you remain in that buddha realm. Why do I say that? Because, Purposeful Compelling Leader, the bodhisattva great beings born in that world are hard to approach. {{page:{number:41,folio:F.21.b}}} When you arrive, ask on my behalf whether the Blessed One has encountered but little hardship and discomfort, and whether he remains healthy, strong, and at ease. You must also offer this hand-like lotus flower to the Thus-Gone One.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-165}} The bodhisattva great being Purposeful Compelling Leader then rose from his seat, and bowed his head to the feet of that blessed one. After he had also circumambulated that blessed one, he left for the world of Enduring, accompanied by seventy-eight thousand other bodhisattvas. As soon as they arrived, all the flowering trees and fruit trees in Enduring bore flowers and fruits regardless of the season. A rain of flowers and scented water fell from the sky, and numerous musical sounds could be heard. The bodhisattva great being Purposeful Compelling Leader proceeded to the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha. Arriving there, he bowed his head to the feet of the Blessed One. Holding on to the Blessed One’s feet with both hands, and touching them to his head, he said, “Blessed One, the bodhisattva Purposeful Compelling Leader bows his head to your feet in homage.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-166}} “Purposeful Compelling Leader,” replied the Blessed One, “you have offered your respect, worship, and veneration.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-167}} Then the bodhisattva great being Purposeful Compelling Leader stood up {{page:{number:42,folio:F.22.a}}} and, standing before the Blessed One, he said, “The blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Infinite Jewel Leader inquires whether the Blessed One may have encountered but little hardship and discomfort, and whether he remains healthy, strong, and at ease. Blessed One, he also sends you a hand-like lotus flower, requesting that out of your great love you accept it from the bodhisattva Purposeful Compelling Leader.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-168}} Having in this way received the hand-like lotus flower from the bodhisattva, the Blessed One inquired, “Purposeful Compelling Leader, has the blessed thus-gone Infinite Jewel Leader encountered but little hardship and discomfort, and does he remain unchanged?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-169}} “Blessed One,” replied Purposeful Compelling Leader, “the blessed thus-gone Infinite Jewel Leader has encountered but little hardship. He is strong and remains unchanged, happily enjoying his buddha realm.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-170}} Then the Blessed One gave the hand-like lotus flower to the bodhisattva great being Ajita. Holding up the lotus, the bodhisattva great being Ajita offered the following prayer:
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-171}} “Blessed One, by this root of virtue, may the buddha realms of all noble sons and daughters who set their minds on unexcelled and perfect awakening be perfectly pure, and may sentient beings gain maturity. Why do I express this prayer? Because, Blessed One, {{page:{number:43,folio:F.22.b}}} it is hard to teach the Dharma to beings who are not mature, who have not engendered roots of virtue, who possess lesser roots of virtue, or who are inspired by what is inferior.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-172}} “And what is here the objective? The objective is, Blessed One, for this hand-like lotus flower to enable beings to perceive whichever realm of the world they may wish. The objective is for the flower to enable the perception of the world known as Heap of Jewels , the buddha realm of the blessed thus-gone Infinite Jewel Leader. It is to enable the perception of the bodhisattvas of that world, who have truly entered their vehicle, as well as the perception of the perfect hearers there, who for the most part are endowed with the threefold or sixfold knowledge.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-173}} “In that blessed thus-gone one’s buddha realm the lotus flowers are produced through a great ripening of karma. Hence, Blessed One, I dedicate this root of virtue so that bodhisattvas may be free from obscuration with regard to any phenomenon. Blessed One, I dedicate this root of virtue so that those bodhisattvas who have not yet engendered the mind of unexcelled and perfect awakening may do so. I dedicate this root of virtue toward the thus-gone ones’ perfect awakening to the suchness of all phenomena and their perfect awakening to the suchness that is free from disturbance.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-175}} Then the Blessed One asked Bhadrapāla, “Bhadrapāla, do you understand what Maitreya {{note:{index:14,id:UT22084-048-001-176}}} has said? What are the phenomena to which the thus-gone ones perfectly awaken?” {{page:{number:44,folio:F.23.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-177}} “Blessed One,” replied Bhadrapāla, “there are no phenomena that pertain to the thus-gone ones’ perfect awakening to suchness and their perfect awakening to freedom from disturbance. Blessed One, the thus-gone ones do not apprehend any such phenomena, since there are no such phenomena, nor is there an absence of such phenomena. Blessed One, if such a phenomenon was apprehended, it would only be the apprehending of the perception of the phenomenon by the thus-gone ones; but the thus-gone ones do not apprehend any such perception. Why is that? Because, Blessed One, there are no perceptions at all. Since the thus-gone ones do not even apprehend themselves, it goes without saying that they do not apprehend any perception, let alone having any authentic engagement in the perception of phenomena as phenomena.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-178}} “Blessed One, the Blessed One has not said that any phenomena at all are grasped, nor that they are relinquished, nor that they are transcended, nor that they are attained, by those phenomena being perceived as they are and because they are so. What, then, does this mean? Blessed One, if the thus-gone ones were to seek phenomena, where would they seek them? Those phenomena are suchness, and within suchness there is no thus-gone one. Moreover, the thus-gone ones are suchness; they are thus-gone ones by virtue of suchness. For the thus-gone ones there are no marks; they are thus-gone ones by virtue of the absence of marks. The thus-gone ones are free of marks; they are thus-gone ones by virtue of freedom from marks. The thus-gone ones know minds; they are thus-gone ones by virtue of knowing minds. {{page:{number:45,folio:F.23.b}}} The thus-gone ones are free from disturbance. They are thus-gone ones by virtue of freedom from disturbance. Moreover, all phenomena are just like the thus-gone ones. They are thus-gone ones by virtue of being just like them.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-179}} “In this way, Blessed One, all phenomena are thus-gone ones. That is why, Blessed One, the thus-gone ones remain within the lotuses, and just as they remain within the lotuses, so likewise they remain in the state of a thus-gone, and in the state of awakening. Those who neither grasp nor apprehend that in which they remain in that way are to be classified as worthy recipients of offerings in this world.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-180}} “Bhadrapāla,” asked the Blessed One, “where do you remain as you speak these words?”
“Blessed One,” replied Bhadrapāla, “I remain exactly where the world remains, and I speak these words from there. However, this is not the way childish beings grasp it. How, then, do childish beings grasp? They grasp disturbance, and because they grasp disturbance, they are disturbed, and very disturbed. Blessed One, the world does not remain. In what sense does it not remain? In the sense that an illusion does not remain. Yet childish beings argue, saying, ‘My place, that is the world.’ However, this is not the realm of childish beings. The world does not remain within that which is an optical illusion, nor does it remain within that which is impermanent. Yet this frightens childish beings. The world does not remain within that which is a hallucination, and this is not any different from noble beings. {{note:{index:15,id:UT22084-048-001-182}}} {{page:{number:46,folio:F.24.a}}} The world does not remain within the repulsive, yet childish beings are motivated by karma. Here, Blessed One, where the world remains, there is no occasion for any of the disturbance of the world. Hence, Blessed One, the place where I remain is here alone, where the world remains.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-183}} The Blessed One now asked the bodhisattva Bhadrapāla, “Bhadrapāla, do you say this through truly seeing phenomena?”
“Blessed One,” replied Bhadrapāla, “whatever is a phenomenon is only not what the Blessed One has perfectly awoken to.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-185}} The Blessed One then inquired of the bodhisattva great being, Bhadrapāla, “Bhadrapāla, have I not perfectly awoken to all phenomena?”
“Blessed One, have you perfectly awoken to all phenomena?” answered Bhadrapāla. “Blessed One, that to which which you have perfectly awoken, is that phenomena, or is it not phenomena?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-187}} “Well said, Bhadrapāla,” replied the Blessed One, “well said. That which the thus-gone ones fully awake to is neither phenomena, nor is it an absence of phenomena. Bhadrapāla, my wisdom does not move somewhere, and my eyes do not engage something. There is no cognition of beings, nor any engagement of the mind. No appearance is cognized, yet neither is any exclusion cognized or apprehended. That is because this is neither affliction, nor purification.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-188}} “However, Bhadrapāla, even if I explain to sentient beings about the notion of the experience of no characteristics, and the phenomena of the experience of no characteristics, {{page:{number:47,folio:F.24.b}}} they become bewildered. Bhadrapāla, apart from thus-gone ones and bodhisattva great beings in their final existence, you will not be able to find or observe anyone who can accept this. Bhadrapāla, even when bodhisattva great beings who are in their final existence, held back by just that single birth, hear this Dharma it still frightens them. So what need is there to mention the case of lowly sentient beings? It is impossible for them to comprehend this Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-189}} “Bhadrapāla, there will come a time when all monks and nuns and all male and female lay practitioners are physically and mentally untrained, and lack training in discipline and insight. Bhadrapāla, when such persons hear the teaching of the Dharma treasure and the treasure of the thus-gone one, in which the awakening of the thus-gone ones, being beyond thought, affliction, and perception, is not accessed, they will be frightened, scared, and afraid. And thus they will fall into the abyss. {{note:{index:16,id:UT22084-048-001-190}}} The reason for this is that, while it is taught that ‘the thus-gone ones have perfectly awakened to all phenomena,’ there is also the teaching that, ‘my wisdom, eyes, and mind do not have any access to it.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-191}} “Therefore, such monks who teach the sūtras will develop the wish to harm, hurt, kill, and cause unrest. Bhadrapāla, at that time, those who rise up against me in this way will be in control.

Such fools do not understand the Thus-Gone One as he now lets his lion’s roar be heard within the circle of disciples, and they do not understand the intrinsic nature of the Thus-Gone One. Consider how, lacking knowledge and vision, they will fail to recognize that which is a praise to me, and instead take something that actually is no praise to be just that.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-193}} “Bhadrapāla, you may wonder what that which is no praise entails. Bhadrapāla, any teaching concerned with grasping at something is no praise to me. That is why I say that at that time those people will defame me, rise against me, and undermine virtuous mendicants. Mendicants of that kind are corrupted and putrid, like rotting trees. Their way of looking at things is that of an extremist, a dualist, an adherent to permanence and annihilation. Theirs is the way of the arrogant Dharma teachers who suffer from Dharma conceit, of those involved in mental construction, of those involved in the formation of notions, of those fond of materialism, of those partaking in saṃsāra, and of those who turn their backs on the path of the true view.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-194}} “At that time such persons will develop the notion of the ultimate; adhere to the sacrificial fire ritual, becoming unbraided; profess to objects, and profess to agents. However, Bhadrapāla, if they possess the proper absorption, they will also realize awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-195}} “Bhadrapāla, when I have passed into nirvāṇa, such people will perceive flaws in terms of object and agent, and thus regress. When they then go forth in my teachings they will make that Dharma fade away. {{page:{number:49,folio:F.25.b}}}

By means of a mundane view they engage with my objects and agents and teach but little in terms of the wisdom of the buddhas. I say that what such people teach is no praise to me and is not emancipation. And why not? Because, Bhadrapāla, such people make use of an impure and insignificant fire that discards the awakening accomplished through millions of incalculable eons. Bhadrapāla, such people defame the Thus-Gone One and rise up against him.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-199}} “Bhadrapāla, you may then wonder what it is to praise the Thus-Gone One and proclaim his words. Bhadrapāla, those who do so do not grasp, construct, or develop karmic formations with respect to any phenomenon. They do not pursue the three times, but are beyond statements and beyond abandonment. Such people, Bhadrapāla, utter praise to the Thus-Gone One, and they do not impute. Those are the offspring of the buddhas, the children of their minds. They are born from the Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-200}} “Bhadrapāla, teachers and upholders of such sūtras proclaim the words of the Thus-Gone One.

Those are my children, the children of my heart, the children of my voice. {{page:{number:50,folio:F.26.a}}} They are blessed by me and appointed by me. I have brought them true delight and they have established the shrine of the Dharma. They have beaten the drum of the Dharma and blown the Dharma conch. They have raised high the Dharma’s victory banner. Inspired by the blessed buddhas such beings have accumulated proper activities. They adhere to the garland of the excellent qualities and are appointed as their guardians. They defeat adversaries and are like flowers in the world. Encountering such beings is extremely rare. Their vision is pure and they are vessels of awakening. The bodhisattvas bring them joy. The thus-gone ones bring them joy. They have opened their vision of the Dharma and are not obscured with respect to any phenomenon. They rightly please the thus-gone ones and repay their kindness. Adorned with the ornaments of the Dharma, they are saturated with wisdom. Letting the rain of Dharma fall, they satisfy the heart children of the victorious ones. Causing the qualities of buddhahood to increase, they display the foliage of excellent qualities. Blossoming with the flowers of the branches of awakening, they produce the fruits of freedom from desirous attachment. Residing on the seat of awakening, they attain unexcelled and perfect awakening. {{page:{number:51,folio:F.26.b}}} They are the guides who show the path; they are immersed in Dharma generosity. In short, Bhadrapāla, even if all the thus-gone ones explain the qualities of such noble children, people will find it hard to trust. Bhadrapāla, such beings are the ones who proclaim my praises.

We bear it for the sake of disengaging from the aggregates—not for the sake of observing them. {{page:{number:58,folio:F.30.a}}} We bear it for the sake of disengaging from the elements—not for the sake of observing them. We bear it for the sake of disengaging from the sense sources—not for the sake of observing them. Such is the armor of disengagement that we bear.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-221}} “Blessed One, this is an armor of disengagement. It is not an armor and does not bring the results of an armor. Hence, it is not worn for the sake of obtaining anything at all. Neither is it worn for the sake of giving up anything. We do not think of it as an armor, or assert it to be so. We do not assert it to be in any particular way, as having any particular extent, or as having any particular purpose. Such is the armor that we bear.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-222}} “Blessed One, if we were to assert the armor in any way, we would also perpetuate the self. But, Blessed One, we do not perpetuate the self. We do not perpetuate it; bodhisattvas do not apprehend there being or not being a self. Blessed One, if there is abiding on there not being a self, that implies nothing but abiding on the existence of a self. This is because, Blessed One, all phenomena are beyond abiding. Blessed One, this is how we train with our armor in the world. That is to say, this is not a training in anything at all.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-223}} The bodhisattva great being Bhadrapāla then spoke as follows to the Blessed One: “Blessed One, I do not perceive the qualities of ordinary persons to be ‘far away,’ nor do I perceive the qualities of the buddhas to be ‘nearby.’ I do not perceive the qualities of training to be ‘distant,’ {{page:{number:59,folio:F.30.b}}} nor do I perceive the qualities of the buddhas to be ‘close.’ I do not perceive such a thing as ‘the qualities of buddhahood,’ nor do I perceive in terms of anything being ‘in accord with the qualities of buddhahood.’ Blessed One, I neither perceive any benefits, nor do I perceive any flaws. Such is the armor that I have donned. Such is the armor that I bear in the world.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-224}} Bhadrapāla and the others among the five hundred bodhisattvas who had tossed the lotus flower before the Blessed One then journeyed out into the worlds of the ten directions. They let a rain fall on the blessed buddhas, and they brought sentient beings to maturation.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-226}} At that time there was in the east, beyond countless and innumerable universes, a universe known as Marks of Royal Splendor, and within that universe resided a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha called Roar of Signlessness. Abiding and remaining present there, he taught the Dharma. This blessed one had prophesied that following himself the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin would awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-227}} Now, having seen the great light and heard the special sound, the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin addressed the blessed thus-gone Roar of Signlessness: “Blessed One, from whence comes this special sound, and what is the source of this great illumination?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-228}} “Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin,” replied the Blessed One to the bodhisattva great being, {{page:{number:60,folio:F.31.a}}} “west of this buddha realm, beyond countless and innumerable world realms, there is a universe known as Enduring. Within that universe resides the thus-gone one Śākyamuni. Abiding and remaining present there, he is delivering a Dharma teaching that belongs to the Bodhisattva Collection and is known as ‘Truly Satisfying All Sentient Beings by Eliminating Their Doubts.’ That is the source of the light and the distinctive sound. In that buddha realm have arrived, within the circle of the retinue, infinite and unfathomable bodhisattva great beings who bear the inconceivable armor.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-229}} In response, the bodhisattva said to that blessed one, “Blessed One, I wish to visit that universe so that I may see, venerate, and serve the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni. I also wish to see those bodhisattvas. And why? Because it is hard to even hear about such beings. Needless it is, then, to mention how difficult it is to behold and venerate them.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-230}} The thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Roar of Signlessness then said to the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin, “Noble son, if you know that the time has come, then go. The Thus-Gone One grants you permission.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-231}} The bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin then rose from his seat. He bowed his head to the feet of that blessed one and circumambulated him. Upon his departure, {{page:{number:61,folio:F.31.b}}} the Blessed One then placed a lotus flower in the bodhisattva’s hand and told him, “Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin, you must offer this lotus flower to the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni on my behalf.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-232}} Thus, the bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin came to the world of Enduring with that lotus flower in his hand. Then, from that great lotus flower appeared all the superior beings who had been part of the retinue of the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Roar of Signlessness, when he engaged in bodhisattva activity. Moreover, so that this could be experienced by the sentient beings there, similar such great lotus flowers now spread throughout the universe.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-233}} Holding the lotus flower, the bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin thus came to the universe known as Enduring. At the very moment he arrived there, all the trees, fruits, flowers, and leaves that existed in Enduring—down to the size of just four finger widths—appeared from Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin’s hand. Moreover, in each of their own languages all beings in Enduring began to speak of impermanence, suffering, and the absence of self. They also spoke of the masteries, the powers, the branches of awakening, the concentrations, the liberations , the absorptions, and the attainments.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-234}} Witnessing all this, the venerable Śāradvatī­putra exclaimed, “Ah, how wondrous that the Thus-Gone One, the Foe-Destroyer, the perfect Buddha performs such miracles!” {{page:{number:62,folio:F.32.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-235}} “Śāradvatī­putra,” said the Blessed One, “these miracles are not of the Thus-Gone One. Śāradvatī­putra, these are the miracles of the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin. Śāradvatī­putra, to the east of this buddha realm, beyond innumerable and countless universes, there is a universe known as Marks of Royal Splendor. Within that universe resides the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Roar of Signlessness. From the realm where that buddha abides and remains present the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin has arrived. All this appears due to the ripening of that bodhisattva’s past actions.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-236}} “Blessed One,” asked Śāradvatī­putra, “which numerous roots of virtue did the bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin gather, so that he now, through their ripening, has achieved such mastery?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-237}} “Śāradvatī­putra,” replied the Blessed One, “it is excellent that you thought to ask the Thus-Gone One about this matter. Śāradvatī­putra, such eloquence is exclusively due to the power of the Thus-Gone One. Listen, Śāradvatī­putra, I shall explain this to you. {{page:{number:63,folio:F.32.b}}} When all the blessed buddhas in the past awoke to perfect buddhahood and resided upon the seat of awakening, the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin was the one who initially supplicated them and requested them to teach. This is how he accumulated the virtuous roots for unsurpassable and perfect awakening. As he went before them, he would sometimes become Brahmā and so make requests and supplicate. Other times he would do so in the form of Śakra, universal emperors, kings, or sages.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-238}} “For example, Śāradvatī­putra, when I had first awoken to true and perfect buddhahood, Mahābrahmā invoked and supplicated me, saying, ‘There are beings whose karmic obscurations are minor, who suffer from not having heard the Dharma, and who act in accord with the teachings of the thus-gone ones. Blessed One, please therefore teach the Dharma. Bliss-Gone One, please turn the wheel of Dharma.’ Śāradvatī­putra, the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin has invoked and supplicated all the past buddhas in the same way, requesting them, ‘Please teach the Dharma. Please turn the wheel of Dharma.’ All the roots of virtue that he gathered he has dedicated exclusively to the supplication for the turning of the wheel of Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-239}} “Śāradvatī­putra, let me provide you with an illustration that establishes this point fully. Within this trichiliocosm a billion suns and moons are in movement. Four billion oceans surround the continents, of which there are likewise four billion. {{page:{number:64,folio:F.33.a}}} There are seven billion islands, a billion tall surrounding mountains, and a billion inner circles of mountains. Śāradvatī­putra, now imagine that this trichiliocosm becomes like the ocean, eighty-four thousand leagues deep and wide. Imagine then, Śāradvatī­putra, that the thousandfold universe is filled up with sesame seeds, and that some strong, powerful, and diligent person comes by. This person takes up the sesame seeds by the handful and tosses them in the four directions. As the seeds are carried by the wind, each one of them produces an entire universe. Śāradvatī­putra, what do you think? As they thus appear from each sesame seed, how many universes are there?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-240}} “Blessed One,” replied Śāradvatī­putra, “there are innumerable universes. Blissful One, there are universes beyond count.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-241}} “Śāradvatī­putra,” said the Blessed One, “try to imagine and understand this. Let us say that all these universes that arose from the sesame seeds were to turn into a single city. Imagine that the city reaches as high as it is wide, and that it is surrounded by a solid, stable, unbreakable, and indestructible wall. Śāradvatī­putra, now imagine if that great city became a granary, full of grains. Śāradvatī­putra, what do you think? How large would the heap of grains then be?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-242}} “Blessed One, it would be immeasurable,” replied Śāradvatī­putra. “Blissful One, it could not be fathomed.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-243}} “Śāradvatī­putra,” said the Blessed One, “try to imagine and understand this. {{page:{number:65,folio:F.33.b}}} It is in fact possible that some mathematicians, or master mathematicians, could calculate the extent of such a mass of grains. Yet the amount of thus-gone ones, residing on the seats of awakening, to whom the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin has paid worship, invoked, and supplicated to turn the wheel of Dharma when they first attained perfect buddhahood is indeed beyond count. And there are even many more blessed buddhas for whom he has prepared and offered a Dharma wheel made of the seven precious substances. And again, compared to that amount, there are far more blessed buddhas to whom he has offered a flower wheel or a wheel of incense without having dedicated it to unsurpassable and perfect awakening. Why then even mention the exquisitely adorned wheels of gold, silver, and wood that he has offered to the blessed buddhas? All such offerings to the blessed buddhas he has dedicated toward the turning of the Dharma wheel, and thus he has supplicated, again and again.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-244}} “There was a time when the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Royal Leader Treading with Great Strength appeared in the world. At that time there was a king by the name of Blazing with Famed Power, who reigned as a universal emperor within the trichiliocosm. There, within the retinue of his queens, or residing in his parks, the king would pursue the pleasures of the senses, frolicking and reveling. Yet one time, as he asked his queens to entertain him with song, dance, and music, {{page:{number:66,folio:F.34.a}}} he instead heard the words of impermanence, suffering, and the absence of self. Immediately the king became disenchanted with his pleasures. Having lost his desire, he became frightened and sad, and in such a frame of mind he went before the thus-gone Royal Leader Treading with Great Strength. Having bowed his head to the Thus-Gone One’s feet he took a place before him.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-245}} “Upon the king’s arrival the Blessed One spoke on roots of virtue from the past, and as the king listened, he thought, ‘The Blessed One sees with wisdom free of any obscuration, and he has realized roots of virtue for so long. As for myself, compared to him I am not aware of any virtuous roots. Before so many buddhas I have created roots of virtue, yet they were all polluted by the muck of sense pleasures, politics, and power. Thus I did not recognize them, and I did not dedicate them to awakening. May all the roots of virtue that I now form be dedicated to the welfare of all beings! Throughout all places, realms, and buddha realms, may words be spoken in the languages that beings understand, and may all beings thus come to hear of impermanence, suffering, and the absence of self. In all worlds, may all plants and trees, even the smallest ones, resound with the words of impermanence, suffering, and the absence of self, and may all beings hear those words. May all accumulated roots of virtue {{page:{number:67,folio:F.34.b}}} cause all beings to equally enter the Great Vehicle with a wisdom that is just like that of the thus-gone Royal Leader Treading with Great Strength.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-246}} “With this understanding King Blazing with Famed Power then rose from his seat. Standing before the Blessed One, he said, “Blessed One, all of my possessions throughout my entire realm I offer, without exception, to the buddhas and so forth, so that the noble saṅgha may partake of them.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-247}} “Having made this offering, King Blazing with Famed Power then went forth from his household and became a homeless monk. Moreover, as they heard of the king’s going forth all four divisions of the royal army subsequently also went forth. So did the four billion ladies from the royal harem. Hearing of these goings forth, the townspeople and farmers also went forth. Śāradvatī­putra, in short, there were eight billion people who thus went forth and, as soon as they had done so, they practiced diligently.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-248}} “Thus, as they all fervently pursued virtuous qualities, it did not take them long to acquire the five superknowledges. In that very life and body they all became able to travel by the power of their superknowledges and miraculous abilities. Traveling east in this way they visited as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges and met as many buddhas. Before each of them they prayed, ‘Blessed One, please teach the Dharma. Blissful One, please turn the wheel of Dharma.’ In that same way they also traveled to the south, west, and north, as well as above and below, and in {{page:{number:68,folio:F.35.a}}} all the intermediate directions. In each of those directions they visited as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges and supplicated as many buddhas, ‘Blessed One, please teach the Dharma. Blissful One, please turn the wheel of Dharma.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-249}} “Since then the bodhisattva great being Blazing with Famed Power has never been born in an impure buddha realm, nor has he ever taken birth from a womb. Whenever he visits a buddha realm, all the branches, petals, leaves, trees, and forests within that buddha realm will speak of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and the absence of self. Likewise, in all the worlds that he visits, sentient beings will understand each other’s languages, and they will hear the words of impermanence, suffering, and the absence of self.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-250}} “Thus it was, Śāradvatī­putra, that the universal emperor Blazing with Famed Power once heard the thus-gone Royal Leader Treading with Great Strength teaching on past roots of virtue, and so decided to leave his household to become a homeless monk. Sharing his roots of virtue with all beings, he dedicated them toward unexcelled and perfect awakening. Within that very same body he developed the superknowledges and the power of absorption, and so he journeyed to the east, visiting as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges. Visiting as many blessed buddhas, he stood before them, as they resided upon their sacred seat of awakening, invoking and supplicating them to turn the wheel of Dharma. Indeed, in this way he traveled in all the ten directions. Now, Śāradvatī­putra, you should not think that the universal emperor Blazing with Famed Power {{page:{number:69,folio:F.35.b}}} was someone else. Because, Śāradvatī­putra, he is none other than the bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-252}} The bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin then proceeded to the city of Rājagṛha and to the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana where the Blessed One was residing. Going before him, he bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet and took a place in the gathering. Then he addressed the Blessed One with the following words: “Blessed One, the blessed thus-gone Roar of Signlessness inquires whether you have encountered but little hardship and discomfort, and whether you remain healthy, strong, and at ease. And he also sends you this great lotus flower, which I request you to accept.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-253}} At this point the Blessed One accepted the lotus flower from the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin and then said to him, “Noble son, does the blessed thus-gone Roar of Signlessness remain strong, healthy, unchanged, and happy within his buddha realm?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-254}} “Blessed One,” answered the bodhisattva great being, “the thus-gone Roar of Signlessness remains strong, healthy, unchanged, and happy. And why is that? Because, Blessed One, in that buddha realm {{page:{number:70,folio:F.36.a}}} pure beings assemble, who are endowed with three factors of purity. What are those three factors? Pure roots of virtue as they are dedicated to the truth, pure boundless discipline due to aspirations, and pure boundless view due to dedication by means of special insight that is not fixed on any phenomenon. Blessed One, in that buddha realm there is not a single being who has a corrupted discipline, view, or comportment. Blessed One, in that buddha realm even the terms for such flaws do not exist. Compared to that world, Blessed One, this world known as Enduring is like a prison filled with murderers, where people are constantly killing each other. Come, Blessed One. Come along to that other world.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-255}} In response the Blessed One said to the bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin, “Noble son, why would I go to that world? It is fine to stay in this world, teaching the Dharma to beings here.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-256}} Once more the bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin called on the Blessed One: “Blessed One, come along. Come along to that world. If, Blessed One, you decline to come along I shall pull you there by the power of my own miraculous abilities and the force of my aspirations. I shall take you through space and into that world.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-257}} So that the bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin’s powers would be known, {{page:{number:71,folio:F.36.b}}} and so that sentient beings would engender roots of virtue and become inspired, the Blessed One at this point remained indifferent. Then, as if he had become a potter, or a potter’s apprentice, who is spinning his wheel with a stick so fast that it blurs visual perception, the bodhisattva now transformed the trichiliocosm and lifted it up. As he lifted up the world and shook it, the venerable Śāradvatī­putra cried out to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, the world is moving! Blissful One, the world is moving!”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-258}} In response, the Blessed One spoke in a way that was delightful, gentle, harmonious, pleasant, compelling, courteous, widely agreeable, profound, comprehensive, instructive, and guided by wisdom. Thus he said to the venerable Śāradvatī­putra, “Śāradvatī­putra, in this regard I am powerless,” and he made this known throughout the entire trichiliocosm. Hence, at this point all beings who were attached to, confined to, or dependent on the view of the transitory collection became saddened and weary. All four assemblies saw the thus-gone one, the blessed one, the perfect Buddha, surrounded by bodhisattvas, teaching the Dharma while residing on the Dharma throne like a universal emperor. {{page:{number:72,folio:F.37.a}}} They saw him as Brahmā, the lord of Enduring, seated upon his Brahmā-throne and surrounded by Brahmā deities, teaching the Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-259}} The bodhisattva Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin now also revealed other buddha realms. Then, at this point, the Blessed One performed a miracle, bringing forth a strong swirling wind that caused the buddha realms to touch one another. The worlds became hollow and perforated, so that they fell apart and were destroyed. As the Thus-Gone One performed this miraculous feat, the Brahmās and Mahābrahmās of this world, who had otherwise conceived in terms of views, permanence, and the everlasting, now witnessed the collapse and complete destruction of their Brahmā abodes. It was as if a great mass of water had produced an abundance of bubbles and foam, which a storm then scattered, breaking everything into particles. In this way the Brahmā deities witnessed the loss, demolition, and collapse of their abodes. Seeing all this they despaired, and in despair they all prostrated to and gathered around the Blessed One.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-260}} Then the Blessed One said to Śāradvatī­putra, “Śāradvatī­putra, I have explained this before, and I shall now do so again. Ah, Śāradvatī­putra, this worldly existence is defiled and polluted. Ah, Śāradvatī­putra, this world is futile and like an illusion, and hence it is like a water bubble {{page:{number:73,folio:F.37.b}}} that cannot be grasped. Ah, Śāradvatī­putra, this worldly existence is falsely conceived, and hence it is like a magic trick. Ah, Śāradvatī­putra, this worldly existence is discerned by the swift thoughts in space, and hence it is like a mirage. Ah, Śāradvatī­putra, this worldly existence contains nothing solid to be grasped, and hence it is like a hallucination. Ah, Śāradvatī­putra, this worldly existence is conjured up by the actions of thought in space, and hence it is like an echo. Śāradvatī­putra, this worldly existence is false and, by realizing that, the Thus-Gone One has attained perfect buddhahood. Ah, Śāradvatī­putra, this worldly existence is fake, and so, by not being attached to this world, the Thus-Gone One has attained perfect buddhahood.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-261}} “Śāradvatī­putra, I have exact knowledge that this worldly existence has no experience to savor, and many shortcomings up to having no emancipation. In this way I have full knowledge of how to awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. I have exact knowledge of this world, Śāradvatī­putra, just as I have clear knowledge of its origin and the path that leads to its cessation. At this moment, Śāradvatī­putra, I possess clear knowledge of how to awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-262}} “Śāradvatī­putra, you may wonder what the world is. Śāradvatī­putra, the so-called world is the five aggregates. What are those five? They are the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness. Śāradvatī­putra, you may then wonder what is understood by the aggregate of form. Śāradvatī­putra, the Thus-Gone One {{page:{number:74,folio:F.38.a}}} has relinquished the aggregate of form in all its past, future, and present manifestations. However, while I have relinquished the aggregate of form in all its past, future, and present manifestations, it would be wrong to say that the sentient beings in the past, future, and present are not the aggregate of form. Śāradvatī­putra, whether inner or outer, large or small, good or bad, distant or close, the Thus-Gone One teaches that all the aggregate of form, as contained within the three times, is devoid of characteristics. As an analogy, just as the aggregate of space possesses the features of wind, water, fire, and earth, the same can be said with respect to the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-263}} “You may wonder, Śāradvatī­putra, why it is referred to as the aggregate of form . Śāradvatī­putra, childish, ordinary beings are in darkness. They do not recognize the full extent and nature of the characteristics of form as found in the body. Thus, they think instead, ‘I am form’ or ‘Form is me.’ Thus, they cognize and structure things in terms of ‘I.’ This produces arrogance and, in turn, craving for things. Yet, Śāradvatī­putra, when the nature of things is known, that is not the case.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-264}} “Childish, ordinary beings do not comprehend that neither the eye nor form is an entity. Instead, their thoughts are based on holding on to entities that do not exist as such. Childish beings who think in this way thus engage with entities and so take birth within flawed realms. Those who thus experience nonentities, {{page:{number:75,folio:F.38.b}}} the colorless, that which has no color, are indeed greatly bewildered. Such bewildered beings pursue agriculture, and engage in the use of all sorts of weapons. The factor that conditions them is delusion.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-265}} “Due to the sameness of things, the Thus-Gone One has a view of sameness. Having thus gained awakening he has formulated the true view. Because that view is equality, it is referred to as the true view . It is called the true view because it is adhered to by those who are truly diligent and truly liberated. Śāradvatī­putra, the true view that I declare cannot be taught through language. Its teaching is hard to bear. Practice it, Śāradvatī­putra. If you do, you will also be free of darkness.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-266}} “Śāradvatī­putra, this section of the Dharma is said to be accompanied by eighty-four thousand Dharma teachings. This is the gateway to all conditioned and unconditioned phenomena, and it is the way of all phenomena.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-267}} When the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha delivered this teaching of the Dharma, seven hundred and seventy billion beings gained the stainless and immaculate Dharma eye that sees all phenomena. Within the desire realm a billion gods attained this, as did innumerable human beings. Among the billions of such humans who lived on Jambudvīpa, those who were bodhisattvas also gained acceptance that phenomena are unborn. Innumerably many beings {{page:{number:76,folio:F.39.a}}} set their minds on unexcelled and perfect awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-268}} Then the Blessed One withdrew his miraculous activity, and thus the four assemblies, the Brahmā assembly, the assembly of the gods of the desire realm, as well as the other gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas all saw the world as it is.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-269}} At this point the venerable Mahā­maudgalyā­yana rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and said, “Blessed One, the bodhisattva great being Saha­cittotpāda­dharma­cakra­pravartin’s mastery of supernatural powers is amazing. Blessed One, he took this world, including the Blessed One himself, and hurled it into another world. At that time I was unable to identify the characteristics and I could not even remember the names of any supernatural powers, so, needless to mention, I was unable to muster any such powers . Ah, Blessed One, I find it truly amazing that this bodhisattva possesses such supernatural powers. Blessed One, when I carefully scan the changing times I do not recognize even a moment or an instant of such hauling and transportation being performed by any of us. {{note:{index:18,id:UT22084-048-001-270}}} If even a bodhisattva can possess such supernatural powers, then what to say of the powers of the thus-gone ones?” {{page:{number:77,folio:F.39.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-271}} “Maudgalyāyana,” replied the Blessed One, “you should not think that this world was hauled or that the Thus-Gone One was transported. Maudgalyāyana, I do not perceive any mendicant, priest, hearer, or solitary buddha, nor anyone from among the gods up to and including the mahoragas either, who is capable of moving even a fold in the Thus-Gone One’s Dharma robe. What then to say about actually lifting up the Thus-Gone One? That is clearly impossible. For the time being, Maudgalyāyana, set aside the world with its gods, and imagine instead, Maudgalyāyana, the following scenario. Within the trichiliocosm there are beings with form just as there are formless beings. There are beings involved in perception, beings not involved in perception, and beings neither involved nor not involved in perception. Imagine now that they all achieve a human body, and with that human body they go forth. Having gone forth, they also achieve the state of a worthy one and they gain the six superknowledges.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-272}} Maudgalyāyana, to illustrate this, imagine that they gain just as great miraculous abilities as the ones you possess. Maudgalyāyana, what do you think? Will that gathering of beings with miraculous abilities then have increased?”
“Yes, it will, Blessed One,” replied Maudgalyāyana.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-274}} “Maudgalyāyana, these hearers may lift up a thousandfold universe, or millionfold universe, or a trichiliocosm, and transport it beyond as many universes as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges. Yet even those who have attained such perfect supernatural powers will not be able {{page:{number:78,folio:F.40.a}}} to move even a fold in the Thus-Gone One’s Dharma robe as he resides in the midst of space.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-275}} “Maudgalyāyana, let us leave aside such a gathering of beings like you. Imagine instead, Maudgalyāyana, that a being has been born who possesses supernatural powers sufficient for conjuring up a storm that can scatter, pulverize, and destroy any trichiliocosm that has not been blessed by a thus-gone one. Imagine then that with each of the particles that thus emerge from one trichiliocosm he further plunges universes into darkness and destroys as many of them as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges, and that the particles emerging thereby are scattered throughout trichiliocosms. Maudgalyāyana, what do you think? Would such a being have perfected supernatural power?”
“Yes, Blessed One, he would,” answered the venerable Maudgalyāyana.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-277}} “Maudgalyāyana,” continued the Blessed One, “even if this trichiliocosm were full of such beings with perfect supernatural powers—as many as there are plants on a field of sugar cane, reeds, grass, paddy, or sesame—they would still not be able to move even a fold in the Thus-Gone One’s Dharma robe. Needless it is to mention, then, that it would be impossible for them to lift up the Thus-Gone One.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-278}} “Maudgalyāyana, while remaining at this very place, upon this very lion throne, the Thus-Gone One may stir, move, and shake as many innumerable and unfathomable universes in the east as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges. {{page:{number:79,folio:F.40.b}}} Yet the sentient beings there will not think, ‘Our universe is being dislocated and transported!’ Neither will they think, ‘Alas, this universe is subject to destruction and formation!’ Nor will they think, ‘This universe is being scattered and destroyed!’ However, for the sake of taming sentient beings, sometimes forms of the buddhas will teach beings the Dharma beyond marks, but other times forms of hearers, gods, humans, nāgas, boys, or girls will deliver the teaching.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-279}} “Maudgalyāyana, you must trust in all the different Dharma teachings on the buddhas’ powers, fearlessnesses, unique qualities, and preeminent miracles. This is how it is throughout all the ten directions.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-280}} “Maudgalyāyana, to the monk Ānanda I have taught the gateways for the retention of the sūtras, songs, prophecies, parables, past-life stories, elaborate teachings, marvels, narratives, and established teachings. However, Maudgalyāyana, the monk Ānanda is incapable of understanding the domain of the Thus-Gone One. And why is that? Because, Maudgalyāyana, even if they try for an eon, a hundred eons, a thousand eons, or a hundred thousand eons, hearers will not be able to fully understand, conceive of, or comprehend even a single syllable of the Thus-Gone One. What then to say of their understanding of the Thus-Gone One’s full domain?
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-281}} “Maudgalyāyana, the thus-gone ones instruct sentient beings by means of numerous referents, activities, and modes of conduct. {{page:{number:80,folio:F.41.a}}} In this way, they teach the Dharma to sentient beings. However, Maudgalyāyana, although wearing the Thus-Gone One’s Dharma robe accomplishes the aims of all beings and spawns the teaching of the Dharma, none of the hearers fully comprehend this. Maudgalyāyana, if you cannot even accommodate this teaching, then how could you possibly grasp the domain of the Thus-Gone One? That is clearly impossible.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-282}} Having thus accepted the great lotus flower, the Blessed One next posed questions to Bhadrapāla and all the other bodhisattva great beings, who were guardians of the city of Dharma: “Noble sons, can you protect the treasure of the Thus-Gone One’s Dharma? Can you conceal it? Can you comprehend the full domain of the Thus-Gone One? Can you express it? Can you teach it? Can you teach it in full?”
“Blessed One,” they replied, “yes, we can.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-284}} “Noble sons,” continued the Blessed One, “you should therefore consider whichever Dharma teaching you give to be the treasure and domain of the thus-gone ones. Noble sons, all that is expressed with respect to the buddhas’ perfect wisdom, the buddhas’ perfect awakening, the buddhas’ accomplishment of wisdom, and the buddhas’ accomplishment of awakening is the domain of the Thus-Gone One. Thus it must be expressed. Noble sons, wherever an objective referent is seen, it is viewed as the Thus-Gone One’s domain and definitively taught to be so. That Dharma teaching by the Thus-Gone One is delivered by viewing the activities of sentient beings, wherever they are seen, as the Thus-Gone One’s domain. {{page:{number:81,folio:F.41.b}}} Thus, the activities of the Thus-Gone One’s teaching of the Dharma are not displayed for the sake of stopping the activities of sentient beings. {{note:{index:19,id:UT22084-048-001-285}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-286}} “The ninety-nine thousand faculties of the Thus-Gone One’s knowing are as follows: {{note:{index:20,id:UT22084-048-001-287}}} the activities of those engaged in desire, or anger, or delusion; the activities of those engaged in contrived desire, anger, or delusion; the activities of those engaged in desire and anger; the activities of those engaged in contrived desire and anger; the activities of desire and delusion; the activities of those engaged in contrived desire and delusion; the activities of those engaged in anger and delusion; the activities of those engaged in contrived anger and delusion; the faculties for purifying the mind; the faculties for purifying the production of things; the faculties for purifying the production of existence; the faculties that emerge from application; the faculties for purifying activities; the faculties that activate black qualities; the faculties that activate white qualities; the faculties that activate black and white qualities; the faculties that accord with the path; the faculties that accord with tranquility ; the faculties that accord with special insight; the faculties that accord with exhaustion; the faculties that accord with birth; and the faculties that accord with the truth.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-4000}} Maudgalyāyana, in this regard, the twenty thousand faculties related to the accumulation of past conduct motivate actions that are either black, or black and white. {{page:{number:82,folio:F.42.a}}} Such actions produce dark complexion, fair complexion, attractive complexion, unattractive complexion, crippled legs, missing hands or fingers, impaired movement, deafness, blindness, or a missing tongue. The twenty thousand faculties related to the accumulation of past conduct also cause shapes that are long, short, thin, fat, or indistinct. Engaging the faculties of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, the twenty thousand faculties related to the accumulation of past conduct are those associated with desire, anger, delusion, absence of desire, absence of anger, or absence of delusion. The thirty thousand faculties that produce birth activate the time of death. They become apparent when they create changes or signs, such as shaking of the limbs, changes in one’s faculties, bones breaking, or deterioration of the vital signs, which in turn causes loss of one’s luster. These signs finally stop when the voice is choked. Such faculties lead to the realms of hell, animals, or starving spirits. To attain buddhahood one is led to birth among humans, gods, or within different worlds. Or one is led to actualize the exhaustion of defilements. There are seventy-seven thousand faculties that should be considered if one is interested in the features of roots of virtue. There are twenty thousand faculties that lead to roots of nonvirtue and these should be known to facilitate death.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-4001}} The treasure of the thus-gone ones {{page:{number:83,folio:F.42.b}}} is the domain of the thus-gone ones. Dwelling within that domain the Thus-Gone One explains the Dharma without ever tiring or running out of things to say.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-288}} This concludes the second chapter.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-289}} Present in the gathering was a certain Dṛḍhamati­kumāra­bhūta, who now rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and said, “Blessed One, with this gateway of the Dharma I have discovered something very precious. Blessed One, I shall henceforth practice this gateway of the Dharma in order to accomplish the Dharma. How so? From today on, Blessed One, I shall don a suitable armor to pursue and accomplish these Dharma teachings. In the future, in times to come, I shall never let my diligence wane until I have listened to the Dharma treasure of the Thus-Gone One’s domain.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-290}} “Dṛḍhamati,” replied the Thus-Gone One, “this is excellent. It is excellent that throughout innumerable millions of eons you will continue to exert yourself in the pursuit of the practice of my great wisdom. Well done, Dṛḍhamati. Now, Dṛḍhamati, imagine that all at once, in one moment, in one instant, all beings in this trichiliocosm without exception—whether they are those with form, or those who are formless, and whether they are those with perception, or those without perception, {{page:{number:84,folio:F.43.a}}} or those with neither perception nor non-perception—were to attain a human body. Then imagine that a man appears who provides all those beings with enjoyable things. He is able to lift them up and hold them by his hand for an eon or more, faithfully providing them with whatever forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures they might wish for. Meanwhile, he uses his other hand to collect all the feces and urine of all those beings, depositing it all in a different universe. And why does he do that? Because he does not want any of them to experience any unpleasant odor. Dṛḍhamati, what do you think? Does that man render proper service to all those beings, providing them with desirable things?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-291}} “Indeed, Blessed One,” replied Dṛḍhamati, “he serves them with an extremely vast amount of enjoyable things.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-292}} “Dṛḍhamati,” continued the Blessed One, “that man serves each of those beings, providing them with pleasant things.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-4002}} “Now think of a noble son or daughter who, regardless of whether the Thus-Gone One is present or has passed beyond suffering, develops the mind of unexcelled and perfect awakening for the sake of all beings. This person wishes to hear the teachings of the Bodhisattva Collection. He or she is intent on accomplishing the wisdom of the buddhas, the great wisdom, thus eliminating desire, anger, and delusion. So that all beings may go beyond birth, aging, sickness, death, lamentation, suffering, mental pain, {{page:{number:85,folio:F.43.b}}} and disturbance, this person pledges to teach the Dharma to sentient beings. When thus involved in the process of maturing a bodhisattva’s roots of virtue, that person may search for the Dharma and find just one single verse. Dṛḍhamati, as that person provides delightful service to sentient beings, he or she creates merit that is much larger than the former person’s merit. The former merit would not even match one hundredth, or one thousandth of that. In fact, no number, fraction, enumeration, analogy, or comparison would suffice.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-293}} “Dṛḍhamati, the Thus-Gone One is clearly aware of the different ways in which bodhisattva great beings provide delightful service to sentient beings. But who can trust this, Dṛḍhamati, apart from my hearers who have seen the truths, or the bodhisattva great beings with their superior intent?
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-294}} “Dṛḍhamati, bodhisattva great beings feel, ‘We shall be the support of those who have no support, the savior of those who have no savior, the refuge of those who have no refuge, the protector of those who have no protector. We shall accomplish the wisdom of the buddhas, the great wisdom, and lead sentient beings beyond all limits and numbers to the undefiled qualities.’ Such is the armor that they wear.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-295}} “It may then be that in the morning they must provide sentient beings with a heap of jewels as large as Mount Meru, and it may be that they have to do the same at noon, {{page:{number:86,folio:F.44.a}}} and in the afternoon, or throughout the day and night. However, beings may still not be satisfied and the gifts may thus become a circumstance for their depravation. In that case bodhisattvas will think, ‘We shall pursue the Dharma whereby sentient beings will consider the entire trichiliocosm filled with precious substances to be like a glob of spit.’ Needless then to mention what their perception of vile substances will be like.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-296}} “Wise bodhisattva great beings will think, ‘This heap of jewels is the root of desire, anger, and delusion; the root of the sufferings of hell, animals, and hungry spirits; and the root of numerous karmic manifestations.’ Starting out in this way, they attain the mind of transcendence of suffering and have no concern for any heap of jewels. In fact, wise beings do not consider heaps of jewels to be just that. Instead, they see them as heaps of beings in hell, because they understand that anyone who develops attachment to such things will fall into misery.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-297}} “Now, Dṛḍhamati, let us no longer consider just all the beings within a single trichiliocosm. Imagine instead the following. Think of all the universes that extend toward the east, as abundant as the grains of sand in the river Ganges. And then think of all the universes that in the same way extend in each of the ten directions. Within all these universes are beings with bodies, beings without bodies, beings who are involved in perception, beings who are not involved in perception, and beings neither involved {{page:{number:87,folio:F.44.b}}} nor not involved in perception. Think of all that we in this way call ‘the realms of sentient beings.’ Then imagine that, all at once, each one gains a human body. Imagine also that a man appears who always immediately provides them with whatever they might wish for in terms of enjoyable forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures. For an eon or more, that man takes care of all these beings, carrying them on his shoulders and head. Whatever they wish him to do, he does. And, with one hand he sweeps away all these beings’ excrement and urine, disposing of it all in a different universe. Well, Dṛḍhamati, what do you think? Does that man render proper service to those beings, providing them with numerous desirable things?”
“Indeed, Blessed One, he serves them with a vast amount of enjoyable things.” replied Dṛḍhamati.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-299}} “Dṛḍhamati,” continued the Blessed One, “pay attention and understand what I say. That man serves all those beings, providing them with pleasant things. But think now of a noble son or daughter who wishes to provide all beings with refuge, and so sets his or her mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening. This person wishes to listen to the teachings of the Bodhisattva Collection, the teachings whereby bodhisattvas’ roots of virtue ripen into unexcelled and perfect awakening, and may therefore diligently pursue the Dharma of the bodhisattvas. If, Dṛḍhamati, that person takes even just a single step toward the pursuit and diligent practice of the bodhisattva Dharma, then the ensuing roots of virtue {{page:{number:88,folio:F.45.a}}} will not wear out or come to an end before the attainment of unexcelled and perfect awakening. And why? Dṛḍhamati, the former person’s way of providing delightful service cannot match even one hundredth, or a thousandth, one hundred thousandth, or a millionth part of what is rendered by the latter. In fact, no number, fraction, enumeration, analogy, or comparison would suffice. And why? Because, Dṛḍhamati, all of the former type of service is based on substance, and hence is limited and imperfect.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-300}} “Dṛḍhamati, diligent pursuit of the Dharma causes an increase in discipline, absorption, and insight. It ripens the qualities of buddhahood. It ripens inconceivable skillful means and purifies buddha realms. Hence, the Thus-Gone One has taught that unexcelled and perfect awakening depends on abundant learning.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-301}} “Dṛḍhamati, imagine that this trichiliocosm is full of thus-gone ones—as full as a grove of reeds, a paddy field, a sesame field, or a bamboo grove. Imagine then that someone spends his or her entire life paying respect to, honoring, venerating, and worshiping all those thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect buddhas, offering them garments, foods, bedding, mattresses, medicines, and other material things. Moreover, if any one of those thus-gone ones passes completely beyond suffering that person will construct a memorial for them {{page:{number:89,folio:F.45.b}}} that measures a league in circumference, is made of the seven precious substances, is sheltered below parasols, is adorned with altars, shines for an eon with the blazing light of oil lamps, and is adorned with beautiful offerings. Dṛḍhamati, what do you think? Will such a noble son or daughter engender abundant merit?”
“Blessed One, that person will produce merit beyond number and measure,” replied Dṛḍhamati.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-303}} “Dṛḍhamati,” said the Blessed One, “try to imagine and understand this. That person indeed accumulates such merit. However, a noble son or daughter may develop the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening, and so diligently seek to listen to, teach, read, and master the sūtra teachings of the Bodhisattva Collection, the teachings that ripen the factors of awakening. In this regard, Dṛḍhamati, the heaps of merit that are acquired by the former person cannot match even one hundredth, or a thousandth, a hundred thousandth, or a billionth part of the mass of merit that is achieved by this latter person. In fact, no number, fraction, enumeration, analogy, or comparison would suffice.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-304}} “Therefore, Dṛḍhamati, if you intend to don your armor for the sake of listening to, recollecting, reading, and mastering such sūtras in the future, during the final five hundred years, then, Dṛḍhamati, I shall not state any measure regarding the amount of merit that you will obtain. I shall mention neither limits nor an end to it.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-305}} “Dṛḍhamati, if you wish to hear an analogy for the amount of merit that is obtained by developing the awakened mind, or if you wish to gain just a sense of what it is like, then let me ask you whether you have heard of the thus-gone ones’ supernatural powers, and if you are capable of believing in them.”
“Blessed One,” replied Dṛḍhamati, {{page:{number:90,folio:F.46.a}}} “I can accept the powers of the Blessed One.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-307}} “Dṛḍhamati,” asked the Blessed One, “what do you think? Is the trichiliocosm large?”
“Blessed One, yes it is,” replied Dṛḍhamati.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-309}} “Dṛḍhamati,” asked the Blessed One, “what do you think? What if the trichiliocosm were full of sesame seeds, and each of those sesame seeds itself became a container the size of a trichiliocosm, all filled up with sand? Dṛḍhamati, what do you think? Would all that amount to a large pile of sand?”
“Yes, Blessed One,” replied Dṛḍhamati, “it would.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-311}} “Dṛḍhamati,” continued the Blessed One, “what then if a man appeared who would grab handfuls of this sand and toss it in the four directions, and if, whenever he did so, a wind would catch each individual grain of sand and carry it into its own distinct universe? Dṛḍhamati, what do you think? How many worlds would there be in the east, and how many would there be in the other directions?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-312}} “Blessed One, this would be beyond measure,” replied Dṛḍhamati. “Blissful One, it would be beyond measure.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-313}} “Dṛḍhamati, try to imagine. Dṛḍhamati, try to understand,” continued the Blessed One. “Dṛḍhamati, in the case of the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas, their conduct, path, transcendent discipline, transcendent miraculous abilities, and transcendent insight are all beyond measure. Dṛḍhamati, if he so wishes, a thus-gone one {{page:{number:91,folio:F.46.b}}} may traverse all those universes in a single step, and yet neither will his conduct be rushed, nor will he have displayed the full extent of his transcendent, supernatural powers. Within the time of a finger-snap and with just one single step a thus-gone one can walk across all those universes—one universe for each grain of sand. He can do so in the east, as well as in all the rest of the ten directions, and he can do so for a day, a fortnight, a month, a year, a hundred years, a thousand years, or a hundred thousand years. He can walk throughout each direction for a hundred billion years. Well, Dṛḍhamati, would you say that the worlds that can thus be crossed by a thus-gone one are many?”
“Yes, Blessed One, they are many,” replied Dṛḍhamati.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-315}} “Dṛḍhamati,” continued the Blessed One, “if such merit had form it could not even be contained within all those universes. It would be even larger. Dṛḍhamati, the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas know all these heaps of merit completely. Such merits are beyond measure, innumerable, limitless, ineffable, and beyond count, and yet the thus-gone one knows them completely. Dṛḍhamati, I am not aware of any number of syllables, or any number of letters, or any number of digits that can convey the knowledge of such heaps of merit. In the end there would be nothing but innumerable numbers, numbers beyond measure.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-316}} This concludes the third chapter. {{page:{number:92,folio:F.47.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-317}} At that time there was in the east—beyond countless and limitless universes—a world known as Sound of Renown. Within that universe resided a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha known as Majestic Mountain. Abiding and remaining present there, he taught the Dharma. The blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Majestic Mountain had just prophesied that following himself the bodhisattva Luminous Sphere of Great Splendor, who was present in the gathering there, would awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-318}} The bodhisattva Luminous Sphere of Great Splendor had witnessed the great light, heard the special sound, and sensed the ground quaking. Now he approached the blessed thus-gone Majestic Mountain and asked, “Blessed One, who is behind this light, this special sound, and the ground shaking?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-319}} The blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Majestic Mountain then said to the bodhisattva Luminous Sphere of Great Splendor, “Noble son, to the west of this buddha realm, far beyond countless and limitless universes, there is a world known as Enduring. There resides the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni. Abiding and remaining present there, he is delivering Dharma teachings on the Bodhisattva Collection to a retinue that contains incomparable bodhisattva beings. {{page:{number:93,folio:F.47.b}}} Noble son, in the ten directions, throughout universes as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Ganges, there is nobody who wears an armor as strong as the one that is borne by those holy beings. Noble son, even coming to hear of these beings is extremely difficult, let alone beholding and venerating them.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-320}} “Blessed One,” said the bodhisattva Luminous Sphere of Great Splendor, “I wish to go to that world known as Enduring, so that I may see, venerate, and serve the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni, and so that I may see those bodhisattva great beings who bear such inconceivable armor.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-321}} “Noble son, if you know that the time has come, then go,” replied the blessed Majestic Mountain. “Offer that blessed one these seven lotus flowers, and tell him that the blessed thus-gone Majestic Mountain inquires whether he has encountered but little hardship and discomfort, and whether he remains healthy, strong, and at ease.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-322}} The bodhisattva great being Luminous Sphere of Great Splendor then looked at the thus-gone Majestic Mountain. He bowed his head to the Thus-Gone One’s feet and then left. As fast as an athlete can stretch out or bend an arm, the bodhisattva Luminous Sphere of Great Splendor now disappeared from that universe and instantaneously appeared here in the world of Enduring. Arriving at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana by Rājagṛha he went before the Blessed One. He bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet and sat to one side. {{page:{number:94,folio:F.48.a}}} Then he addressed the Blessed One: “Blessed One, the blessed thus-gone Majestic Mountain inquires whether you have encountered but little hardship or discomfort, and whether you remain healthy, strong, and at ease. He also sends you these lotus flowers.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-323}} The Blessed One accepted the flowers and asked, “Luminous Sphere of Great Splendor, is that blessed one free from ailments? Is he strong and does he remain unchanged and happy?”

{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-329}} Thus, when the seventy-seven thousand bodhisattvas had taken the seven lotus flowers, they offered them to the Blessed One, so that they could each display their skillful means. {{page:{number:97,folio:F.49.b}}} With great love the Blessed One accepted the seven great lotuses, and then said to the bodhisattva great being Ajita, “Ajita, the Thus-Gone One has practiced diligently {{note:{index:21,id:UT22084-048-001-330}}} so that you may give rise to roots of virtue. He has practiced with supreme diligence. Ajita, a thus-gone one, a blessed one, a perfect buddha is extremely difficult to find, supremely difficult to find.

“No, Blessed One, you would not,” replied Ajita.

“No, Blessed One, there would not,” replied Ajita.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-358}} “Thus, Ajita,” the Blessed One continued, “each and every element of awakening depends on the initial engendering of that mind. Ajita, the reason there are so few thus-gone ones is that bodhisattvas are so rare. Ajita, consider this analogy. If there were no butter there would no longer be any clarified butter. Likewise, Ajita, if the mind is not set on awakening one will never become a thus-gone one. Ajita, consider this analogy. When there is butter there is also an uninterrupted supply of clarified butter. Similarly, Ajita, {{page:{number:100,folio:F.51.a}}} when there are bodhisattvas in the world there will also be thus-gone ones. Ajita, consider this analogy. When there is a seed there can also be a sprout. Likewise, Ajita, if there are bodhisattvas in the world there will also be thus-gone ones. Ajita, the reason thus-gone ones are so rare is therefore precisely because bodhisattvas are rare.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-359}} “Ajita, consider this analogy. Compared to the priceless jewels in the ocean, there is a greater number of valuable jewels in general. Similarly, among sentient beings there are only a few who abide by the mind of awakening. In comparison, those who keep the mindset of a hearer or a solitary buddha are so many.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-360}} “Thus, Ajita, those who give rise to the mind of awakening are rare. They are extremely rare. Being so extremely rare, they are like the uḍumbara flower. Those who engender the mind of awakening are priceless, like priceless jewels. Those who engender the mind of awakening are greatly superior, like Mount Meru. Those who engender the mind of awakening are utterly unmoving, like space. Those who engender the mind of awakening are deep, like the ocean.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-361}} “Ajita, those who engender the mind of awakening surpass a trichiliocosm filled with precious jewels. Ajita, when those who engender the mind of awakening have a physical form they are worthy of homage, and, Ajita, they will be protected by hundreds of thousands of mundane beings—gods and others. Therefore, Ajita, persist in the practice of engendering the awakened mind. Do so joyfully, forcefully, clearly, {{page:{number:101,folio:F.51.b}}} boldly, and with commitment.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-362}} “Ajita, you may then wonder what it means to engender the mind of awakening. Arousing the mind of awakening is not something that can be counted or measured. Nevertheless, Ajita, for the sake of comprehension I shall give you just an illustration, just a single example. Long ago in the past, before limitless and innumerable eons, there was a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha, someone wise and virtuous, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman taming beings, an unsurpassable one, a teacher of gods and humans, a blessed buddha by the name of King of Bliss. Ajita, the lifespan of that blessed one was eighty-four thousand years. Ajita, the first assembly of that blessed one’s hearers numbered seven hundred sixty million. The second assembly contained nine hundred sixty million, and the third one billion hearers. Without exception, they were all foe-destroyers who had brought an end to defilement, completed their task, completed their work, laid down the load, achieved their own objectives, exhausted the bonds to existence, and achieved liberation through the mind of equality. At that time there was a royal palace known as Immense Vista, and within that palace resided a king of royal descent who had received anointment. He was known by the name of Lion Glory, and his eminent queen gave birth to two twin boys, one named Aśoka and the other Vigataśoka.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-363}} “Ajita, one day in the palace, when the two boys had grown to be seven years old, they saw the thus-gone King of Bliss enter the royal palace together with a gathering of hearers. {{page:{number:102,folio:F.52.a}}} The boy Aśoka then asked his brother, ‘ Vigataśoka , do you see the thus-gone one, the blessed one, the perfect buddha King of Bliss, as he approaches from afar?’
“ ‘Yes, brother, I see him,’ replied Vigataśoka.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-365}} “ ‘ Vigataśoka ,’ continued Aśoka , ‘I want to become just like the thus-gone one, the blessed one, the perfect buddha King of Bliss.” Prince Aśoka then spoke the following verses to his brother:
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-4003}} “ ‘Behold the protector, supreme among humans, As he heads the saṅgha of monks, Leading them here. Vigataśoka , watch King of Bliss.

{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-370}} “In reply, his brother Vigataśoka spoke the following verses:
“ ‘Even if words are many They do not make things happen. I remain in practice And say nothing at all.

{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-375}} “Young Aśoka then spoke these verses to his brother Vigataśoka:
“ ‘It is for the sake of oneself, and not others, That one would say such things. Therefore, if one does not say anything at all One’s mind is suffering from stinginess. {{page:{number:103,folio:F.52.b}}}

{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-382}} “Young Vigataśoka then spoke again to his brother in verse:
“ ‘Brother, we should go together To ask the Protector Whether your way of developing The mind of awakening, or mine, is the greatest.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-384}} “Young Vigataśoka then descended from the upper story of the palace and, wearing sandals made of jewels and garments worth millions, he went to the place where the thus-gone King of Bliss was residing. There he bowed his head to the thus-gone one’s feet and took a place in the gathering. Young Aśoka , on the other hand, jumped from the upper story, and in this way went before the thus-gone King of Bliss. He also wore precious garments, and he carried a jewel as his crown ornament. But as he arrived, Aśoka offered his garments and jewel to the Blessed One, and the Blessed One accepted those gifts from the boy’s hand.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-385}} “In this way, young Vigataśoka in fact arrived in the Blessed One’s presence later than young Aśoka , who had gotten there much earlier. When Vigataśoka noticed young Aśoka in the gathering around the thus-gone King of Bliss he asked him, ‘ Aśoka , which way did you take to have arrived here before the thus-gone one, the blessed one, the perfect buddha King of Bliss so much earlier?’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-386}} “ ‘Brother,’ replied Aśoka , ‘I jumped from our palace to this place where the Blessed One resides. Without any harm or injury to my body, I got here with great convenience.’ {{page:{number:104,folio:F.53.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-387}} “When he had heard young Aśoka ’s reply, young Vigataśoka offered his sandals and precious garments to the Blessed One and spoke the following verse:

{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-398}} “Ajita, when young Aśoka and young Vigataśoka had spoken these verses {{page:{number:105,folio:F.53.b}}} they both went forth from their homes to become monks under the thus-gone King of Bliss. As soon as they had gone forth, each one of them claimed that he would become a thus-gone one much earlier than the other. The monk Aśoka then asked the monk Vigataśoka , ‘What sort of mindset have you aroused, since you claim that you will be the first to awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood?’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-399}} “ ‘ Aśoka ,’ replied Vigataśoka , ‘I think in this way: until I have awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, I shall never give up the mind of awakening, even if I must bring every single being to maturation by remaining in hell for a hundred thousand eons. Such is the quality of the mind that I bring forth. Aśoka , even if people come from the east, and from all the other directions, and place upon my head piles of feces, fire, or dirt, or a pot of excrement, fire, or dirt, I shall not allow that to make me angry and lose my temper. I shall not scowl angrily at such people, nor shall I speak spitefully of revenge. Instead, I shall practice the perfections for the sake of those very people who attack me. Therefore, all their acts serve only to generate the wisdom of the buddhas. All their acts serve only to engender the qualities of the buddhas. If I, in the face of such abuse, were to abandon my equipoise, then how would I be able to accomplish the perfection of patience? What should be extraordinary about this, if such circumstances for ill will would not come up? Therefore, in order to mature those very beings {{page:{number:106,folio:F.54.a}}} and cause them to pass beyond suffering, I shall don my armor. Thinking in this way, I bear the armor of patience. If, when such beings seek to harm me, I attempt to retaliate, then how would I be any better than them? Aśoka , such is the armor that I bear.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-400}} “The monk Aśoka then said to the monk Vigataśoka , ‘Brother, have you seen that mind of yours, which bears such armor?’
“The monk Vigataśoka replied, ‘If there were no mind there would not be any donning of such armor either. If there were no armor, then neither could it be shown. Aśoka , because there is mind the armor can also be shown.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-402}} “The monk Aśoka then told the monk Vigataśoka , ‘You must not say “Just as there is mind there is also armor”! And why not? Because, Vigataśoka , the mind is subject to arising and destruction, and is therefore like an illusion. And an illusory mind that is subject to arising and destruction is neither there nor not there. Vigataśoka , a view is involved whether something is there or not, and any such view of presence or absence is a wrong view. Whenever there is wrong view, one is on an errant path, a wrong path. One is not on the path of awakening, and hence one is far from awakening, not near it. Reaching awakening will be hard.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-403}} “ ‘Therefore, Vigataśoka , all that is mental construction. Anything that involves mental construction and conceit is not something for a bodhisattva to rely on. What, then, should a bodhisattva rely on? A bodhisattva should not rely on anything. And why not? Because if one relies on something, one does not properly rely. Thus, a bodhisattva should {{page:{number:107,folio:F.54.b}}} not be attached to anything. And why not? Because awakening is baseless. And should a bodhisattva conceptualize this, that would not be right. Why not? Because awakening is beyond concepts. If a bodhisattva should become fixed on this, that would not be right. Why not? Because awakening is beyond fixation. Should a bodhisattva think in such ways, that would not be right. Why not? Because awakening knows no concepts. If a bodhisattva determines this, that would not be right. Why not? Because awakening has no characteristics. If a bodhisattva comprehends this, that would not be right. And why not? Because awakening does not change. Should a bodhisattva believe that there is something to actualize, that would not be right. And why not? Because there is no awakening and because awakening is beyond syllables.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-404}} “The monk Vigataśoka then said to the monk Aśoka , ‘ Aśoka , why should there not be any awakening? Let me explain: Vigataśoka is here and, since I am here, there is also awakening.’
“ ‘Brother,’ replied the monk Aśoka , ‘please do not think that nonconceptual awakening either exists or does not exist. And why? Because as long as there are concepts there is no awakening. And why? Because awakening does not involve any concepts. This is how it is. Or, in other words, the more constructs, the more awakening.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-406}} “ ‘Brother’ said Vigataśoka , ‘I do not understand what you mean by saying “the more constructs, the more awakening.” ’
“The monk Aśoka then said to his brother, ‘Brother, for that reason let us together go before the blessed thus-gone King of Bliss.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-408}} “The two of them {{page:{number:108,folio:F.55.a}}} then went to the place where the blessed thus-gone King of Bliss was residing. Having bowed their heads to his feet, they sat to one side, and from there they conveyed their entire conversation to the Blessed One. In response, the Blessed One expressed his approval to the one monk, saying, ‘Excellent, Aśoka .’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-409}} “The blessed one then turned to Vigataśoka and said, ‘ Vigataśoka , this is how it is. The more constructs, the more awakening. Why? Because all constructs are void, and so is awakening. What then is voidness? Voidness is a construct. And what are constructs? They are thought. That is to say, there are the constructs of form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness; the constructs of discipline and absorption; the constructs of few desires and contentment; and the constructs of being easily satisfied and being distinct. Where do constructs come from? They come from thinking, that is to say, from the thought of form to the thought of absorption—each thought is construction. Whatever is thought has no form, and thus thinking is not something with form. That which is thought is absence of thought. That which is thought is neither discipline nor anything else, up to and including contentment. And awakening is the emptiness of form. Awakening is the emptiness of feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness. So also with discipline, absorption, few desires, contentment, being easily satisfied, and being easily nourished—all are emptiness. And emptiness is neither sameness nor difference. That, precisely, is what awakening is.’ {{page:{number:109,folio:F.55.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-410}} “When the monk Vigataśoka heard this teaching of the Dharma he gained the acceptance that phenomena do not arise. He also clearly understood what kind of mind makes someone a bodhisattva; he understood what the mind of awakening is. In this way the monks Aśoka and Vigataśoka developed special insight into, and clear knowledge of, all phenomena. With such conviction about all phenomena they persisted diligently, without any weariness or sleepiness, for eighty thousand years, whereas before they had always been involved in nothing but the pursuit of their desires. Thus, they did not give rise to any desire, anger, or dullness. Upon their death and passing, their next birth in the world took place in the buddha realm known as Harmony with a Thousand Buddha Realms , the realm of the thus-gone Saṃvṛtta­skandha, and there they continued their diligent pursuits.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-411}} “Ajita, in this way those two bodhisattvas went on to serve six hundred and eighty million buddhas, and in each life they lived they would always go forth and practice diligently. Then, finally, the bodhisattva great being Aśoka awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood and appeared in the world as the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha known as Array of the Perfect Assembly. After that the bodhisattva Vigataśoka awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood and he became the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha known as Supreme Accumulations . Ajita, the teachings of those two became extremely vast. Ajita, the lifespans of those two thus-gone ones were unfathomably long.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-412}} “Ajita, the mind of a bodhisattva is not transferred anywhere, {{page:{number:110,folio:F.56.a}}} nor is it adopted in any way.

{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-681}} That universe was of a checkered design and adorned with jewel garlands and jewel threads. In each of the squares grew jewel trees that reached a height of seventy-seven thousand leagues. To the sides the trees would extend their branches, twigs, and leaves, spanning a distance of eighty-four thousand leagues, and on each tree grew eight hundred million jewels. In that buddhafield there were trees of this kind beyond number and count. All the lotus petals and jewels would shine with a constant brilliance, and yet their light was eclipsed by that of the Blessed One.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-682}} Now, the bodhisattva Unimpeded Armor had also noticed the great light and heard the sound of the clear voice. He therefore went before the blessed one Numerous Manifestations and asked, “Blessed One, whose is this radiance and clear voice?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-683}} “Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “in the west, beyond a thousand innumerable universes, lies a universe known as Enduring. Within it resides the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni. Abiding and remaining present there, he is delivering the Dharma teachings that are known as the Bodhisattva Collection. What you witness is his power.” {{page:{number:146,folio:F.74.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-684}} The bodhisattva then said to that blessed one, “Blessed One, I wish to go to that universe so that I may see, venerate, and serve the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-685}} The blessed thus-gone Numerous Manifestations then placed a great lotus flower in the bodhisattva Unimpeded Armor’s hand and said, “Noble son, offer this to the Blessed One, and inquire with him appropriately on my behalf.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-686}} Thus, having received his permission, the bodhisattva bowed his head to the feet of that blessed one. As fast as an athlete can stretch out or bend an arm, he disappeared from that world and arrived at once, in one instant and in one moment, here in the world of Enduring. There he went to the place where the blessed thus-gone Śākyamuni was residing, bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet in homage, and said, “Blessed One, the blessed thus-gone Numerous Manifestations inquires whether you have encountered but little hardship or discomfort, and whether you remain healthy, strong, and at ease. He also sends you this great lotus flower. Please accept it out of your love for us all.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-687}} The Blessed One received the lotus flower and then asked, “Noble son, is that blessed one free from discomfort? Is he strong, happy, and does he remain unchanged?”
“Yes indeed, Blessed One,” answered the bodhisattva.

But, Blessed One, although I am present in this universe, I still perceive all other realms of the world. I see all the thus-gone ones and I see all the bodhisattvas. Bodhisattvas do not think, ‘We should go to a different universe. We should meet another thus-gone one.’ And why? Because they remain in one world, yet perceive all thus-gone ones. Thus, Blessed One, it is simply due to the thus-gone ones’ cultivation of the mind of awakening, and because of their powers, that we have arrived in this universe. All the other bodhisattvas who are present here have likewise arrived due to the past aspirations of the thus-gone ones, and because of their powers.”

Then, while the Blessed One was dwelling in the immovable absorption, the gods of the pure realms praised him in these verses:
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1173}} “Having discovered the immutable, you are beyond movement and fluctuation. Forbidding, majestic mountain —how beautiful you are! Having subdued all hostile attacks You accept the billionfold universe. {{page:{number:229,folio:F.115.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1174}} “The mind of a buddha never takes any support. Supreme is the person who practices concentration without support. ‘Being concentrated’ is just a name, for there is no remaining in anything. Such are the inconceivable qualities of the buddhas.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1175}} “The sages escape the three realms and possess the three classes. {{note:{index:35,id:UT22084-048-001-1176}}} Constantly in equipoise, they have no qualms. Please sever all doubts and dispel all qualms. Please teach the Dharma for the good of all beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1177}} “The sage is resting, free from all qualms. The bodhisattvas gathered here Are heroes, masters of the Dharma who abide within it. We request that you cut through qualms and dispel all doubts.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1178}} “Buddhas do not practice concentration with the support of the eye; Buddhas practice without the eye’s support. Support, no support, and eye—none of these apply. Such is the concentration that is praised by noble beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1179}} “If the sages practiced concentration with the support of the eye The victorious ones would not be pleased. When here concentration is practiced without the eye There is no buddha and no supported meditation.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1180}} “Buddhas do not practice with the support of the six faculties; Victorious ones do not have faculties and are not supported. About this point the extremists and many others remain in delusion. The world of the wanderers, including the gods, all fail to realize this.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1181}} Now the Blessed One emerged from the immovable absorption and looked upon the gathering of bodhisattvas. Then he said to the venerable Śāradvatī­putra, “Śāradvatī­putra, for those who have entered the Great Vehicle, four qualities serve to protect from degeneration. These four qualities likewise serve to gather the merit of all roots of virtue; accomplish the wisdom of the buddhas beyond focal points; accomplish the power of generosity; accomplish the power of discipline; accomplish the power of patience; accomplish the power of love; accomplish the power of compassion; accomplish the power of absorption; accomplish the power of insight; {{page:{number:230,folio:F.116.a}}} accomplish the ten powers of the thus-gone ones without impediment; accomplish the discernment of insight; accomplish unhindered eloquence; accomplish the eloquence that is uninterrupted, joyous, sharp, and profound; attain retention; attain vision of the buddhas; attain renunciation without ever separating from the appropriate virtuous accumulations; ensure that one’s enjoyments are not deficient; ensure that one’s circle of helpers is not incomplete; ensure that one’s body is not deficient; ensure that the major and minor parts of one’s body are not incomplete; ensure that one’s eyes, nose, ears, tongue, and body are not deficient; ensure that one’s mind is not deficient; ensure that one does not take a bad path; ensure that one’s mind is not disturbed; ensure that one’s mindfulness is not obscured; ensure that one remains mindful; ensure that one possesses supreme mindfulness; ensure that one is conscientious and decent; ensure that one refrains from negative acts; ensure regret of wrongdoing; ensure that one’s mindfulness is unbroken; ensure that birth is reversed; and ensure that one will remain mindful.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1182}} “Thus, because one is very mindful, one’s past aspirations will not dissipate. Because one produces roots of virtue in relation to the blessed buddhas, one will engender unfathomable accumulations of roots of virtue in a way that does not grasp and is free from a sense of ‘mine.’ Such stores will be shared with all beings, and yet one will be skilled in disengaging from observing any beings. One will achieve realization with respect to all phenomena, yet one will not take the support of any phenomenon. Since one takes no such support, one remains indomitable by māras, gods of the māra class, or any other being who has entered an unfortunate path. Instead one will become the guardian of the seat of awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1183}} “Residing upon one’s seat one will enter the absorption of the stainless seal of mastery with regard to all phenomena. {{page:{number:231,folio:F.116.b}}} Thus, in a single instant of insight one will understand, view, attain, and actualize everything, down to the smallest object of knowledge. All will be actualized, and one will understand everything. There will be nothing but realization of everything, nothing but comprehension of everything, and all the linking of habitual tendencies will be attained without exception. {{note:{index:36,id:UT22084-048-001-1184}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1185}} “What, then, are those four qualities? Śāradvatī­putra, one starts by donning the great armor of entering the Great Vehicle. Thus, one thinks, ‘All these sentient beings are full of desire, anger, and bewilderment; they are dying without a protector; they are quickly approaching death; they are falling from a great precipice; they are gripped by death and can hardly be brought to life.’ Thinking in this way, one dons the armor of seeing sentient beings by means of the great view.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1186}} “Thus, one pledges to accomplish the Great Vehicle that frees from the three realms so that one can teach it to sentient beings. Understanding that sentient beings must be healed, one pledges to care for them, even when not being entreated or asked to do so. ‘I shall nurture all beings by helping them attain the immutable nature of form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness, as well as the immutable nature of the path that transcends suffering.’ Thinking in this way, one dons the armor and persists in the pursuit of Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1187}} “Which Dharma does one then pursue? The maturation of the factors of awakening and the qualities of buddhahood. {{page:{number:232,folio:F.117.a}}} That is to say, one pursues the Dharma in order to apprehend those Dharma teachings that eliminate the doubts of all beings and satisfy them, and in order to accomplish the fully developed faculties.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-4004}} “As one diligently pursues the Dharma, one should, at a minimum, carry upon one’s body a profound verse that includes the name of a buddha. Even if one carries just such a single four-lined skillful and profound verse, one must also teach it to others, even if it is just to one single person. And when one teaches it, one should pray, ‘May all beings comprehend the meaning of this teaching and the meaning of this verse.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1188}} “By the power of the associated roots of virtue, four things ensue that are supreme, paramount, and consummate. They are granted by the buddhas and by noble beings, praised by the learned, and beyond reproach from the wise. What are those four things? Undivided mindfulness; certain recollection of the qualities of the buddhas; becoming a proper vessel of the Dharma; and becoming a support for the blessed buddhas. Based on those, the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas will teach the Dharma. From the attainment of the second of these qualities, the attainment of retention will follow. As one reverses the process of taking birth, one will reach the full attainment of the buddhas’ awakening. One will be born into a family of people who do not have an evil view, one will go forth in and follow the teachings of the blessed buddhas, and one will relinquish the five sense pleasures.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1189}} “From the attainment of these four qualities, the associated roots of virtue will also bring forth a set of ten qualities. {{page:{number:233,folio:F.117.b}}} What are those ten? They are the accomplishment of eliminating the doubts of all sentient beings; the attainment of the support for all sentient beings; the attainment of the buddhas’ liberation free of obscuration; achieving the stage of a thus-gone one through the gateways of liberation ; shining forth billions of light rays, beyond number and count, from each single hair follicle on one’s body; illuminating hundreds of thousands of buddha realms with every single light ray; emanating hundreds of thousands of lotuses with each single light ray; emanating the body of a thus-gone one from each of those lotuses; letting each of those thus-gone ones ripen trillions of beings through teaching the Dharma, thus ripening them in accord with the attainment of the immutable intrinsic nature of form; and employing such freedom from obscuration to the effect that mountains of fire can blaze forth from each body hair, and rivers equal to the amount of sand grains in the river Ganges can gush forth from the very same body hairs, all the while employing such perfect freedom without obscuration to the effect that the thus-gone ones may penetrate an entire trichiliocosm with the tip of a hair and hurl that entire universe away, beyond more universes than there are grains of sand in the river Ganges, without any of the sentient beings living there getting the sense that their world has been transferred.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1190}} “Śāradvatī­putra, endowed with such unobscured and perfect freedom, the thus-gone ones are aware of everything that is said throughout all directions. They are aware of all that has transpired within the minds of all beings throughout a trillion years. They dispel each of the doubts regarding the Dharma that may have arisen within sentient beings throughout a trillion years. Where no thus-gone one has appeared and no Dharma remains {{page:{number:234,folio:F.118.a}}} their perfect freedom enables them to know when the minds of sentient beings are destroyed, upheld, connected, or in movement.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1191}} “Śāradvatī­putra, thus-gone ones who have gained this perfect freedom without any obscuration are aware of the factors that individually obscure all phenomena. The fact that they alone have penetrated the ultimate, that they know the emptiness of all entities to be itself without entity, or that they care for all gives rise to no self-oriented perception. They recognize as close to them those who think only of the Dharma, but with that exception they have no self-oriented perception of any close ones at all. Recognizing as not close to them those who engage in what is not the Dharma, they see not even a single good quality within the entirety of conditioned things. They know all conditioned things to be devoid of good qualities and full of flaws. Such are the qualities that they attain.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1192}} “They also obtain another set of four qualities. What are those four? The thus-gone ones are able to interrupt the continuity of habitual tendencies. When they walk along a path, all the living creatures that are touched by the thus-gone ones’ feet will be guided toward happy states. A thus-gone one need glance no more than a wheel’s width ahead for the whole earth within sixty-two leagues to the southwest to start moving. {{note:{index:37,id:UT22084-048-001-1193}}} Śāradvatī­putra, the thus-gone ones never have their minds not in equipoise; Śāradvatī­putra, the thus-gone ones are always in equipoise. Śāradvatī­putra, the thus-gone ones know no diminishing of their absorption; they know no departure from their absorption.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1194}} “In short, Śāradvatī­putra, all the qualities of the thus-gone ones depend on the pursuit of the Dharma.” {{page:{number:235,folio:F.118.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1195}} Then the Blessed One spoke these verses:
“Through having compassion for all beings As well as respect for the Dharma, One will reach the other shore of wisdom In the vehicle intended for that goal.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1197}} “Those who wish to understand the minds of beings And realize supernatural powers That are unwavering throughout the three worlds Should have respect for the Dharma.

What is expertise in learning ? Śāradvatī­putra, learning is to be imparted a message from another. Expertise in learning is to consider it properly for oneself and understand it well. Śāradvatī­putra, {{page:{number:237,folio:F.119.b}}} what is meant here by a message from another ? It is the Dharma in all its facets: the sections of sūtras, expressions in mingled prose and verse, prophetic declarations, verses, special aphorisms, narratives, parables, tales of past lives, extensive teachings, miraculous accounts, established instructions, and legends.

Śāradvatī­putra, I do not speak in conformity with the world. Thus I taught the statement, ‘The world speaks in conformity with me,’ with an indirect intention in mind. Śāradvatī­putra, the expertise that was taught by the Thus-Gone One was not taught by him at all. {{page:{number:239,folio:F.120.b}}} Therefore, the Thus-Gone One is, in this way, an expert in the aggregates, the elements, and the sense sources. Since there is no expertise in them at all, the Thus-Gone One has taught expertise in such things.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1228}} “Such expertise goes as follows: The Thus-Gone One teaches the examination of phenomena. But what, Śāradvatī­putra, is phenomena and what is its examination? Śāradvatī­putra, the eyes are said to be phenomena, as are the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. So how, Śāradvatī­putra, are the eyes phenomena? Śāradvatī­putra, eyes are so known in the past, future, and present, but since they are emptiness, they are not perceived. Why is that? Because that is their nature. And just like the eyes, so is the nature of the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind also emptiness. What, then, is an examination into the eyes? It is a searching inquiry into the eyes. And how does one inquire into the eyes? Well, the eyes are not perceived in the eyes. Why is that? Because if the eyes had eyes, then there would be two sets of eyes and there would be a person present within. In that way, that which is the designation of ‘eyes’ consists of a designation, a phenomenon, and eyes.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1229}} “Bodhisattvas who maintain a proper vision of this matter will investigate it as follows: ‘Among the eyes, the designation of eyes, and phenomena, is there any true foundation?’ When investigating it in that way, they will think, ‘These all belong to the domain of language and possess no basis for a true foundation. Why is that? What is comprehended and communicated through language is mundane. What is mundane is not transcendent. What is not transcendent is a position held by the nirgranthas. It is an expression of the nirgranthas. The expressions of the nirgranthas are not the speech of the Buddha, {{page:{number:240,folio:F.121.a}}} for the Thus-Gone One has taught the transcendent. What is not transcendent was not taught by him. Although the Thus-Gone One is accomplished in speech, he teaches the Dharma in order to end speech, not to accumulate expressions.’

It is through definitive {{note:{index:42,id:UT22084-048-001-1233}}} virtue. Why is that? It is because the eyes are limbs of existence. And why are they limbs of existence? They are called limbs of existence due to their cause. How, Śāradvatī­putra, are they termed existence ? They come into existence because of beings. That is how they appear as eyes. The effect of delighting in the eyes is that beings manifest as a result of thinking that the eyes are the self and belong to the self. Therefore, they are called existence . One begins to grasp based on them. What is grasping? It is taking on suffering. And what is suffering? It is grasping to “I” and “mine.” Both are limbs in this context, and that is why the eyes are called limbs of existence .’

Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas strive for the profound Dharma, pursue only the profound Dharma, and perfectly teach only the profound Dharma. Śāradvatī­putra, what are the profound dharmas in which they become stable? And what, Śāradvatī­putra, is their stability? Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas are called stable because they do not become discouraged or despondent about unexcelled and perfect awakening. Śāradvatī­putra, when it is said that they are stable, it is because they grasp the dharmas. What dharmas do they grasp? Dharmas can be grasped with the eyes; but, Śāradvatī­putra, what the eyes grasp is not dharmas, which are not something held. What, then, is the Dharma, Śāradvatī­putra? It is by nature neither inside, nor outside. It has neither a self, nor does it belong to a self. It has neither affliction, nor purification. {{page:{number:255,folio:F.128.b}}} Dharmas are grasped by the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, but in that respect, what the dharmas are is not the mind and so forth. Śāradvatī­putra, Dharma is something that has neither a self, nor does it belong to a self; it has neither inside, nor outside; it has neither affliction, nor purification; it has neither birth, nor cessation. Why, Śāradvatī­putra? Because that is its nature—its nature is not something made, and does not change, and therefore mind is called Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1319}} “Why, Śāradvatī­putra, is grasping so termed? It enables the grasping of emptiness, and the grasping of signlessness and wishlessness. It enables the grasping of non-perception as wishlessness, for non-perception is wishlessness. Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, dharmas are neither to be removed, nor established. Those who are free of removing and establishing are called graspers of dharmas . Therefore, they are called bodhisattvas . Since bodhisattvas, Śāradvatī­putra, are beings ( sattva ) who are close to the buddhas, they are called bodhisattvas . Since there is no awakening ( bodhi ), they are called bodhisattvas . Alternatively, since the being ( sattva ) enters awakening due to the very non-existence of beings, they are therefore called bodhisattvas.

Therefore, grasping to perception is so termed. The absence of that is termed emptiness ; and emptiness is awakening. Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, all phenomena are awakening, and likewise, perfect buddhahood. Thus, act in harmony and do not act in disharmony with this. This is because awakening is profound—so profound that no immature, ordinary beings progress toward it. And moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, let alone ordinary beings, even worthy ones and solitary buddhas do not progress toward it, despite having actualized knowledge of non-arising, from beholding the knowledge of exhaustion and the knowledge of non-arising. Knowledge of exhaustion comes from bringing what to exhaustion? Knowledge of exhaustion does not come from bringing any phenomenon to exhaustion. Moreover, it is because all phenomena themselves are exhausted that knowledge of exhaustion is so termed. It is because that knowledge belongs to noble beings that knowledge of exhaustion is so termed. Knowledge of exhaustion is so termed because there is no knowledge such as, ‘All this was exhausted,’ ‘Such and such was exhausted,’ or ‘Everything from here on was exhausted.’ Therefore, it is said that not even worthy ones or solitary buddhas progress toward awakening.

This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, there is no place whatsoever, aside from a place consecrated by a thus-gone one, that can withstand the torrent of water from the great nāga king Sāgara.

At some point, a thought occurred to him about his immersion in the town’s business: ‘What kind of knowledge should I gain in order to teach others the sublime Dharma such that, upon teaching them its meaning, all their activities would be fulfilled?’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1393}} “The householder Dhṛtisena then went alone to an isolated place, and while thus contemplating, a deity appeared and said, ‘Householder, there is a thus-gone one called Ārakṣapati Megheśvaradīpa.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1394}} “The householder Dhṛtisena was instantly elated, whereupon the god said, ‘However, householder, he has passed away.’ {{page:{number:270,folio:F.136.a}}} The householder Dhṛtisena then started to cry but the deity then asked him, ‘Householder, why were you first elated, but now you cry?’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1395}} “ ‘Well, god,’ the householder Dhṛtisena replied, ‘I was elated because you said there was a thus-gone one, and I’m crying because you said he has passed away. Deity, since I have never seen a thus-gone one, my life is meaningless.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1396}} “The god then said to the householder Dhṛtisena, ‘Householder, there is a Dharma preacher monk called Prabhakīrti, who was authorized when the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Ārakṣapati Megheśvaradīpa passed away. Householder, that preacher retains the entire Dharma taught by that blessed one, without squandering any of it! Householder, that monk retains that thus-gone one’s treasury of Dharma.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1397}} “ ‘Where, god, does that Dharma preacher now dwell?’ the householder Dhṛtisena asked the deity.
“The god replied, ‘Householder, the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti dwells in the town of Kapilavāstu, in the king’s palace. The king’s palace is 6,300 leagues to the east of here.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1399}} “After spending the night there, the householder Dhṛtisena then set out for the palace of the king of Kapilavāstu, carrying eight hundred million cowrie shells and eight hundred million ounces of gold. Once he arrived there, he went to where the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti was, bowed to his feet, and sat to one side. Once the householder Dhṛtisena was seated, the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti {{page:{number:271,folio:F.136.b}}} delivered a Dharma discourse that resolves the doubts of all beings, a Dharma discourse that perfectly satisfies all beings, a fine speech that perfectly inspires roots of virtue among bodhisattvas. The householder Dhṛtisena, who by now had developed devotion for the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti, praised his speech and offered to him all the cowrie shells and gold. He also offered himself to serve and attend upon Prabhakīrti.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1400}} “Śāradvatī­putra, the householder Dhṛtisena was perseverant in serving and attending upon the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti and in pursuing the Dharma, such that he attended upon him for six hundred million years in order to receive, write down, and recite that very Dharma discourse. But for the entire six hundred million years, he never again received that Dharma discourse to listen to, write down, or expound upon. Throughout those six hundred million years that he served the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti he was never impeded by either sloth or sleep. Throughout those six hundred million years of his service to the Dharma preacher he never ever parted from the Dharma. Throughout those six hundred million years of his service to the Dharma preacher he never had a thought of desire, ill will, or aggression toward him. Śāradvatī­putra, the householder Dhṛtisena would not sleep at the threshold of wherever the Dharma preacher was staying but, in order to protect him, would stand at attention without lying down.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1401}} “Śāradvatī­putra, once a māra named Sadā­vatāra­prekṣin appeared. Sadā­vatāra­prekṣin was seeking to bring the householder Dhṛtisena down. Sadā­vatāra­prekṣin thus conjured up as an emanation a monk looking exactly like the monk Prabhakīrti making the acquaintance of a woman. {{page:{number:272,folio:F.137.a}}} Having conjured up that emanation, Sadā­vatāra­prekṣin said to the householder Dhṛtisena, ‘Householder, look at the erroneous thinking and impropriety of that teacher of yours, the famed scholar among teachers, insightful, learned, a veritable ocean of learning! How can he preach to others that they should observe abstinence, and yet indulge in the very perversion of discipline? Look, householder, at how he, although promoting pure conduct, indulges in fornication. Householder, how, in doing such things and behaving in such a way, could his conduct be profound and in observance of abstinence? It is impossible! It is improper! Householder, enough with attending upon him and serving him! Abandon such a monk! Householder, you have discipline, contentment, isolation, mindfulness, and insight. And so, since he is someone with perverted discipline, how can you serve him?’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1402}} “The householder Dhṛtisena now thought, ‘I was inspired by what the god told me about how Ārakṣapati Megheśvaradīpa had authorized a Dharma preacher called Prabhakīrti to uphold the treasury of his Dharma, telling me that I should attend upon him. Accordingly, I went to the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti and he perfectly taught me the Bodhisattva Collection of teachings that resolves all doubts and perfectly satisfies all beings. Out of desire for the Dharma, I then made offerings {{page:{number:273,folio:F.137.b}}} and also offered myself to serve and attend upon him. If I have acted properly, then the words that this person is saying about the impropriety of the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti are the action of Māra. And why? Because otherwise such behavior would be unthinkable and out of the question. For it is impossible that someone who has been authorized by a thus-gone one would display such comportment—there is no doubt about it, so this must be a māra, a god from the māra realm, or a person inspired by Māra. Since the Dharma teaching that I received from the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti showed the absence of characteristics, so should I now regard that woman and the qualities of that woman, and that man and the qualities of that man. If the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti is authorized by a thus-gone one, but I fall under the sway of that improper apparition, I will be denigrating the thus-gone ones and the nature of the thus-gone ones. I will thus invoke the power of truth through the power of aspirations from my own positive intention, and the power of truth of the thus-gone ones.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1403}} “The householder Dhṛtisena then invoked the power of truth, saying, ‘Through the truth and the true words of my exalted intention to pursue the Dharma, if the Dharma preacher was authorized by a thus-gone one to teach the Dharma, may that man and woman vanish!’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1404}} “Śāradvatī­putra, through the householder’s true resolve the woman and man vanished. Once those beings belonging to the realm of Māra had vanished, the householder Dhṛtisena thought, ‘The fact that the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti {{page:{number:274,folio:F.138.a}}} has never again let me listen to the Dharma discourse that perfectly satisfies the wishes of all beings is my own workings of Māra. It is due to the power of Māra, for while I have followed him constantly, intent in the pursuit of Dharma, he has not permitted me to listen to the Dharma discourse of the Bodhisattva Collection. Alas! I will now ensure that I do not fall under the sway of the workings of Māra!’ Śāradvatī­putra, the householder Dhṛtisena thus did not turn away, but continued to follow the Dharma preacher Prabhakīrti.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1405}} “Look at the householder Dhṛtisena’s excellent, exalted motivation, Śāradvatī­putra! He took delight in following the Dharma preacher for six hundred million years. And although he faithfully, and without any dissatisfaction, followed him for six hundred million years, he only heard that Dharma discourse one single time. Although the māra Sadā­vatāra­prekṣin had conjured up that delusive apparition, he did not change his mind, but became even more truly devout toward that Dharma preacher. After the entire period of six hundred million years had passed, the householder Dhṛtisena was reborn in the world of Ratnākara , which was in harmony with a thousand buddha realms. The thus-gone one Mahāskhanda also appeared in that world. Śāradvatī­putra, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Mahāskhanda had an assembly of six hundred million worthy ones.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1406}} “The bodhisattva great being Dhṛtisena was born into the household of a king. Immediately upon birth, the gods said, ‘Child, this fruition of yours is a result of pursuing the Dharma.’

By the power of his previous aspirations and by the power of the Thus-Gone One, he also obtained the power of recollection. He completely retained all the myriad Dharma discourses that the thus-gone one Mahāskhanda taught. He also practiced pure conduct under the teaching of the blessed thus-gone Mahāskhanda. He ripened immeasurable, countless beings for unexcelled and perfect awakening.

At seven years old he went forth under that thus-gone one’s teaching. Having thus gone forth, he obtained the power of recollection, and through the power of his previous aspirations and the blessings of the Thus-Gone One, he was able to recollect all the myriad sūtras that the Thus-Gone One had taught. Śāradvatī­putra, the bodhisattva great being Dhṛtisena consecutively served six hundred forty million buddhas and retained the Dharma taught by them all. Śāradvatī­putra, the bodhisattva great being Dhṛtisena came to possess an oceanic wisdom. Since it was unwavering, he came to possess an unadulterated, space-like wisdom. Since it was difficult to fathom its depths, he came to possess a profound wisdom. Śāradvatī­putra, you should not think that the householder called Dhṛtisena was someone else, for the householder merchant whose mind did not change even after following the Dharma preacher for six hundred million years was Dīpaṃkara. {{page:{number:276,folio:F.139.a}}}

{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1410}} The Blessed One then said to the venerable Śāradvatī­putra, “Śāradvatī­putra, there are three things that bodhisattvas should do, in terms of which to consider correctly everything there is to do and not to do. What are these three things? Śāradvatī­putra, they are as follows.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-4007}} “Because of the very things not to be done, the first thing to do is to pursue the sublime Dharma fully. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas should furthermore pursue the teachings of the buddhas without measuring them, so that even when they hear the profound teachings of the buddhas, they will be unafraid, enthusiastically try to penetrate to their depths, and not abandon them.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1411}} “Śāradvatī­putra, the second thing they should do is not to go back on their perfect exalted intention, which increases the more they hear the profound Dharma. This they should regard as being the perfect exalted intention of bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-4008}} “Śāradvatī­putra, the third thing they should do is not to cower, be discouraged, or turn away when hearing a bodhisattva great being tell someone who has approached them, ‘A bodhisattva who has engendered the attitude set on unexcelled and perfect awakening must abandon all possessions. {{page:{number:277,folio:F.139.b}}} There is nothing that the bodhisattva does not give away.’ This too they should regard as the perfect exalted intention of bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-4013}} “Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, suppose someone approaches a bodhisattva and says, ‘A bodhisattva who has engendered the attitude set on unexcelled and perfect awakening should provide comfort to all beings. Thus, since I, suffering in this way, am severely suffering, then you should first provide comfort to me, and then later provide comfort to all other beings.’ Hearing such a demand, bodhisattvas should be able to ensure that person’s happiness without being discouraged. However, if they fail and become discouraged and dejected, thinking, ‘If I cannot even provide comfort to this being, what use is it for me to do so for all beings,’ then such discouragement should be regarded as not being an exalted motivation.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1412}} “If, Śāradvatī­putra, while providing comfort to such beings, bodhisattvas are criticized and reviled, and berated {{note:{index:52,id:UT22084-048-001-1413}}} with evil, harsh words, unsuitable for polite society, those bodhisattvas should not be angry, or have ill will toward them, but engender feelings of love and compassion for them. Bodhisattvas should provide for their happiness, so that they do not suffer. Śāradvatī­putra, such an exalted intention of bodhisattvas should be known as unexcelled and perfect awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1414}} “Bodhisattvas who arouse a gentle and peaceful mind {{page:{number:278,folio:F.140.a}}} and the intention to comfort others will see to the cutting of immeasurable saṃsāra into pieces. They will see to providing comfort to immeasurable beings. They will see to the ripening of their own buddha qualities. Each time they give rise to the mind of awakening, they will see to the accomplishment of immeasurable buddha qualities. In that way, bodhisattvas should be regarded as possessing an exalted intention and being skilled in methods.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1415}} “Suppose that bodhisattva great beings are criticized and reviled, and berated with evil, harsh words, unsuitable for polite society, by the being on whose behalf those bodhisattvas have provided comfort. In such a case, bodhisattvas who do not neglect or diminish their altruistic intention will exercise patience, thinking, ‘This being is teaching me buddha qualities. So if I were to have any ill will whatsoever toward him, I would be impeded from awakening by precisely that much.’ Such thinking should be regarded as the bodhisattvas’ exalted intention that is skilled in the methods toward unexcelled and perfect awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1416}} “Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, suppose someone approaches a bodhisattva and says, ‘Unexcelled and perfect awakening is difficult to attain—you will not be able to awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood; you will not be able to accomplish the buddha qualities.’ If bodhisattvas, upon hearing that, let go {{note:{index:53,id:UT22084-048-001-1417}}} of the ideas they had, this should be regarded as not being the exalted intention. And if in such a case they imagine that the buddha qualities, which are so difficult to attain, are easy to attain, that should also be regarded as not being the exalted intention.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1418}} “Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, {{page:{number:279,folio:F.140.b}}} suppose someone approaches a bodhisattva and says, ‘Noble son, if one who gives rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening has no control over even their own body and life force, then there is no need to speak of them having control over their possessions. Alas, noble son, since it is impossible for you to have control over your body and life force, give up this attitude!’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1419}} “Bodhisattvas might then think, ‘No one has control over the body and life force, and because they do not have control over them, everyone strives to protect them. While striving to protect them, their bodies perish and cease to be, and their life forces too come to an end. That being the case, there is no question that mine will too.’ Such thinking should be regarded as not being endowed with the exalted intention, and not being skilled in methods.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1420}} “Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas might also think, ‘Everyone strives to protect their body and life force, but they have no control over them. The bodies over which they have no control will perish and cease to be. Then they will be oppressed by the torments of birth, aging, sickness, death, and the like, for by striving to protect their bodies, they will have formed many different kinds of karma. So even as they try to protect their bodies and life force, they still migrate to another body and another life force. Should I have regard for my body and life force and try to protect them, then by so doing I will commit evil deeds and come to experience suffering in saṃsāra, with its five destinies. {{page:{number:280,folio:F.141.a}}} Alas, I will thus give up all concern for my body and life force! I will not protect them! I will also abandon my body and life force! I will act for the wisdom of awakening, and not for my body and life force! I will act striving to liberate all beings! I will rid myself of craving for body and life force! I will take up craving for all the blessed buddhas! I will aspire for the unborn! I will not be weary in teaching the Dharma! I will teach the Dharma that is unbounded and unreleased!’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1421}} “Bodhisattvas may also consider this as follows: ‘I will tell that person this: “Listen, the very absence of control over body and life force is itself the supreme effort. It is itself the supreme armor. That is because all phenomena are indeed without intrinsic nature. All phenomena are indeed without foundation.” ’ Those who say such things should be regarded as possessing the exalted intention.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1422}} “Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, suppose a person were to approach a bodhisattva and say, ‘One who gives rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening must act as a student of all beings, so henceforth you must act as my student.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1423}} “Bodhisattvas might then reply, ‘Listen, I am not just your student, I am the student of all beings. That is because I have taken on the burden of beings. That burden includes the burden of health, the burden of not being fatigued, the burden of happiness, the burden of gaining importance, the burden of the thus-gone ones’ teaching, the burden of listening to the sublime Dharma, the burden of accomplishing the Dharma received, and the burden of becoming liberated. {{page:{number:281,folio:F.141.b}}} Such being the burdens, they fatigue neither body nor mind. Originating neither with oneself nor others, they bring pain to neither oneself nor others. That being the case, when you tell me to become the student of yourself alone, I will ask you what you need. If you say that you need my body and life force, then I will grant you my body and life force. But I will not abandon you. You should not give rise to the idea that phenomena, which are without owner and lord, have a lord! Once you have given rise to the idea of a lord, and then commit negative deeds based on that, you will be propelled by negative actions toward unfortunate destinies. In those unfortunate destinies you will be miserable, performing negative actions. If you do not agree, then just do as you please!’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1424}} “Śāradvatī­putra, if bodhisattvas observe such disregard for body and life force, then, Śāradvatī­putra, their exalted intention should be regarded as unexcelled and perfect awakening, for it approaches unexcelled and perfect awakening, sustains their unexcelled and perfect awakening, keeps saṃsāra at a distance, approaches omniscient wisdom, ripens beings, purifies buddha realms, and cultivates their roots of virtue.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1425}} “As a simile, Śāradvatī­putra, suppose a jeweler finely polishes a priceless, precious gem, so that it becomes correspondingly dazzling and pristine. Thinking that the king will grant him a gift {{note:{index:54,id:UT22084-048-001-1426}}} for this, the jeweler might then set his eyes on his perfect possession. {{page:{number:282,folio:F.142.a}}} He might then also receive a fine reception from the king or from other experts and show them the precious gem’s qualities. The king, prince, ministers, and experts will then be elated upon seeing the precious gem, delighting in its qualities. Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, as much as bodhisattva great beings remain in the discernment of equanimity, to that degree they cultivate the wisdom of awakening, their own roots of virtue. They too will be able to grant gifts {{note:{index:55,id:UT22084-048-001-1427}}} and encounter the blessed buddhas. The blessed buddhas will instruct them and they will cause all beings to progress.

Once it has fully grown, it would then be able to prevent and cure the illnesses of immeasurable, countless beings, and enable healthy beings to progress. Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas develop buddha qualities precisely to the extent to which they give rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening; develop roots of virtue; pursue knowledge of the Dharma; strive in pursing the Dharma; and likewise, protect against the workings of Māra and the afflictions. {{page:{number:283,folio:F.142.b}}} Once they have fully developed such qualities, they vanquish the illnesses of immeasurable, countless beings and apply the salve of wisdom; and once they have fully awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, they enable beings with and without afflictions, including the worlds of gods, humans, and demigods, to progress.

This is because, noble son, bodhisattvas will be reborn in the hells innumerably many times, precisely to the extent that there are beings there to liberate. They alone will need to experience the suffering of all those beings. Accordingly, I must experience my own suffering alone, whereas you alone must experience the suffering of giving rise to the mind set on omniscient wisdom, for you will experience suffering if you are to liberate all beings.

That being the case, it is only wise to say, “Upon hearing it, I will judge.” This is how the circumspect behave. It is an act of careful investigation. Asking me to follow your words at all costs is not how the circumspect behave, nor is it praised by the wise. Rather, it is the workings of a māra, and not the activity of a buddha. It would therefore be improper if I had to go back on my former promise in case you were to give me non-Dharmic advice. So, I will not promise that at all costs.

Likewise, if someone says, “Do not rely on what is full of faults! Rely on what has only a few faults!” one should actually not rely upon either. What, then, should the wise rely upon?

If one does not give rise to the mind set on awakening, the faults are fewer, so it is excellent that you think that whether something has many or few faults, neither should be relied upon.

Indeed, since both involve a fall into error, one should neither rely on something with many faults nor on something with few faults. Prince, the main point here is just this: nirvāṇa is the abandonment of all aggregates. Prince, what is the benefit of repeatedly experiencing the faulty existences of saṃsāra where one will have to repeatedly die? Rather, you should aspire for nirvāṇa. Prince, for beings to dwell in the womb is suffering. Separation from the desirable and encountering the undesirable is suffering. Prince, to take the body, which is without essence and impermanent, to be one’s leader is suffering. The impermanence of the life force is suffering. The impermanence and essencelessness of pleasures is suffering. Prince, dying over and over again is suffering. Prince, that is why I say to you, the appearance of a thus-gone one, the obtainment of a human birth, excellent leisure, and unexcelled faith in a thus-gone one’s teaching are difficult to obtain. {{page:{number:293,folio:F.147.b}}} Therefore, Prince, having obtained these things, do not throw them away!

As beings are repeatedly tormented by birth, old age, sickness, and death, I hope that I may fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, and thus free them from the fears of birth, old age, sickness, and death, so that beings no longer repeatedly fall under their sway.

While undergoing such hardships and being forced to give up my possessions, rivers of blood flowed from my dismembered body, which tormented my mind.

For if this person has encountered such suffering, then for all those beggars to come, from those requesting his limbs and appendages to those divesting him of his life force, he must have committed negative actions in the past. However, those beggars would only contribute toward my unexcelled and perfect awakening. This is because those beings are ignorant and perpetuate ignorance.

Nirvāṇa is devoid of nirvāṇa. The eyes are devoid of nirvāṇa. Nirvāṇa is devoid of eyes. The eyes and nirvāṇa are thus identical since neither ever existed.

Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, in this way the correct view accords with what is known by a thus-gone one, for he is utterly devoid of any wrong view. This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, the suchness of his speech is entirely the suchness of speech, in that his speech accords with how things are. That speech, Śāradvatī­putra, is inexpressible.

It is due to the great nāgas’ {{note:{index:64,id:UT22084-048-001-1599}}} abode that they can emerge from the ocean and satiate the world of the four continents with great streams of rain. Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, one should understand that when the mind of awakening engendered by the bodhisattva is steadfast, other bodhisattva great beings awaken to it, so that it serves as a great abode for countless beings. It provides an abode for those qualities. It also provides an abode for the objects of the buddhas. Wicked māras cannot divert beings from it, easily overcome it, or defeat it. {{page:{number:321,folio:F.161.b}}} If māras form ill intentions, thinking that they will enact the workings of the māras, then immediately upon forming such an intention, all the māras’ fetters and intentions will be utterly destroyed.

Afterward, they once again plunge into the great oceans.

As it gradually deepens infinitely, it is steadfast to the very depths. Śāradvatī­putra, this gradual deepening consists of accomplishment of the perfection of generosity, the perfection of discipline, the perfection of patience, the perfection of diligence, and the perfection of concentration. Śāradvatī­putra, its very depths should be understood as the bodhisattva’s perfection of insight. Śāradvatī­putra, its infiniteness should be regarded as the bodhisattva’s accomplishment of skill in means regarding the qualities of the buddhas. Thus, since the limit of reality is manifest from the very beginning, it would be improper were it not to be traversed, and were immeasurable, countless beings and those who want the jewels of the Dharma not to access it.

It is because, Śāradvatī­putra, the steadfastness of the mind set on awakening is similar to that steadfastness. In this way, even were the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the perfect Buddha to teach, starting from there, for an eon, more than an eon, or even longer than that, the topic of the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas would still not be exhausted or depleted. {{page:{number:325,folio:F.163.b}}} This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, the mind of awakening engendered by bodhisattvas is made steadfast by such activities that are hard to subdue; activities that are unparalleled; activities that are exalted, that bring happiness to beings, and that please beings; joyous activities; activities that involve the three realms; activities that involve great wisdom; activities that are difficult to fathom; activities of dispassion; and activities of great illumination.

Śāradvatī­putra, a person could kill that entire assembly of worthy ones. However, someone else might cause a bodhisattva great being, who travels by means of the vehicle to omniscience and wants to enter the city of Dharma of a perfect buddha, to lose interest in the mind of awakening. If that bodhisattva, due to being discouraged from the mind of awakening, were to subsequently discard the mind of awakening, then, Śāradvatī­putra, the former heap of faults would not approach even a hundredth of the heap of faults of the latter—no comparison would ever suffice. That is because destroying that entire assembly of worthy ones would not diminish the ten powers of a thus-gone one. It would not diminish the four fearlessnesses of a thus-gone one. It would not diminish the eighteen unique attributes of a buddha. It would not diminish his great love. It would not diminish his great compassion. It would not diminish the elephant-like gaze of a thus-gone one. It would not diminish the lion-like gait of a thus-gone one. It would not diminish his imperceptible crown protuberance. It would not diminish being replete with millions of conch shells of Dharma. It would not diminish his unexcelled turning of the wheel of Dharma. It would not diminish a thus-gone one from being the best among humans. It would not diminish his knowledge of the superior and lesser faculties of beings. It would not diminish his knowledge of the variety of inclinations. {{page:{number:338,folio:F.170.a}}} Yet, Śāradvatī­putra, discouraging a bodhisattva diminishes all those qualities.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1653}} “Śāradvatī­putra, forget about the world systems with four continents. Śāradvatī­putra, along similar lines, as an analogy, suppose this trichiliocosm were filled with worthy ones, and someone were to kill all those worthy ones—Śāradvatī­putra, I say that the heap of faults caused by discouraging a bodhisattva from the mind of awakening would far exceed the heap of merit caused by killing all those worthy ones. That is because, Śāradvatī­putra, preventing someone from engendering the mind of awakening destroys all awakened qualities. Śāradvatī­putra, if the mind of awakening had not been engendered, the wisdom of awakening would not have currently appeared. Śāradvatī­putra, if the mind of awakening had not been engendered, then such a buddha, the best among men, would not have currently appeared in the world. And it is because, Śāradvatī­putra, if the mind of awakening had not been engendered, then the blessed buddhas would not have currently appeared.
“Indeed, Blessed One,” said Śāradvatī­putra.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1655}} The Blessed One continued, “Śāradvatī­putra, that is why any noble son, noble daughter, monk, nun, layman, laywoman, god, nāga, yakṣa, gandharva, demigod, garuḍa, kiṃnara, or mahoraga, who has the mind of awakening, is worthy of veneration by the world with its gods. {{page:{number:339,folio:F.170.b}}} And why is that? Because, Śāradvatī­putra, it should be understood that those who have engendered that exalted intention eventually will become thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect buddhas.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1656}} “Śāradvatī­putra, what do you think? When the Thus-Gone One teaches the bodhisattva’s engendering of the mind of awakening, does the Thus-Gone One teach on such matters especially to those of the warrior caste who are like a great sāla tree; or to those of the brahmin caste who are like a great sāla tree; or to those of the householder caste who are like a great sāla tree; or to universal monarchs; or to gods of the realm of the four great kings; or to the four great kings; or to Śakra, lord of the gods; or to the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three; or, likewise, to the gods of the heavens of Free from Strife, Joyous , Delighting in Emanations or Making Use of Others’ Emanations; or all the way up to the gods of the Unexcelled Heaven?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1657}} “Not so, Blessed One,” replied Śāradvatī­putra. “That is because the Blessed One teaches only the pure engendering of the mind of awakening, and only the great engendering of the altruistic intention.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1658}} “Śāradvatī­putra, what do you think?” asked the Blessed One. “When teaching the engendering of the mind of awakening, does the Blessed One especially teach it to those with great power, such as teaching it to those with the power of a dignitary, the power of a great dignitary, or half the power of Nārāyāṇa, {{page:{number:340,folio:F.171.a}}} or does he especially teach it to those who are humble, poor, or lofty?”
“Not so, Blessed One,” said Śāradvatī­putra.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1660}} “Śāradvatī­putra,” the Blessed One continued, “it is for this reason that if you see that mind of awakening engendered in anyone, whether they be powerful or weak, humble or lofty, you should protect that engendered intention. Śāradvatī­putra, you should inspire that bodhisattva to uphold it. You should please that bodhisattva. You should encourage that bodhisattva. Śāradvatī­putra, whatever is done to encourage bodhisattvas by inspiring them to uphold the intention and so delighting them is the supreme veneration for hearers. Śāradvatī­putra, it is for this reason that hearers who wish to venerate me should by all means compel and encourage bodhisattvas to take up bodhisattva conduct. Śāradvatī­putra, I fully entrust to the hearers the task of ensuring, by all means, that bodhisattva great beings develop and do not decline.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1661}} The venerable Śāradvatī­putra then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, engendering the mind of awakening has the following three elements: The initial engendering of the mind of awakening, the irreversible engendering of the mind of awakening, and the accomplished engendering of the mind of awakening. That being the case, about which of these engenderings of the mind of awakening has the Blessed One taught in particular regarding its qualities?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1662}} “Śāradvatī­putra, it is exactly as you have said,” the Blessed One answered. {{page:{number:341,folio:F.171.b}}} “Engendering the mind of awakening has the following three elements: the initial engendering of the mind of awakening, the irreversible engendering of the mind of awakening, and the accomplished engendering of the mind of awakening. Śāradvatī­putra, among them, it is the initial engendering of the mind of awakening that bodhisattvas might turn away from and thus fall into the vehicle of the hearers or the vehicle of the solitary buddhas. In such a case, Śāradvatī­putra, the Thus-Gone One makes them take delight in engendering of the mind of awakening, inspires them to uphold it, and encourages them to engender it. This is because he thinks, ‘May bodhisattvas by all means abide in unexcelled and perfect awakening! May they turn away from the intentions of the hearers and solitary buddhas and not base themselves on those two vehicles! May they, by not basing themselves on them, be firm in the awakened qualities and arrive at the object of awakening!’ Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings should apply themselves to accomplishing the birth of the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1663}} “Śāradvatī­putra, one should view the mind as emptiness. Śāradvatī­putra, what is the emptiness of mind? How should one view the mind as emptiness? Śāradvatī­putra, mind is mind, mental cognition, consciousness, mental body, mental faculty, and mental constituent—these are mind. What is its emptiness? Śāradvatī­putra, mind is empty of mind, for it has no creator whatsoever. If it had some creator, then because of that there would be something else that would have experience. Neither does mind itself form mind. If mind formed mind, {{page:{number:342,folio:F.172.a}}} then just that would be the creator and experiencer. If another mind formed mind, then it would belong to that which created it, but even having created it, the other would have experience. Śāradvatī­putra, it is for this reason that mind is empty of mind, for it has no creator whatsoever. That which lacks a creator has not created so much as an iota. In that which has not created so much as an iota no creation can be perceived. That in which no creation can be perceived lacks a point of objection. Those who object to it object to nonexistence. Those who object to nonexistence object to emptiness. They object to signlessness and wishlessness. Those who object to emptiness object to hollowness and futility. Those who object to hollowness and futility argue with the Thus-Gone One. Those who argue with the Thus-Gone One fall off a steep cliff. And what is the steep cliff, Śāradvatī­putra? It is the hells, the animal realm, and the world of Yama. The true steep cliff is as follows: belief in perception, belief in the aggregates, belief in the elements, belief in the sense sources, belief in a life force, belief in emergence, belief in disintegration, belief in sentient beings, and belief in persons. Śāradvatī­putra, in short, even belief in nirvāṇa is a perception, as are belief in the Buddha, belief in the Dharma, and belief in the Saṅgha. Immature, ordinary beings attached to those beliefs will fall off a steep cliff. This steep cliff is none other than saṃsāra.” {{page:{number:343,folio:F.172.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1664}} This concludes the eighth chapter.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1665}} Then, a beggar called Vijayarakṣa came into the assembly and sat down. Having risen from his seat, he draped his robe over one shoulder, bowed to the Blessed One with palms joined, and said, “Blessed One, I do not want to fall off such a cliff, nor argue with the Thus-Gone One, but I do want to awaken to unexcelled and perfect awakening. So I am wondering, Blessed One, how can I, a poor and destitute person, fully awaken to buddhahood when I live off the wealth of others, gaining the luxury of a home through negative conduct and hardship? Perfectly accomplishing awakening is for great, sāla tree-like warriors, brahmins, and householders.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1666}} The Blessed One said, “I do not especially teach to the warrior caste who are like a great sāla tree, or to those of the brahmin caste who are like a great sāla tree, or to those of the householder caste who are like a great sāla tree. Nor do I especially teach to nobles, to the wealthy, or to gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, or mahoragas. Rather, whoever gives rise to the mind of awakening is worthy of veneration by the world with its gods.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1667}} “Blessed One,” said Vijayarakṣa , “from this time forth I give rise to the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening.”
The Blessed One replied to the beggar Vijayarakṣa , “ Vijayarakṣa , you are following the example of the thus-gone ones. Excellent! Excellent!” {{page:{number:344,folio:F.173.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1669}} The beggar Vijayarakṣa then spoke to the Blessed One the following verses:
“I do not look for praise. I do not seek to be respected by merchants. I want sublime wisdom, The unexcelled wisdom of awakening.

{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1683}} “Then I would reply, ‘You are poorer than I; I am not a pauper. You have never had faith. Since I do have faith, I will awaken.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1684}} “Awakening has no caste whatsoever. Neither does it have any fruition, nor life force. Rather, whoever bows to the mind of awakening Bows to this unexcelled vehicle.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1685}} “This mind of the supreme sage is the caste; This is the seed; this, the fruition. Having embarked upon the sacred and supreme vehicle, One is trained by the buddhas and becomes awakened.

{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1688}} The Blessed One then responded to the beggar Vijayarakṣa in verse:
“In this the Buddha is utterly unmistaken. This intention is unsurpassed. Today you have abandoned that previous idea, So you too will become a victorious one, a lord of Dharma.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1690}} Having heard the Thus-Gone One’s words, He was ecstatic beyond measure— Vijayarakṣa had faith in them And ascended in the sky to a height of seven palm trees.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1691}} At that moment the best among beings showed a smile. Multiple exquisite blue and yellow colored lights Issued forth from the Victorious One’s mouth And dissolved into his own crown.

People like them, Śāradvatī­putra, are unwholesome. Śāradvatī­putra, those fools have set out on the wrong path. They have not set out to benefit themselves or to benefit others. Such inappropriate ones incur eight types of destruction. These eight types of destruction are: the destruction of relations, the destruction of place, the destruction of enjoyments, the destruction by fire, the destruction by royal authority, {{page:{number:352,folio:F.177.a}}} the destruction of the sense fields, the destruction of the hells, and the destruction caused by the guardians of the hells.

These eight are: (1) incurring the unhappiness of birth in the hells; (2) incurring the unhappiness of birth in the animal realm; (3) incurring the unhappiness of birth in the world of Yama; (4) incurring the unhappiness where even though one is born among humans, one assumes birth in a peripheral region, (5) or one is blind, deaf, one-eyed, missing a finger or hand, paralyzed on one side, or afflicted with any severe form of illness; (6) incurring the unhappiness where even though one is born with a fortune equal to other humans, and although one is born in a suitable place, one mingles with crooked people, disgraceful people, uncouth people, women, dependents, nirgrantha followers or proponents of other non-Buddhist groups, or someone with wrong view, who always engages in evil deeds, has impure physical, verbal, and mental actions, and who cannot be changed for the sake of the noble ones; (7) and incurring the unhappiness where even though one is born among humans, a thus-gone one does not appear there, or (8) the night before a thus-gone one does appear one dies and does not encounter his direct presence. These are the eight intense types of unhappiness that they incur.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1743}} “Those who are born among hell beings have large and broad bodies, such that they will experience great torment. Those who are born among the animals, moreover, have large and broad bodies, and take huge bites, making it difficult to be nourished. {{page:{number:353,folio:F.177.b}}} Wherever one is born there, one will commit a great many evil deeds. Born there, one might be a fish, a crocodile, an otter, a porpoise, or a timi fish. Beings catch them with hooks and hold them up, and then in order to kill them, they cut them and beat them. Even having been violated in this way, it is not enough to kill them. Rather, their bodies grow back and although they experience many different kinds of painful sensations, they still will not die. Elsewhere in the animal realm, one might take birth as a camel, ox, donkey, chicken, or pig. If one becomes a camel or an ox, one’s nose will be pierced and one will be loaded down with cargo, struck repeatedly with sticks, and led around on journeys. Angry and dejected, one will be forced to carry cargo, without any protection whatsoever. When one becomes physically weak from being burdened by cargo, one will be shorn of life and one’s flesh will be eaten. Such animals are thus described as ‘broad-bodied, lazy, difficult to nourish, with big bites, and ineffectual.’

Śāradvatī­putra, in short, whoever sets out to interfere with a bodhisattva’s engendering of the mind of awakening, Śāradvatī­putra, will neither journey to nirvāṇa, nor have the excellent leisures.

{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1751}} Also at that time, the householder called Vijayarakṣa joined the assembly and took a seat. His wife, called Rūpavatī, was exquisite, beautiful, and pleasing to behold, with a fine complexion and perfect figure. The householder Vijayarakṣa , being especially attached to her, said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, please do not say that objects of sensual desire are receptacles of feces and urine. I say this because, Blessed One, my wife called Rūpavatī does not have any feces or urine.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1752}} Understanding the householder’s exalted intention, the Blessed One manifested a woman that looked exactly like the householder’s wife Rūpavatī. Seeing her, the householder thought, “Why has my wife come here?” As the apparent wife approached, he asked her, “Why have you come to this assembly?”
“Householder,” she replied, “I have come to the Thus-Gone One to listen to the Dharma.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1754}} The householder Vijayarakṣa then took his wife by the hand, wrapped her in the folds of his garment, and both the householder Vijayarakṣa and his wife Rupāvatī took their seat. The Blessed One then produced the miraculous feat of having the woman defecate in the folds of his garment. The householder Vijayarakṣa, {{page:{number:356,folio:F.179.a}}} unable to bear the stench of the feces, blocked his nose with his fingers and turned his face, looking around. To the right side of the householder Vijayarakṣa was the son of the Śākyas called Nanda, who asked the householder Vijayarakṣa , “Householder, why are you blocking your nose and turning away?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1755}} The householder Vijayarakṣa responded to Nanda, the son of the Śākyas, “Venerable, there is the stench of feces in this place. Do you not notice it too, just around here?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1756}} The Blessed One then performed a miraculous feat, which caused the son of the Śākyas Nanda and the fourfold retinue to clearly notice that the wife Rūpavatī had excreted feces in the folds of the garment. The son of the Śākyas Nanda then exclaimed to the householder Vijayarakṣa , “Look, householder! Your very own wife has defecated in the folds of your garment.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1757}} The householder Vijayarakṣa then turned to the son of the Śākyas called Vanadatta and said, “Vanadatta, I would look to see if my wife had excreted or urinated if I had some doubt about it. But how can I look when such a thing is impossible? Venerable one, this makes me think that perhaps you are the one who came carrying feces!”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1758}} At that the son of the Śākyas became so enraged that he rose from his seat and shouted at the householder Vijayarakṣa , “Householder, you are so attached that I will start calling you ‘Householder Feces’! Householder, did you not take your wife by her hand and wrap her in the folds of your own garment? Householder, was it not precisely that which created the present circumstance? See the source of the stench with your own eyes! Householder, since you are so attached {{page:{number:357,folio:F.179.b}}} and impertinent, I will give you the name ‘Householder Feces.’ As you sit there in feces, insulting others, you are no longer Vijayarakṣa . Householder, leave this retinue! Go away, householder! Vanish from this retinue, householder! Completely vanish, householder!”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1759}} The householder then took his wife by the hands and demanded of her, “Conniving woman, how could you even get the idea to defecate in the folds of my garment?”
“Householder,” she replied, “such things happen when one takes a receptacle of feces and wraps it into the folds of one’s own garment.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1761}} Dejected, the householder Vijayarakṣa considered tossing the feces to the ground, but he could not. Instead he proceeded to smear it all over his body, and then said to the son of the Śākyas Vanadatta, “Venerable, tell me, what is the best way now to be completely free of the stench of this feces?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1762}} “Householder, you will indeed be completely free of this and other things,” said Vanadatta. “However, it would be most appropriate now for you to leave this place. This is because, householder, you will die from the stench of feces that accompanies your wife.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1763}} The householder Vijayarakṣa said to the son of the Śākyas Vanadatta, “Venerable, mendicants are known as ‘compassionate.’ Mendicants are known as ‘loving.’ So, being a ‘son of the Śākyas,’ I wonder how much of a special being you are.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1764}} The son of the Śākyas Vanadatta replied to the householder Vijayarakṣa , “Why should I be compassionate toward you? And why should I be loving toward you? When the Thus-Gone One was teaching the Dharma, you disagreed with him, and said, ‘My wife has neither feces nor urine.’ And thereafter you insulted me too, did you not? Householder, you need to look with your own eyes to see whether or not your wife has feces or urine.” {{page:{number:358,folio:F.180.a}}}
The householder Vijayarakṣa then snapped at his wife, “Wife, you should go home!”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1766}} Having sent his wife away, Vijayarakṣa said to the Śākya youth Vanadatta, “Venerable, I see the faults of women. I see the untrustworthiness of women. Vanadatta, I wish to go forth from home to homelessness.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1767}} The son of the Śākyas Vanadatta then said to the householder Vijayarakṣa , “Householder, fumigate and soak your body with all kinds of fragrances for one hundred years! If you do that you will later succeed in going forth under the Blessed One. This is because, householder, your body has become foul-smelling from the stench of feces.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1768}} The householder Vijayarakṣa then said to the son of the Śākyas Vanadatta, “Venerable, whether I fumigate myself for one year or a hundred years, who knows if, while occupied with precisely that, I will die, or the Blessed One will pass away? On the other hand, venerable, if I do receive ordination from the Blessed One, I will not enter villages, towns, countries, or royal palaces. I will instead frequent the wilderness, beg for alms, and wear poor quality religious robes. Therefore, who will smell the foul stench of a forest-dwelling miscreant like me?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1769}} The Blessed One then said to the householder, “Householder, do you wish to go forth from home to homelessness?”
“I do wish to, Blessed One,” he replied.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1770}} The Blessed One said, “Monk, come join me, and live the holy life!” Once the householder, just at these words, had gone forth, he was dressed in ochre robes and his head was shaven as if seven days had passed, and he had an alms bowl in the palms of his hands.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1771}} The Blessed One then taught him the Dharma, {{page:{number:359,folio:F.180.b}}} teaching the noble truth of suffering, and, likewise, the noble truths of its origin, its cessation, and the path. Right away the monk gained the stainless and immaculate Dharma eye that sees phenomena. He had acquired the vocation, so the next morning he set out for the city of Rājagṛha wearing religious robes and carrying an alms bowl. While moving in rounds throughout the city of Rājagṛha for alms, he reached his own home and sat silently to one side for alms. His wife Rūpavatī saw that it was him, the householder Vijayarakṣa , who had taken ordination and come for alms wearing religious robes and carrying an alms bowl. She said, “Householder, you have acted inappropriately.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1773}} “Do you understand that you excreted and urinated in the folds of my garment and thus left my entire body with a foul stench?” replied the monk Vijayarakṣa.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1774}} “Householder,” she said, “this thing that you are criticizing me for did not happen to you. Householder, I was forced by my father to follow him between our homes, and do not recall even showing my face outside of any door, let alone going to see the Blessed One at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1775}} “I have as witnesses the Blessed One, the son of the Śākyas Vanadatta, and the fourfold assembly,” said Vijayarakṣa . “Do you not recall that you and I were apprehended by the son of the Śākyas Vanadatta and exiled from the assembly?”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1776}} Then Māra, the evil one, sat down behind the householder and said, “Householder, this is not why you were exiled and caused to wander. It was due to a magical apparition. Monk, you should enjoy the five sense pleasures! Householder, you were deceived by the mendicant Gautama. He has allowed many monks to go forth and thus caused them to wander.” {{page:{number:360,folio:F.181.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1777}} “So, the reason I was made to smell foul was because of a magical apparition?” asked the monk Vijayarakṣa.
“Indeed,” he replied.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1779}} “Then you are also a magical apparition,” said Vijayarakṣa . “And I too am a magical apparition. And all the teachings taught by the Thus-Gone One are also like a magical apparition.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1780}} At that point the woman purified the stainless and immaculate Dharma eye that sees phenomena. Having gained devotion and acquired conviction, she said, “Be happy, monk! Live the holy life! I will likewise go forth under the teaching of the Blessed One.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1782}} Based on precisely that true perspective regarding phenomena, the Blessed One said to the venerable Śāradvatī­putra, “Śāradvatī­putra, there are four qualities that bodhisattva great beings who want to fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood should abandon. What are these four? Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings should abandon evil companions. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings should abandon association with women. Bodhisattva great beings should abandon the speech of nirgranthas and the spells of materialists. And, Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings should abandon the degeneration of wrong view. Śāradvatī­putra, these four qualities should be abandoned by bodhisattva great beings. Śāradvatī­putra, I have never seen other qualities that create obstacles exactly as these four do.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1783}} “Śāradvatī­putra, it is for this reason that those who have entered the Great Vehicle should abandon these four things. Having abandoned them, whoever wishes to fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood {{page:{number:361,folio:F.181.b}}} should then rely upon, cultivate, and develop four other things. What are these four? Śāradvatī­putra, they should rely upon, cultivate, and develop a relationship with a spiritual friend—either a buddha, bodhisattva, or hearer—who instructs upon and teaches the Dharma discourses of the Bodhisattva Collection. Śāradvatī­putra, moreover, in order to avoid association with women, bodhisattvas should rely upon, revere, and serve those who are renounced, those who have gone forth, and those who dwell in the forest. Śāradvatī­putra, moreover, in order to avoid materialists and the speech of nirgranthas, bodhisattvas should engage in the practice of receiving, mastering, and memorizing the teachings. Śāradvatī­putra, moreover, in order to avoid wrong view, bodhisattvas should rely upon and cultivate the correct view of great emptiness.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1784}} Once the Blissful One had thus spoken, the Teacher also imparted the following instructions:

These four are as follows: Śāradvatī­putra, when the awakening of buddhas is in decline and the sublime Dharma is disappearing, bodhisattvas will make efforts to pursue the sublime Dharma. When thus-gone ones’ memorials are delapidated, bodhisattvas will restore them and, even as they discard their bodies and lives, they will not discard the Dharma. When seeing beings suffering, it evokes compassion. To have developed compassion causes them to strengthen their efforts further, thus eliciting the thought, ‘Once I have accomplished the wisdom of awakening, I will teach the Dharma to quell all the suffering of those beings.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1833}} “Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas are not content when pursuing the Dharma. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings have a greater inspiration to pursue the Dharma. Śāradvatī­putra, because of their grasp of the Great Vehicle, bodhisattva great beings are unparalleled. Śāradvatī­putra, because of their wish to benefit beings, bodhisattva great beings lovingly think, ‘They have no other protector at all, so it all comes down to me alone.’ Śāradvatī­putra, since they have the attitude of adhering to great compassion, bodhisattva great beings have no anger. Śāradvatī­putra, because of their accomplishment of wisdom on behalf of all beings, bodhisattvas have no jealousy. Śāradvatī­putra, because of benefiting all beings through the gift of Dharma, bodhisattvas have no miserliness. {{page:{number:367,folio:F.184.b}}} Śāradvatī­putra, to demonstrate their altruism, bodhisattvas give away all their possessions. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas have no clinging to any phenomenon.

You are welcome!’ Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas have no agitation, and when seeing beings suffering, they act compassionately and consistently exert effort. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas delight in the qualities of the buddhas. Śāradvatī­putra, since they proclaim the lion’s roar, bodhisattvas are not afraid. Śāradvatī­putra, since they are grounded in the qualities of the buddhas, bodhisattva great beings are not timid. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas make efforts to pursue the qualities of the buddhas. Śāradvatī­putra, to constantly make effort and teach the Dharma, bodhisattvas course throughout the trichiliocosm. Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattvas have come to an understanding of all phenomena, they are guardians of the victorious. Śāradvatī­putra, due to their discernment of all phenomena, exactly as they are, bodhisattvas uphold their essence. Śāradvatī­putra, since they understand all phenomena, bodhisattvas on their own have extracted their essence. Śāradvatī­putra, out of their ability to mature beings in timely and untimely ways, bodhisattvas provide encouragement. Śāradvatī­putra, since they are in harmony with the Dharma, bodhisattvas defeat those who argue against them. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings ascertain the meaning of all phenomena. {{page:{number:368,folio:F.185.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1835}} “Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings are of the caste of the qualities of the buddhas. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas are the great treasure of the great jewel of the Dharma. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings are the ocean of the Dharma, which opens out into the realization of the seal of all phenomena. Śāradvatī­putra, because they avert immeasurable, innumerable disturbances, bodhisattva great beings are like the Cakravāḍa and Mahācakravāḍa mountain ranges. Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings perfectly teach the Dharma without end, they are never finished. Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings have minds equal to the sky, they are stainless. Śāradvatī­putra, just as the sky is inexhaustible, bodhisattva great beings do not know exhaustion. Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings are exalted in terms of virtuous qualities, they are like a mountain. Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings are free of wanting and not wanting, they are like the earth. Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings do not squander roots of virtue, they are like a field. Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings fully reveal the light of Dharma, they are like the sun. Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings dispel darkness, they are like the moon. Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings quell the torment of desire, anger, and delusion, they are like a parasol. Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings are the shelter, refuge, and teacher of beings, they are like the shade of a large tree. Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings {{page:{number:369,folio:F.185.b}}} are adept in all the fields of artistry, they are like a teacher. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings derive their sustenance from fulfilling the intentions of all beings. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings are the teachers of all beings. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings are the support of all beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1837}} Śāradvatī­putra, imagine if all beings knew, as I do, how bodhisattvas abide by such actions on their behalf. Śāradvatī­putra, suppose that all beings then were to give bodhisattvas all their happiness, love, and joy, while carrying the bodhisattvas on their shoulders or heads from the time when bodhisattvas first give rise to the mind of awakening up until when they sit down at the seat of awakening. And suppose that once bodhisattvas reach the seat of awakening, all beings were to lay out a single carpet of precious fabric extending from the earth to the peak of existence, and with the thought, ‘How terrible if the bodhisattva’s body were to get too hot,’ they were also to have parasols of divine materials held up all around covering them. Suppose, moreover, that all beings were also to worship, revere, and honor them with flowers, incense, garlands, and unguents. Śāradvatī­putra, even respecting, honoring, and worshiping the bodhisattva great beings by performing such actions on their behalf would not be able to repay them. This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, these pleasures do not approach even one hundredth of the assistance provided by bodhisattvas as they furnish all beings with the pleasure of freedom from torment—no comparison whatsoever would suffice. This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, everything provided by beings is impermanent, mundane, {{page:{number:370,folio:F.186.a}}} associated with the aggregates, defiled, and mutable; whereas, Śāradvatī­putra, the happiness provided by bodhisattvas is undefiled, supramundane, trustworthy, devoid of intrinsic nature, and emptiness. Śāradvatī­putra, this is why beings cannot benefit bodhisattvas with any of the pleasures in their possession. Śāradvatī­putra, this is because bodhisattvas are those who awaken all slumbering beings. They are the circumspect for careless beings. They are the sane for insane beings. Śāradvatī­putra, they are the eyes for blind beings. They are their guides. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings are the medicine for beings afflicted with disease. They show the way to those who have embarked on the wrong path. They show the correct way to those who have strayed. Bodhisattvas inspire those who have not engendered roots of virtue to do so. Bodhisattvas inspire those who have not engendered wholesome qualities to do so. Thus, Śāradvatī­putra, in short, beings have no protection, refuge, or savior except for thus-gone ones and bodhisattvas, for, Śāradvatī­putra, the Buddha too has emerged from bodhisattvas.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1838}} The venerable Śāradvatī­putra then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, the vehicle of bodhisattva great beings is indeed so wonderful. Moreover, it is amazing how much it beautifies themselves as well as others. Blessed One, to give a simile, it is like a pāriyātra tree whose branches are all covered with flowers in full bloom beautifying itself and others too. {{page:{number:371,folio:F.186.b}}} Likewise, Blessed One, bodhisattvas fully replete with the qualities of the buddhas beautify themselves and immeasurably many beings. To give another simile, Blessed One, it is like the pāriyātra tree causing the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three to dance, play, and frolic. Likewise, Blessed One, bodhisattva great beings, once they fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, are replete with the qualities of the buddhas. In this way, while beautifying themselves, they also cause immeasurable, innumerable beings to journey there too. Beings who have reached there, moreover, also play, frolic, and take pleasure in the masteries, powers, branches of awakening, concentrations, liberations , absorptions, and attainments. This being the case, Blessed One, who, except for lazy ones like us that fall under the sway of others, would not adhere to that vehicle? Who would not long for it? Blessed One, we are encouraged and pleased to be given and taught another teaching. For otherwise, Blessed One, in the future we would lack the power by which we could at some point impact any being based on what we have heard from the Blessed One. {{note:{index:72,id:UT22084-048-001-1839}}} Blessed One, if we were henceforth to teach anyone, we would start with the Bodhisattva Vehicle at the very beginning and later teach the Hearer Vehicle. This is because, Blessed One, if we were to establish any being in awakening by encouraging them to swiftly awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, we would be returning the favor that the Thus-Gone One has done for us.” {{page:{number:372,folio:F.187.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1840}} The Blessed One answered the venerable Śāradvatī­putra as follows: “Śāradvatī­putra, excellent! It is excellent that you have donned strong armor to delight the bodhisattva great beings. This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, there will be a period and a time when not even the name of such a vehicle will exist, and when, Śāradvatī­putra, such a vehicle will be ridiculed and reviled, and such sūtras will not be upheld, but discarded. Śāradvatī­putra, noble sons or daughters who desire the meaning should then rely upon the meaning, rely upon the Dharma, and not dwell in crowded places. This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, the assembly at that time will be inappropriate, whereas, Śāradvatī­putra, my appropriate hearers will not discard, revile, or disregard such sūtras. For, Śāradvatī­putra, such acts are inappropriate. And that is because, Śāradvatī­putra, such childish acts are not appropriate acts, not the acts of the wise, whereas I, Śāradvatī­putra, perform wise acts, not childish acts.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1841}} “Śāradvatī­putra, my hearers should train as follows: Śāradvatī­putra, in the future, whoever appears with devotion, learning, diligence, mindfulness, and propriety, who searches for what is virtuous, is interested in the Dharma, and makes great efforts to pursue the Dharma, will also be ridiculed and disparaged. It will be charged, ‘They are lazy. They cannot attain the result. They indulge in pleasure. They want to indulge in pleasure. Those so-called “bodhisattvas” consume what was offered out of devotion. And even though they constantly preach that vehicle, the Thus-Gone One has not taught that they are coherent and fluent speakers.’ {{note:{index:73,id:UT22084-048-001-1842}}} {{page:{number:373,folio:F.187.b}}} Śāradvatī­putra, fools will also insult me with all manner of such divisive words, and charge that those whom the Thus-Gone One has taught to be supremely coherent and supremely fluent speakers are in fact not coherent and fluent.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1843}} “Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, those who dwell in households will be tormented, and thus come to believe that they should have faith in those fools. I can assure you that they will disparage bodhisattva great beings who uphold such sūtras even though they see them. Śāradvatī­putra, the Thus-Gone One has taught, ‘You should not harm, violate, or disparage anyone whether they are right or wrong.’ Nevertheless, they still speak to others in this way, and act in this way to me too. Just consider what will become of the collected teachings on discipline due to those fools. Śāradvatī­putra, they will conceive of what is Dharma as not Dharma, and what is not Dharma as Dharma. They will conceive of what is not discipline as discipline, and discipline as what is not discipline. They will conceive of what is suitable as what is not suitable, and what is not suitable as what is suitable. They will conceive of what is free as not free, and what is not free as free. Consider, Śāradvatī­putra, how they will be in error for as long as they neither understand discipline, nor fathom the depths of the Teacher’s teaching.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1844}} “Śāradvatī­putra, those beings will be overwhelmed by hostility, anger, and jealousy. They will also be overwhelmed by pride. Since they praise themselves and criticize others they will be racked with jealousy and miserliness. They will be filled with non-virtuous qualities and distant from all virtuous qualities, making them irredeemable. Śāradvatī­putra, those beings are to be abandoned. {{page:{number:374,folio:F.188.a}}} Śāradvatī­putra, I am the teacher to those with shame; I am not the one for the shameless. Śāradvatī­putra, I am the teacher to the mindful, not the forgetful. Śāradvatī­putra, I am the teacher to the insightful, not the foolish. Śāradvatī­putra, my hearers are not those who will contravene and go against the nature respected by the thus-gone ones. For this is the reality that the thus-gone ones have trained in for a long time, the very nature of a great being, which they attained through their training. This is also the same reality that bodhisattva great beings must accomplish in order to fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. And it is also each of the wisdoms that bodhisattvas are equipped with to free immeasurably many beings from the web of afflictions. I am not their teacher, because, Śāradvatī­putra, they are no good, no good. Śāradvatī­putra, that is all I can say about them.

Keep the Dharma, and nothing else, as your refuge. This is what you have been taught. Śāradvatī­putra, how do monks come to dwell in a place with Dharma, and not elsewhere? How are they their own refuge, and not someone else? How are they, and no other, their own protector? Well, Śāradvatī­putra, monks are to cultivate the applications of mindfulness and dwell free of desire. Through abandoning it they are transformed. And what, Śāradvatī­putra, is the application of mindfulness? The application of mindfulness regarding the absence of entity, absence of nature, and absence of characteristics is seeing phenomena exactly as they are. {{page:{number:375,folio:F.188.b}}} Śāradvatī­putra, this is how mindfulness is applied by means of the absence of entity and the absence of nature. Śāradvatī­putra, whoever is undeceived in this regard is called a place with Dharma, a Dharma refuge, a protector of oneself, a refuge of oneself. Śāradvatī­putra, those who cultivate such an application of mindfulness are called worthy ones free of all expression , who have exhausted the defilements , and are free of afflictions, objects of generosity, tranquil, gentle, divested of faults , and brahmins who have reached the other shore of pure conduct and arrived on dry land.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1846}} “So why, Śāradvatī­putra, are they called worthy ones ? Śāradvatī­putra, they are worthy in all virtues. Through virtuous actions they are free of all formations and they have cut the chain of all formations. Being divested of all formations, Śāradvatī­putra, worthy ones have exhausted the defilements, and thereby lack the basis and circumstance for formations even to form merit, let alone non-merit. This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, as the worthy ones have exhausted defilements, they have interrupted craving. Śāradvatī­putra, as the worthy ones have exhausted defilements, they have escaped from all fetters and are free of all phenomena, unsullied by any phenomenon, devoid of mental attachment, unattached to the desire realm, unattached to the form realm, unattached to the formless realm, free of longing, free of craving, and free of hostility.

Śāradvatī­putra, having exhausted all their defilements, they attain exhaustion with respect to all phenomena. By having thus attained exhaustion, they are said to have exhausted the defilements . Why, then, are they said to be free of afflictions ? Since all things are emptiness, they are neither afflicted, nor purified. {{page:{number:376,folio:F.189.a}}} Thus being pristine and utterly unsullied by what is desired or undesired, pleasant or unpleasant, or compounded or uncompounded, they are unsullied. Thus, Śāradvatī­putra, since worthy ones having exhausted the defilements means that they have abandoned all conceptual constructs, they are said to be free of afflictions.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1848}} “Why is it also that worthy ones are said to have exhausted the defilements ? They have abandoned torment and complete misery. Since they have completely quelled torment and grant the gift of the supreme Dharma free from worldliness, they are thus called objects of generosity . Why are they called masters ?

They have perfected the sublime truth regarding all these void phenomena and expelled {{note:{index:74,id:UT22084-048-001-1849}}} those with incorrect speech. Thus, they are called masters . Why are they called brahmins ? This is because they have removed, discarded, and uprooted all phenomena. Being unsullied by these phenomena, they are thus divested of wicked deeds.

Why are they called those who have reached the other shore ? Śāradvatī­putra, having vanquished Māra and all the afflictions associated with the faction of Māra, they have crossed over all phenomena, reaching the other shore to arrive on dry land.

{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-1852}} “Śāradvatī­putra, worthy ones who have exhausted the defilements have nothing to guard. Śāradvatī­putra, worthy ones who have exhausted the defilements have nothing to guard whatsoever, for their faculties are well guarded and they have attained the level of certainty. This is because they are lamps of the Dharma, they are protectors of the Dharma, they are lamps for themselves, they are protectors of themselves. It is for this reason, Śāradvatī­putra, that monks who abide in this way should be known as worthy ones. That is, as long as they do not discard the thus-gone ones’ awakening, or perform inappropriate acts, or perform any wicked deeds related to skillful practitioners of pure conduct, but rather set out to ensure that awakening is guarded, not violated, and not abandoned, but remains for a long time.

However, Śāradvatī­putra, in the future there will appear monks overwhelmed by audacity. They will be convinced that they have become free of afflictions through mere concentration, mere wearing of the right clothes, and mere dwelling in the forest, and thus develop conceit. Therefore, at that time, most devout brahmins and householders and most of those with trust will also be convinced, thinking, ‘Those worthy ones are objects of generosity. They have exhausted the defilements,’ and thus believe that they should treat those monks as special. Overwhelmed in this way by honor, gain, praise, fame, and renown, those foolish monks will be convinced of their own wisdom, thinking, ‘We have those qualities. We possess those qualities. We have exhausted the defilements. We have no afflictions.’ Thus, while thinking of themselves as wise beings, they will in fact be immature beings. They will have meager comportment. The comportment of those that dwell in villages will change. The comportment of those that dwell in temples will change. The comportment of those that dwell in the forest will change. The comportment of those that dwell in the assembly will change. Their performance of physical and verbal actions will go unguarded. {{page:{number:379,folio:F.190.b}}} They will develop the notion that they have no afflictions.

They will instruct each other, saying, ‘This is not the speech of the Buddha. This is not the teaching of the Teacher.’ Why will they say that? It is because they will be at odds with the Dharma, Dharma discipline, and discipline. So, believing that it is not the Dharma, they will call Dharma, non-Dharma; non-Dharma, Dharma; and non-discipline, discipline. Śāradvatī­putra, they will thus speak unflatteringly about the very Dharma that they receive, and then praise themselves and disparage others. Under the sway of pride in mere discipline, mere dwelling in the forest, mere concentration, mere wearing of the right clothes, mere study, mere learning, mere possession of an assembly, mere praise, mere flattery, mere gain, mere respect, mere fame, and mere renown, they will be destroyed by the pride of self-conceit.

Furthermore, Śāradvatī­putra, noble sons and daughters who follow the proponents of the nirgranthas, or who apply the spells of the materialists, may be respected by many people, and that being the case, they do not consider the qualities of the buddhas and so are made to abandon them.

What are those four qualities? Ānanda, bodhisattvas apply effort to pursue such qualities. Once they have found them, they also become accomplished in those qualities. Adhering to them themselves, they also lead many other beings to uphold the same qualities. Leading them to uphold them, they also delight them with Dharma discourses and thus encourage them.”

Ānanda, what makes bodhisattvas regress from the Dharma? It is the following: Although they teach the Dharma about profound emptiness, they may teach based on alms, bedding, seating, medicine, and utensils, such that they are given material objects first and then teach. In that case, although others are indeed taught the Dharma, this has in no way been engaged in properly. Thus, Ānanda, do bodhisattvas regress from the Dharma.”

They do not maintain anything deemed to be faulty. They pursue the Dharma according to the Dharma. They pursue the Dharma with the intention of engaging in the Dharma. Ānanda, how do bodhisattvas pursue the Dharma according to the Dharma?

Likewise, Ānanda, wherever the assembly of great lions resides, Ānanda, no others—such as Māra, the gods from the realm of Māra, or any other beings under Māra’s spell—can settle.

Likewise, Ānanda, unruly bodhisattvas with poor conduct, who chase after renown, fame, and praise, and who revere the name, cadence, and sound of ‘self,’ will flee, frightened and scared, and thus fall off steep cliffs.

{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2275}} “Therefore, Dṛḍhamati, with that in mind you should understand the following: Dṛḍhamati, countless eons ago there appeared in the world a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha called Jewel of Exalted Light. That thus-gone one’s lifespan was half an eon. That blessed one had a retinue of seven hundred million worthy ones who had exhausted the defilements. Together with them he would wander the countryside and observe the summer rains retreats. Dṛḍhamati, at that time that Jambudvīpa was broad and vast, {{page:{number:425,folio:F.214.b}}} extending across seven billion leagues. There was a universal monarch then called Lord of Irreproachable Merit. He was a coronated king of royal caste, who as a righteous Dharma king with sovereignty over the world of the four continents guarded his dominion over the four borders. The Jambudvīpa of that time had eight hundred million large and vast cities, which were each forty by thirty leagues in size. They were all wealthy, healthy, happy, abundant in food, pleasant, and well populated.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2276}} “Dṛḍhamati, at the center of King Lord of Irreproachable Merit’s Jambudvīpa was a huge royal palace where the king resided. The palace was eighty leagues in circumference and checkered in design, with each square a half league in width. Dṛḍhamati, that royal palace was called Sukhāvatī . The royal palace had seventy thousand surrounding gardens that were without owner or proprietor so that beings could enjoy them. Dṛḍhamati, there was one large garden that was as big as King Lord of Irreproachable Merit’s eighty-league royal palace. That large garden was surrounded all around by seven rows of palm trees, seven layers of lattices with tiny bells, seven layers of courtyards, seven walls, and seven moats.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2277}} “Dṛḍhamati, at that time the thus-gone one Jewel of Exalted Light gradually wandered through the area with his large monastic assembly comprised of seven hundred million worthy ones, and eventually they arrived at the royal palace. Dṛḍhamati, King Lord of Irreproachable Merit heard that the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Jewel of Exalted Light had been wandering through the land with his seven hundred million monks {{page:{number:426,folio:F.215.a}}} and that they had now arrived at the royal palace and taken up residence in the garden of the royal palace. So, Dṛḍhamati, the king went before the thus-gone one Jewel of Exalted Light, prostrated to the Blessed One’s feet, and sat to one side. Dṛḍhamati, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Jewel of Exalted Light understood the king’s intention and so he fully taught him a Dharma discourse of the Bodhisattva Collection, which resolves the doubts of all beings. Upon hearing it, the king experienced joy and happiness and became elated and enraptured, so that he thought to himself, ‘I should most certainly offer my own exquisitely adorned garden for the thus-gone one Jewel of Exalted Light to enjoy.’ With this thought, the king offered the garden for the Thus-Gone One to enjoy. The king also commissioned seven hundred million rest houses, seven hundred million promenades, and seven hundred million seats. Having also offered seven hundred million parks, together with attendants, he went before the Blessed One and asked, ‘Out of loving kindness for me, will the Blessed One please deign to come for a meal tomorrow with the assembly of monks?’

Carrying his alms bowl, and escorted by the assembly of monks, he went to the palace of King Lord of Irreproachable Merit. Arriving, he sat down on the cushion set out for him. The monks too sat down on their cushions as arranged. Understanding that the Blessed One was seated and that the assembly of monks too were seated, the king respectfully served the meal of abundant delicacies with his own hands, thus satisfying everyone. When he had respectfully served and satisfied the Blessed One with that meal served by his own hands, the king noticed that the Blessed One had finished eating and that his hands and bowl were now hidden.

This is because, Dṛḍhamati, the king called Lord of Irreproachable Merit was none other than you. Dṛḍhamati, I remember that in the past there were a full thousand buddhas whom you provided with unexcelled service and attendance in order to ask about this Dharma discourse. Dṛḍhamati, I will now teach you regarding your questions on how to accomplish the gateway of Dharma, and how the gateway of Dharma is accomplished.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2283}} “Dṛḍhamati, the gateways of Dharma are bases and foundations, but they are devoid of thinking, devoid of characteristics, devoid of effort, pure, completely pure, utterly pure, inexpressible, devoid of syllables, the inverse of syllables, and undemonstrable. Dṛḍhamati, phenomena neither appear, nor are they knowable by cognition. Dṛḍhamati, gateways of Dharma are the deeds by which the thus-gone ones fully understand nirvāṇa, for how they fully understand it, and the means by which they fully understand. They cannot be known by me. Dṛḍhamati, those phenomena are to be neither known nor designated. At the same time, Dṛḍhamati, all the designated paths are the gateways of Dharma. Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena are of the same flavor, they bear the seal of the ocean. Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena have the inexhaustible as their boundary and limit, their end is not known. Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena are neither completed nor diminished, they are an inexhaustibility. That is why the thus-gone ones designate, teach, and establish the accomplishment of the gateway beyond exhaustion.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2284}} “All phenomena possess the gate of a , for the entrance into a is a point of explanation for designating the gate devoid of attributes. {{page:{number:429,folio:F.216.b}}} Accomplishing it is to join with it. The syllables joined with it have not formed a . That is why the Dharma is called a . It is made known through a , and that knowledge, moreover, is made complete in conjunction with the syllables and words joined with it. Therefore, the thus-gone ones have taught that ‘all phenomena possess a as their gateway.’
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2285}} “What are the phenomena to which that gateway belongs? Dṛḍhamati, those phenomena are unformed. Since the unformed is unknown, they are known without being designated and known, expressed without being expressible, elucidated without being elucidatable, and exhausted without knowing exhaustion. Dṛḍhamati, thus does a perform the function of all phenomena. The gateway though which noble sons and daughters enter to gain wisdom and eloquence beyond exhaustion is the gateway called a.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2286}} “Dṛḍhamati, inexhaustible means beyond exhaustion. Dṛḍhamati, that which is devoid of designation and knowing is inexhaustible. Those that are made known without being known are not made known, and those that are designated are not designated—thus, Dṛḍhamati, is that gateway called inexhaustible.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2287}} “To what does that gateway belong? It is the gateway of those phenomena. Of which ones? Those that are neither found, nor perceived by the thus-gone ones.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2288}} “Dṛḍhamati, gateway means irreversible, for that entrance is into all phenomena. All that is elucidated is unelucidatable. All speech is speech of the inexhaustible. All speech is the speech of precisely that, and no other. All that is known is not known, and this, Dṛḍhamati, is a vajra statement. Why is it called a vajra statement ? Because it is never divisible, and being utterly indivisible, it is devoid of any agent. {{page:{number:430,folio:F.217.a}}} Thus lacking any agent whatsoever, it is called a vajra statement.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2289}} “All phenomena are devoid of action. Where there is no action there is also absolutely no maturation. Since they thus lack any maturation at all, all phenomena are therefore said to be devoid of action and devoid of maturation. Regarding the seal of the Dharma, when thus-gone ones teach the maturation of actions with respect to certain things, this is taught through the seal of the Dharma. That seal should be understood as unformed and undivided. Dṛḍhamati, noble sons and daughters who wish to engage in the maturation of actions should thus engage in it.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2290}} “Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena emerge in space, they are beyond coming and going. Dṛḍhamati, it is based on that gateway that thus-gone ones fully know the deaths and births of beings. Dṛḍhamati, noble sons and daughters who wish to penetrate death and birth should enter that seal. Dṛḍhamati, this is the seal of the absence of syllables and the absence of designation of any phenomena. Dṛḍhamati, the full range of everything verbally elucidated by the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas is elucidated by that seal and also elucidates that very same seal.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2291}} “Dṛḍhamati, all ordinary bodies are the awakened body of a thus-gone one. This is because that awakened body is the awakened body of ordinary bodies, and a thus-gone one demonstrates the formation of beings’ ordinary bodies by means of that seal. Dṛḍhamati, the seal by which the ordinary body is sealed is the designation of all ordinary bodies. Dṛḍhamati, everyone whose body is formed is sealed by that seal, and a thus-gone one has accomplished that very same seal.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2292}} “Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena have no entrance, they have no gateway. Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena have no going, they have no entrance. Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena have no entrance, they have no going. {{page:{number:431,folio:F.217.b}}}

Dṛḍhamati, the so-called unobstructed nature refers to the nature of the infinite. Since all beings are taught to be of that empty nature, they possess just such a nature.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2294}} “Dṛḍhamati, with that gateway of the nature being the gateway of all phenomena, everything that is the gateway of the nature comprises the aggregate of phenomena. However, the aggregate of phenomena also lacks an aggregate. With those aggregates thus lacking aggregates, those aggregates too are aggregates of phenomena. Dṛḍhamati, from whichever perspective the thus-gone ones teach the aggregates, they teach this topic through that threshold of the aggregate of phenomena. The aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness are without aggregates. This is taught as the gateway to the attributes of the aggregates.”

{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2298}} “Dṛḍhamati,” countered the Blessed One, “the thus-gone ones do not teach, designate, or posit in accordance with their complete understanding. This is because, Dṛḍhamati, while all phenomena are fully known by the wise, the knowledge of syllables accords with how the immature apprehend. {{page:{number:432,folio:F.218.a}}} Moreover, since those syllables are also devoid of syllables, there is no teaching.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2299}} The Blessed One then continued what he was saying to Dṛḍhamati: “Dṛḍhamati, all phenomena are the light of the orb of the sun. Dṛḍhamati, from whichever perspective phenomena are perfectly discerned, they appear to exclusively possess the nature of the infinite. It is in this sense that they are the light of the Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2300}} “Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena are fully illuminated and free of obstruction, they are luminous. Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena are unobstructed by anything whatsoever, they have no obstruction. Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena are like open space, they are unobstructed. Dṛḍhamati, the unobstructed vision of the thus-gone ones penetrates wherever there is dualistic designation and dualistic apprehending. Dṛḍhamati, this unobstructed perfect knowing, in which the thus-gone ones perfectly know all phenomena through their vision, is the Dharma of vision.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2301}} “Dṛḍhamati, through the gateway of all phenomena emerge expressions that cause noble sons to discern the meaning, expressions based on which they teach the profound, and expressions that are unimpeded. This is also the unobstructed gateway.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2303}} “Dṛḍhamati,” the Blessed One continued to explain to the bodhisattva Dṛḍhamati, “since all phenomena are without impediment and free of impediment, they are free of stains. Dṛḍhamati, being without benefit, all phenomena are devoid of being received. Dṛḍhamati, since no phenomenon can be apprehended as an object, all phenomena are infinite and boundless. Dṛḍhamati, wherever a teaching with syllables is taught, all that is taught there is that all phenomena are devoid of syllables. Dṛḍhamati, since all phenomena are without boundary and are taught to be without boundary, whenever someone enters the gateway beyond syllables, this is their entrance. That entrance is not an entrance into any phenomena whatsoever. {{page:{number:433,folio:F.218.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2304}} “Dṛḍhamati, the thus-gone ones have taught on the accomplishment of the gateway of absorption. What is the accomplishment of absorption? Dṛḍhamati, there is an absorption called array of all phenomena in a single mode . And there is an absorption called multiple array.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2305}} “What, then, is the absorption called the single array ? Dṛḍhamati, this is when bodhisattva great beings proclaim the name of a single thus-gone one by saying, ‘Such-and-such thus-gone one is teaching the Dharma in such-and-such world system.’ Hearing the name of that thus-gone one causes them to apprehend the thus-gone one in terms of his features, to aspire to such features themselves, and to actualize them. They bring to mind—with undistracted recollection, unperturbed faculties, and non-distracted attention—only the thus-gone one, either seated on the supreme seat of awakening, or fully awakening to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, or turning the wheel of Dharma, or surrounded by an assembly of hearers, or teaching the Dharma. By recollecting the name of that thus-gone one they bring before themselves the perception of his world system. Moreover, it also makes them understand their perception of the thus-gone one and his world system as exclusively perceived by way of non-apprehending. By adhering to that and not discarding that connection, the awakened body of a thus-gone one will be actualized. By bringing to mind the teaching of the Dharma, they also bring it before themselves by means of the profound, the lucid, meanings, and syllables, precisely how they are inclined toward it. Abiding in that absorption, they are motivated by the perishability of all things to listen to the Dharma taught by the thus-gone one. They are motivated to receive and uphold all those teachings that are taught. Having received and upheld them, they rise from that absorption and teach the fourfold retinue. That engagement and that perception are, in this vein, the accomplishment of the absorption of the single array. {{page:{number:434,folio:F.219.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2306}} “Furthermore, Dṛḍhamati, bodhisattvas also destroy that very perception and destroy their own body too. The perishability of all things inducts them into the absorption of the single array . Rising from that, they are also led to teach the Dharma to the fourfold retinue. Dṛḍhamati, this too is the accomplishment of the absorption of the single array.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2307}} “Furthermore, Dṛḍhamati, bodhisattvas are led to analyze that very perception of the thus-gone one’s awakened body by thinking, ‘Where did the thus-gone one’s awakened body come from, and where have I gone?’ Thus they understand perfectly that the thus-gone one has not arrived and that they themselves have not departed. They then think, ‘All phenomena are beyond coming and going.’ Through abiding by and striving in such analysis, they obtain before long the unobscured vision of Dharma. Upon obtaining the unobscured vision of Dharma, they are a thus-gone one, for they have actualized the gateway of Dharma through which unimpeded eloquence is obtained. They teach the Dharma, yet they do not truly see those phenomena.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2309}} “Dṛḍhamati, it is like this, for example: Even while a thus-gone one’s unimpeded wisdom partakes of the past, a thus-gone one’s wisdom also has no impediment with respect to bodies. A thus-gone one’s wisdom does not partake of the past by means of apprehending. Even though a thus-gone one’s wisdom does not partake of the past, the wisdom of a thus-gone one still masters the past. However, with respect to the past, it does not follow after any bodies as observed by a thus-gone one. The same also goes for the future and the present. Dṛḍhamati, it is in this manner that while abiding in the absorption of the single array , bodhisattvas teach the Dharma, although they do not even truly see those phenomena.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2310}} “Abiding in that absorption through having strongly cultivated it {{page:{number:435,folio:F.219.b}}} causes them to bring to mind, perceive, and manifest before themselves a second thus-gone one, either coming to reside in some world system and sitting down at the seat of awakening, or fully awakening to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, or turning the wheel of Dharma, or teaching the Dharma. They thus also receive and uphold the Dharma taught by that thus-gone one. While perceiving the previously perceived thus-gone one, they do not discard this perception of a second thus-gone one. They thus perceive and actualize both thus-gone ones teaching the Dharma. Dṛḍhamati, this too is the accomplishment of the absorption of the single array.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2311}} “Furthermore, Dṛḍhamati, once bodhisattvas have retained well and imagined well, to the point of great mastery, one perception of a thus-gone one, they can then bring to mind as many thus-gone ones as they wish. Dṛḍhamati, it is just like how a masterful monk can bring to mind the perception of the physical sense sources as being blue. He can imagine all of them, everything whatsoever, as only blue, such that no perception of them manifests in any other way apart from blue. He imagines and transforms all beings into only blue, manifesting them as only blue. He perceives all internal and external phenomena with the thought that they are blue and he also gains mastery in that. Dṛḍhamati, in the same way do bodhisattvas bring to mind the various world systems in which they have heard that myriad thus-gone ones reside, as well as the thus-gone ones {{note:{index:87,id:UT22084-048-001-2312}}} themselves.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2313}} “Through bringing to mind a perception of thus-gone ones that is well imagined and well ascertained, they transform all beings and name them ‘thus-gone ones, buddhas, self-arisen ones.’ {{page:{number:436,folio:F.220.a}}} By bringing to mind a mentally created perception of thus-gone ones, all perceptions are transformed by them into a single perception in which only thus-gone ones manifest. They do not see anything at all that is not perceived as thus-gone ones, or exclusively as buddhas. Dṛḍhamati, this too is the accomplishment of the absorption of the single array .”
“Blessed One, what is the accomplishment of that absorption?” asked Dṛḍhamati.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2315}} “It is that the one-pointed mental perception of all thus-gone ones is not discarded,” said the Blessed One. “That, Dṛḍhamati, is accomplishing the absorption of the single array . Dṛḍhamati, that all phenomena are understood with a single perception is also the nature of everything—this, Dṛḍhamati, is called the absorption of the single array . Bodhisattvas, while abiding in that absorption, think, ‘All speech is the speech of the thus-gone ones; all bodies are the bodies of the thus-gone ones.’ Such is their practice and belief.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2316}} “Moreover, Dṛḍhamati, bodhisattvas proclaim the names of two, three, four, five, ten—up to one hundred, and up to one hundred thousand—thus-gone ones, manifesting and bringing them all to mind simultaneously. They also manifest and bring to mind all the arrays of buddha realms and arrays of hearers belonging to those thus-gone ones. They also manifest, bring to mind, and bring forth the perfect forms, perfect characteristics, perfect complexions, perfect bodies, and perfect proportions belonging to those thus-gone ones. They apprehend the characteristics of each of the traits of a great being. They apprehend the characteristics of walking without delusion, having the gait of a lion, {{page:{number:437,folio:F.220.b}}} the invisible crown protuberance, and the full fathom of light enveloping him. They also transform that full fathom of light, imagining it to be infinite light. They perfectly cognize the infinity of light and apprehend an infinity of buddha realms. They also transform, bring to mind, and perfectly cognize immeasurable arrays of buddha realms, while they also fully comprehend, bring to mind, and transform an infinite array of hearers.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2317}} “Moreover, they analyze by thinking, ‘Where did the thus-gone ones come from, and where have I gone?’ Being immersed in this thought, they are brought to the belief that the thus-gone ones and they themselves are beyond coming or going. They then think, ‘There is no phenomenon whatsoever called thus-gone one and there is no phenomenon whatsoever called self .’ They continue to analyze, thinking, ‘All phenomena are the same.’ Through analyzing thus, they come to the belief that all phenomena are identical in characteristic. As they engage in, believe in, and perfectly understand the thought, ‘All phenomena are characterized by the characteristic of being unformed,’ they thus transform phenomena. They thus perceive all phenomena as having a single characteristic by way of being without characteristics.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2319}} “Dṛḍhamati, however many {{note:{index:88,id:UT22084-048-001-2320}}} buddhas are accomplished, the one-pointed state of mind remains, for, Dṛḍhamati, this is the accomplishment of the absorption of the single array . This accomplishment in which everything has the single characteristic of being buddhas, yet also has no characteristics, is known as the absorption of the single array . While abiding in that absorption, one does not have the thought, ‘This is not a thus-gone one.’ One does not have the thought, ‘This is not a phenomenon.’ One does not have the thought, ‘This is not a hearer.’ Nor does one perceive or think, ‘hearer.’ One does not have the thought, ‘The Dharma is not taught.’ {{page:{number:438,folio:F.221.a}}} Nor does one perceive the Dharma being taught. One does not have the thought, ‘This is not perceived,’ nor does one perceive perception. One does not have the thought, ‘It is not a buddha realm,’ nor does one perceive buddha realms. One does not have the thought, ‘It is not the retinue,’ nor does one perceive the retinue. One does not have the thought, ‘It is not eloquence,’ nor does one perceive eloquence. One does not have the thought, ‘This is not expression,’ nor does one perceive expression. One does not have the thought, ‘This is not transforming,’ nor does one perceive anything transformed. There is nothing at all that one does not believe, nor does one perceive any belief. There is no absence of thinking at all, nor does one perceive any thinking. There is no absence of cultivation at all, nor does one perceive cultivation. There is no absence of discernment at all, nor does one perceive discernment. There is no absence of clarification at all, nor does one perceive clarification. There is nothing at all that one does not teach, nor does one perceive teaching. Dṛḍhamati, this is called the accomplishment of the absorption of all phenomena seen by the unobstructed wisdom of bodhisattvas . The very absence of visual impediment is called unimpededness . That which perceives such phenomena is called the vision of Dharma . Absorption is that by which bodhisattvas attain infinite eloquence.”
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2321}} The bodhisattva great being Dṛḍhamati then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, in the future there will appear myriad bodhisattva great beings who enter attainment in that absorption, reach perfection through that absorption, and thereby also attain infinite eloquence.” {{page:{number:439,folio:F.221.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2322}} “Dṛḍhamati,” replied the Blessed One, “you should understand that, in the future, during the time of the final five hundred years, the bodhisattvas who have learned of that meditative absorption will reach perfection through that absorption and its limit will be the infinite eloquence of those monks. {{note:{index:89,id:UT22084-048-001-2323}}} Dṛḍhamati, regarding your statement, ‘There will appear myriad beings who will reach perfection through that absorption,’ Dṛḍhamati, those who cultivate that absorption, repeating it frequently without thinking about anything else, will reach perfection through that absorption and also attain infinite eloquence, attaining eight hundred thousand gateways of Dharma from the thus-gone one Akṣobhya in order to actualize that infinity of eloquence. Hence, Dṛḍhamati, these are expressions connected to one gateway. Dṛḍhamati, the gateways of Dharma in their entirety are expressions that distinguish between the levels. This is why, Dṛḍhamati, that gateway should by all means be comprehended. It should by all means be entered. It should by all means be cultivated. Explaining it based on its characteristics should be cultivated constantly. Apprehending it, moreover, should likewise be cultivated. This singular action is the body of the Buddha.
{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2324}} “The awakening of the buddhas is imagined by mind. Mind too is formless and pure by nature. Those who adhere extensively to apprehending Will engage in each and every apprehension.

Apply diligence to attain that absorption and do not discard your efforts. When seated, enthusiastically preaching day and night, manifest the thus-gone ones seated at the supreme seat of awakening, or turning the wheel of Dharma, and likewise have no stinginess with Dharma. While giving the gift of Dharma, transform yourself and the audience members for the Dharma into the bodies of thus-one ones; for while one’s own body will be destroyed, those bodies do not abide anywhere at all, and teach the Dharma while not abiding anywhere. One should sit on the cushion observing that, with that kind of experience, and effecting that kind of transformation, and while seated in this manner, one should give the gift of Dharma.

{{milestone:UT22084-048-001-2458}} This concludes the noble Great Vehicle sūtra “Upholding the Roots of Virtue.”
