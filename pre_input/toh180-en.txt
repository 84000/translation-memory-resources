{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-060-009-11}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was staying at Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha together with a great monastic assembly of five hundred monks. Also gathered there were twelve thousand bodhisattvas, including the bodhisattva great being Vyūha­pratimaṇḍita, the bodhisattva great being Siṃha­vikrānta­gāmin, the bodhisattva great being Anāvaraṇa­raśmi­nirdhauta­prabhā­tejo­rāśi, the bodhisattva great being Giri­śikhara­meru­svara­rāja, the bodhisattva great being Priya­prahasita­vimala­prabha, the bodhisattva great being Sūrya­candrābhibhūtārci, the bodhisattva great being Parama­vimala­paṭṭa­dhārin, the bodhisattva great being Niścarita­tejas­padma­praphullita­gātra, the bodhisattva great being Brahma­svara­nirghoṣa­svara, the bodhisattva great being Siṃha­rāja­gati­vikrīḍita­mati, the bodhisattva great being Kanakārci­śuddha­vimala­tejas, the bodhisattva great being Mṛdutaruṇa­sparśa­gātra, the bodhisattva great being Body That Expands Like a Golden Ornamented Victory Banner,{{note:{index:3,id:UT22084-060-009-12}}} the bodhisattva great being Daśa­raśmi­māra­bala­pramardin, the bodhisattva great being Śāntīndriyeryāpatha­praśānta­gāmin, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-060-009-508,folio:F.267.b}}} the bodhisattva great being Dharaṇīndharābhyudgata­rāja, the bodhisattva great being Singer of Divine Melodies, the bodhisattva great being Sarva­dharmeśvara­vaśa­vikrānta­gāmin, the bodhisattva great being Śrī­tejo­vimala­gātra, and the bodhisattva great being Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta.

{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-060-009-14}}}“Guide of boundless renown, please explain
How phenomena are without a life principle, personality, and self.
This supreme assembly, so sublime,

{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-060-009-36}}}The Blessed One expressed his approval to the bodhisattva great being Siṃha­vikrānta­gāmin, saying, “Noble son, excellent, excellent! It is astonishing that you ask such questions that all worldly beings find difficult to grasp. Noble son, this is certainly acceptable, but why do you ask? This is not a subject fit for beginning bodhisattvas who possess the views of emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, nonarising, the intangible, no attributes, buddhas, and awakening. Noble son, do not speak of this Dharma teaching in front of beginning bodhisattvas. 
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-060-009-37}}}“Why? Because this teaching will entirely interrupt their roots of virtue. It might cause them to regress from the awakening of the buddhas and fall into eternalism or nihilism. It is possible they will not understand what realization the thus-gone ones base their teachings on.”
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-060-009-38}}}The bodhisattva great being Siṃha­vikrānta­gāmin replied, “Blessed One, please explain this.

They will conceptualize everything as emptiness and signlessness, be fond of speech, be attached to expressions, believe syllables to be pure, be inclined to conversation, and cling fondly to elegant expressions and names.
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-060-009-39}}}“If these bodhisattvas hear the Thus-Gone One teaching the Dharma beyond letters or words, they will abandon these views and teach the Dharma according to whatever interests beings have. Then, trained in skillful means, they will speak of having few desires but will not realize purity through it. 
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-060-009-40}}}“They will speak of endeavoring in rituals but will not realize purity through it. They will speak of vows but will not realize purity because of them. They will criticize social obligations and become interested in complete disengagement from all phenomena. They will praise the delights of solitude where there are no social obligations but will not realize purity because of it. They will praise the mind of awakening and know the nature of the mind to be awakened.
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-060-009-41}}}“They will praise the extensive sūtra teachings and know all phenomena extensively. They will express the words of the bodhisattvas and will not regard hearers, solitary buddhas, and buddhas as different.
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-060-009-42}}}“They will praise generosity and realize the equality of generosity. They will praise discipline and realize natural discipline. They will praise patience and see the fact that all phenomena are exhausted, purified, and unborn. They will praise diligence {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-060-009-512,folio:F.269.b}}} and realize that no phenomenon requires seeking or effort. They will show how millions of gateways of concentration and equilibrium are accomplished, and will know all phenomena to be naturally settled in equipoise. They will offer a thousand kinds of praise to knowledge, and thereby realize the nature of knowledge and deficient knowledge. 
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-060-009-43}}}“They will reveal the faults of attachment and not see anything to be attached to. They will reveal the faults of aversion and not see anything to be averse to. They will reveal the faults of stupidity and be inspired to separate all phenomena from the obscuration of stupidity.
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-060-009-44}}}“They will teach beings the danger of passing into hell, the animal realm, and of realm of the lord of death, but they will not apprehend hell beings, the animal realm, or the realm of the lord of death. They will teach the Dharma that aligns with beings’ interests. There are those who are interested in the single principle of emptiness, and likewise there are those who are interested in the single principle of signlessness, wishlessness, nonarising, intangibility, and no attributes. Therefore, Blessed One, hearers, solitary buddhas, and bodhisattva great beings who have just entered this vehicle do not have a vocabulary for such skillful means. To remedy this, please provide a vocabulary for skillful means to those who are interested in the profound and in the single principle.”
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-060-009-45}}}Then the Blessed One said to the bodhisattva great being Siṃha­vikrānta­gāmin, “Noble son, listen well and bear what I say in mind. I will explain this topic to you.”
“Yes, Blessed One, I will.”

Noble son, consider what happened to the roots of virtue possessed by Devadatta. Noble son, Devadatta had thirty of the marks of a great person. He had such roots of virtue, but did not understand this Dharma principle, and so his roots of virtue expired and he was born in the great hell of Ceaseless Torment. Noble son, understand that the roots of virtue of those who have not fully assimilated this Dharma principle will expire, just as happened in his case.

He was a blessed buddha who was learned and virtuous, a sugata, a knower of the world, an unsurpassed being, a charioteer who guides beings, and a teacher of gods and humans. The lifespan of this thus-gone one was ninety-nine trillion years. His world was called Kanakārcis, {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-060-009-519,folio:F.273.a}}} as that buddha realm was made entirely of gold. All its beings were in the process of attaining nirvāṇa through the three vehicles of the hearers, solitary buddhas, and bodhisattvas.

They had exhausted the defilements, put down their burdens, attained benefit for themselves, and eliminated what bound them to existence. Their minds had been completely liberated by authentic teachings. The second assembly consisted of seventy trillion monks, the third of sixty trillion monks, and the fourth of fifty trillion, all of whom were worthy ones, had exhausted the defilements, had put down their burdens, had attained benefit for themselves, and had eliminated what bound them to existence. Their minds had been completely liberated by authentic teachings. There were twice as many nuns in the assembly, as well as twice as many laymen and laywomen. There were also twice as many bodhisattvas in the assembly, all of whom were irreversible beings, had gained acceptance that phenomena are unborn, were skilled in accomplishing the ways of absorption, and had attained the dhāraṇī of the boundless gateways. Given that this entire assembly was comprised of those who could turn the wheel of Dharma of irreversibility, what need is there to mention the assembly of those who had newly entered the Bodhisattva Vehicle? Also in that assembly were a limitless number of followers of the vehicle of the solitary buddhas.

The presence of these sounds liberated the minds of the beings living in that world. After that thus-gone one had passed completely beyond suffering, his sublime Dharma remained for a thousand years, after which those sounds stopped reverberating from the trees.

He had a great degree of pure discipline, had attained the five mundane superknowledges, and was well trained in the Vinaya. This monk engaged in intense austerities, was inclined toward frugality, and worked within the community. He built a monastery where he lived, and where everyone in the community was oriented to pure discipline and committed to the qualities of purification. This monk cultivated diligence and always maintained the mind of awakening. He inspired other bodhisattvas to live this way of life and to adopt views with a reference point. He caused them to accept that all karmic predispositions are impermanent, that all karmic predispositions are painful, and that all karmic predispositions lack a self.

Noble son, the Dharma teacher Viśuddha­cāritra traveled with his community to the monastery where Cāritramati lived and took up residence there. From that monastery they went on regular alms rounds to villages, motivated by compassion for beings, and then returned to the monastery. In this way, he caused hundreds of thousands of families to develop faith in them. Everyone in the community behaved skillfully. They would also travel to the villages and teach beings the Dharma, and even established many hundreds of thousands of animals in unsurpassed and perfect awakening.

For another sixty lifetimes he encountered unpleasant speech, and for thirty-two thousand lifetimes he had no access to the renunciant’s life. The residual traces of that karmic obscuration allowed him to become a renunciant during the time of the teachings of the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Expanding Stainless Light. As a renunciant he did not attain even a semblance of patience, even though he practiced for sixty trillion years as if his head were on fire, and for many hundreds of thousands of lives his faculties remained dull.

Mañjuśrī, immature, ordinary, unlearned beings do not know all phenomena to be utterly beyond suffering. They therefore conceptualize self and other, and thus accumulate physical, verbal, and mental karma. Because of these mistaken imputations, they think, ‘I am attached, I am angry, I am stupid.’ If they become renunciants under the teachings of the Thus-Gone One, they go on to think, ‘I am disciplined, I am chaste, I should transcend saṃsāra, {{page:{number:19,id:UT22084-060-009-525,folio:F.276.a}}} I should attain nirvāṇa, and I should gain freedom from suffering.’

They will think, ‘Actualizing phenomena is cessation.’ They will think, ‘I should cultivate the path, whatever it takes!’ They will go alone into solitude and focus on those practices, thus attaining tranquility. Their belief that they are weary and their attainment of tranquility will lead them to become disenchanted and disheartened with all phenomena.

I am a worthy one.’ Then when they reach the point of death and see that they will be reborn, they will become doubtful and suspicious of the Buddha’s awakening.
