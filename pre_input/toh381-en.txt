{{milestone:UT22084-079-008-50}} Thus have I heard at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in the bhagas of vajra queens , which are the essence of the body, speech, and mind of all tathāgatas. There, he noticed Vajragarbha in the midst of eight hundred million lords of yogins, and smiled. As the Blessed One smiled, Vajragarbha immediately rose from his seat, draped his robe over his shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. With palms joined, he spoke to the Blessed One. {1.1.1}
{{milestone:UT22084-079-008-8118}} “I would like to hear, O master of gnosis, about the secret foundation of all tantras, defined as their emergence from sampuṭa.” {1.1.2}
{{milestone:UT22084-079-008-52}} The Blessed One said:
“Ho Vajragarbha! Well done! Well done, O great compassionate one! Well done! Well done, O great bodhisattva! Well done! Well done, O receptacle of qualities! {1.1.3}
{{milestone:UT22084-079-008-53}} “You are asking all about that Which is secret in all the tantras.” {1.1.4}
{{milestone:UT22084-079-008-54}} Thereupon, these great bodhisattvas, With Vajragarbha as their leader, Asked questions according to their respective doubts With eyes wide open in great exhilaration. {1.1.5}
{{milestone:UT22084-079-008-55}} Bowing repeatedly, they asked, “What is meant by all the tantras? What would be their foundation? Why is this foundation described as secret ? {1.1.6}
{{milestone:UT22084-079-008-56}} “What is the emergence from sampuṭa? What would be its defining characteristic ?” {1.1.7}
{{milestone:UT22084-079-008-57}} The Blessed One replied, “These tantras are all the tantras . By the phrase all the tantras is meant the Guhyasamāja Tantra , and so forth. That which constitutes their foundation has been established—this is what is meant. Because this foundation is inaccessible to Viṣṇu, Śiva, Brahmā, hearers, and solitary buddhas, it is secret . This secret foundation is sampuṭa , whose nature is gnosis and skillful means. {{page:{number:2,folio:F.74.a}}} This (gnosis and means) itself is the emergence , which is the meditative absorption of sampuṭa—this is what is meant. {{note:{index:4,id:UT22084-079-008-58}}} Emergence means ‘arising.’ Such defines the intrinsic nature of all animate and inanimate things. {{note:{index:5,id:UT22084-079-008-59}}} Therefore it is their defining characteristic . {1.1.8}
{{milestone:UT22084-079-008-60}} “Alternatively, by the word sampuṭa {{note:{index:6,id:UT22084-079-008-61}}} —sampuṭa that is the foundation of all the tantras—Vajrasattva is meant. By the word secret is meant the secret character of encoding a mantra according to specified rules, of the empowerment ritual of the maṇḍala deities, and so forth. {1.1.9}
“Hear this tantra, explained by me, which has the nature of insight and means!
{{milestone:UT22084-079-008-63}} “First, one should meditate on emptiness And remove the impurities of embodied beings By considering their constituent element of form as empty. One should apply the same concept to sound, {1.1.10}
{{milestone:UT22084-079-008-64}} “And construe the constituent of sound as empty. One should apply the same concept to smell, And regard the constituent of smell as empty. One should apply the same [concept] to taste, {1.1.11}
{{milestone:UT22084-079-008-65}} “And construe the constituent of taste as empty. One should apply the same concept to tactility, And construe the constituent of tactility as empty. One should apply the same concept to mental objects.” {1.1.12}
{{milestone:UT22084-079-008-7022}} Vajragarbha said:

{{milestone:UT22084-079-008-7023}} The Blessed One said:
“Understand that the truth, just like the path, Is nondual—devoid of duality. It cannot be reasoned out or apprehended, And it is difficult to awaken to for intellectuals. {1.1.18}
{{milestone:UT22084-079-008-74}} “It is the secret of all buddhas, Equivalent to empty space. The hearers do not know it, Since they are enveloped by the darkness of ignorance. {1.1.19}

Otherwise, the practitioner should do this practice assiduously with a real consort .

Consequently, he should do the practice with the consort (mudrā) in secret, using secret substances, mantra, and tantric techniques, while keeping his samaya, following his prescribed conduct, and abiding in reality ( tattva ).
