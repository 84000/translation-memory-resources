{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-066-010-17}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was in the Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s park at Śrāvastī. He was residing there with a great saṅgha of five hundred monks, one hundred thousand bodhisattvas who had all donned the great armor, and the gods who inhabit the desire and form realms. There, the Blessed One, surrounded and revered by this retinue of hundreds of thousands of beings, taught the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-066-010-18}}}Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta raised a jeweled parasol measuring ten leagues in diameter as an offering to the Blessed One and held it above the Blessed One’s head. Within the retinue was a god from the Heaven of Joy named Śrībhadra whose progress toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening had become irreversible. Together with his attendants, he had joined the retinue and taken his seat. Now he rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Joining his palms, he bowed toward Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta and inquired of him, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-066-010-191,folio:F.61.b}}} “Mañjuśrī, have you still not had enough of making offerings to the Thus-Gone One?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-066-010-19}}}“Divine being, tell me,” Mañjuśrī asked in return, “is the ocean ever satiated by all of the water that it receives?” 
“No, Mañjuśrī, it is not,” replied the god.
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-066-010-21}}}Mañjuśrī then said, “Divine being, bodhisattvas seek boundless and immeasurable omniscient wisdom that is as difficult to fathom as the depths of the great ocean,{{note:{index:4,id:UT22084-066-010-22}}} so they can never have enough of making offerings to the Thus-Gone One.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-066-010-23}}}“Mañjuśrī, what should bodhisattvas focus on when they make offerings to the Thus-Gone One?” asked the god.
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-066-010-24}}}Mañjuśrī replied, “Divine being, there are four things that bodhisattvas should focus on when they make offerings to the Thus-Gone One. These four are omniscience, liberating all beings, ensuring that the lineage of the Three Jewels is not broken, and attaining the array of qualities of the buddhafield. Divine being, bodhisattvas should make offerings to the Thus-Gone One while focusing on those four things.”
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-066-010-25}}}“Mañjuśrī,” said the god, “when you were among the Brahmā realm gods you gave a Dharma teaching to Brahmā Śikhin called The Fourfold Accomplishment of the Bodhisattva Path. Mañjuśrī, would you please teach that? I and everyone in this assembly would like to hear it. Mañjuśrī, bodhisattvas are not stingy with the Dharma, nor are they tight-fisted with the Dharma as teachers.”
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-066-010-26}}}“Divine being,” Mañjuśrī replied, “in that case listen well, pay attention, and I will explain the Dharma teaching called The Fourfold Accomplishment to you.

Since he had become exceedingly happy, delighted, and joyful, he and his retinue showered the entire retinue with divine mandārava flowers as well as blue, pink, red, and white lotus flowers as an offering to Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta. As soon as they had scattered the flowers, through the power of the Buddha, beautiful, fragrant, and delightful lotus flowers the size of chariot wheels appeared in the sky above them.

However, it would be impossible to determine the number of these bodhisattvas by counting them, because the bodhisattvas that have gathered here are that innumerable.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.73,id:UT22084-066-010-98}}}“Blessed One, how can there be that many buddhafields in which these bodhisattvas will fully awaken to buddhahood?” asked Śāriputra.
{{milestone:{label:1.74,id:UT22084-066-010-99}}}“Silence, Śāriputra, do not say that,” replied the Blessed One. “Śāriputra, the thus-gone ones empty countless buddhafields. Consider this, Śāriputra: The lifespan of the thus-gone ones lasts for as many eons as there are grains of sand in the Ganges. Each and every day each one delivers as many Dharma teachings as there are grains of sand in the Ganges, and in all of those Dharma teachings he prophesies as many bodhisattvas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges. Even if one were to identify a single bodhisattva to the east, beyond as many buddhafields as there are grains of sand in the Ganges, the thus-gone one will empty that many buddhafields.{{note:{index:10,id:UT22084-066-010-100}}} Therefore, it goes without saying that the thus-gone ones, who know the minds of all beings born into the buddhafields of the ten directions, whom they perceive with the ordinary, corporeal eye of a thus-gone one, will empty all those buddhafields.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.75,id:UT22084-066-010-101}}}At that point the great hearers and the entire retinue were amazed and exclaimed, “Our teachers have such vast magical powers, are so mighty, and have such great supreme knowledge! We are so fortunate!”

{{milestone:{label:1.77,id:UT22084-066-010-103}}}At that point the god Śrībhadra said to Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta, “Mañjuśrī, you performed these deeds and ripened countless beings for awakening—well done! Mañjuśrī, please grace us with your eloquence, beginning with the teachings that ripen the awakening of bodhisattvas.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.78,id:UT22084-066-010-104}}}“Divine being,” replied Mañjuśrī, “there are thirty-five teachings that ripen the awakening of bodhisattvas. The thirty-five teachings are these: urging them toward timeliness; urging them toward moderation; urging them toward proportion; urging them toward capacity; urging them toward stability; urging them toward the perfections; urging them toward method; urging them toward the altruistic intention; urging them toward great love; urging them toward great compassion; urging them toward the Great Vehicle; urging them toward the Lesser Vehicle; urging them toward the truth; urging them to act on it; urging them to protect the Dharma; urging them to teach what they have studied; urging them to not discriminate among various types of beings; urging them to be equally generous to those who have faulty discipline and those who observe discipline; urging them to declare the work of Māra; urging them to fulfill their promises; urging them to not grow weary of cyclic existence; urging them to subdue Māra; urging them to be grateful and appreciative; urging them to eliminate the cause; urging them to not be afraid of the gateways to liberation; urging them to worship and serve the Thus-Gone One; urging them to joyfully consider ways to help beings; {{page:{number:16,id:UT22084-066-010-205,folio:F.68.b}}} urging them to not mix that with worldly Dharma; urging them to delight in the deep forest; urging them to have few desires and be content; urging them toward the past as well as the future;{{note:{index:11,id:UT22084-066-010-105}}} urging them to liberate those who are not liberated; urging them to comfort those who are not comforted; urging those who have not passed into parinirvāṇa to pass into parinirvāṇa;{{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-066-010-106}}} urging them to not interrupt the lineage of the Three Jewels; and urging them to accept the array of good qualities of the buddhafield as completely pure. Divine being, those are the thirty-five teachings that ripen the awakening of bodhisattvas. 
{{milestone:{label:1.79,id:UT22084-066-010-107}}}“Divine being, bodhisattvas who have been ripened do not waver from unsurpassed and perfect awakening. No opponent whatsoever can overpower them. From then on, they no longer fear{{note:{index:13,id:UT22084-066-010-108}}} a bodhisattva’s ten types of pride. The ten types of pride are these: pride due to being disciplined; pride due to being learned; pride due to being eloquent; pride due to being successful, revered, and praised; pride due to living in the deep forest; pride due to one’s ascetic practices and having few belongings; pride due to being attractive, wealthy, powerful, and having attendants; pride due to Śakra, Brahmā, and the world protectors offering service; pride due to one’s absorption and supernatural perception; and being free from any arrogance due to the fact that the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas who have faith in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha are fond of, praise, and glorify them. Divine being, they are not at all arrogant due to those ten types of a bodhisattva’s pride.”
{{milestone:{label:1.80,id:UT22084-066-010-109}}}The god Śrībhadra then said to Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta, “Mañjuśrī, {{page:{number:17,id:UT22084-066-010-206,folio:F.69.a}}} wherever you are and wherever this Dharma teaching is practiced, the Buddha will be seen there, turning the wheel of Dharma.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.81,id:UT22084-066-010-110}}}The Blessed One replied, “Yes, divine being, that is correct. What you say is true. Wherever Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta is, that place will not seem empty.{{note:{index:14,id:UT22084-066-010-111}}} Wherever this Dharma teaching is performed, that is the endeavor of the Thus-Gone One, the lord of Dharma. Those beings who hear this Dharma teaching and develop interest in it become my followers. The beings who hear this Dharma teaching and develop interest in it should be regarded as having been trained by the Thus-Gone One. Those who understand this Dharma teaching and persist in their pursuit of suchness will not regress from unsurpassed and perfect awakening.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.82,id:UT22084-066-010-112}}}The Blessed One then said to the bodhisattva Maitreya, the elder Mahā­kāśyapa, and Venerable Ānanda, “Holy beings, I entrust this Dharma teaching to you so that you may adopt, uphold, teach, and master it. Soon I will pass into parinirvāṇa, so rely on this Dharma teaching that carries out the buddhas’ work for all beings.”
{{milestone:{label:1.83,id:UT22084-066-010-113}}}Then Maitreya inquired, “Blessed One, since we will uphold this Dharma teaching, what is its name? How should it be remembered?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.84,id:UT22084-066-010-114}}}“Maitreya,” the Blessed One replied, “you should remember this Dharma teaching as The Fourfold Accomplishment, The Path of the Bodhisattvas, or Ripening the Bodhisattvas.”
{{milestone:{label:1.85,id:UT22084-066-010-115}}}After the Blessed One had said this, the bodhisattva Maitreya, {{page:{number:18,id:UT22084-066-010-207,folio:F.69.b}}} Venerable Mahā­kāśyapa, Venerable Ānanda, and the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised the Blessed One’s words. 
{{milestone:{label:1.86,id:UT22084-066-010-116}}}This concludes The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra “The Fourfold Accomplishment.”
