The Gods
{{milestone:{label:4.1,id:UT22084-068-021-2360}}}“The monk who has knowledge of the ripening of the effects of karmic action has now carefully examined and understood all the extremely subtle karmic ripening that ensues from the misdeeds associated with hell beings, animals, and starving spirits. Having internalized this understanding, he will next begin to examine the karmic effects that ripen due to wholesome actions. All sentient beings are opposed to suffering {{page:{number:578,id:UT22084-068-021-100605,folio:F.53.b,volume:V69}}} and wish for happiness. As for the gods, they take delight in accumulating happiness, so now the monk will examine the extremely subtle karmic phenomena, ripening, birth, and death of such beings.
{{milestone:{label:4.2,id:UT22084-068-021-2361}}} “It must be clearly understood that the experience that follows from a completed and accumulated virtuous act represents the ripening of a karmic effect that is desirable, attractive, and delightful.
The Six Classes of Gods in the Desire Realm
{{milestone:{label:4.3,id:UT22084-068-021-2363}}}“In this regard there are seven forms of discipline that lead to birth in the higher realms: three of the body and four of the voice. By resorting to, becoming habituated to, and increasing such acts, one will be born as a member of the six classes of gods who live in the desire realm. Based on whether the acts were lesser, intermediate, or great, the existences of those gods are, correspondingly, lesser, intermediate, or great. Thus, they may experience short, intermediate, or long lives; inferior, intermediate, or excellent food; inferior, intermediate, or excellent bodies; inferior, intermediate, or excellent vigor; or lesser, intermediate, or great happiness. Two of these six classes of gods live upon Mount Sumeru, and the remaining four live in the sky above it, as if in cloudbanks.
The Heaven of the Four Great Kings
{{milestone:{label:4.A.4,id:UT22084-068-021-2365}}}“Put concisely, the first class of gods comprises those in the realm of the Four Great Kings.
The Garland-Bearer Gods
{{milestone:{label:4.A.5,id:UT22084-068-021-2367}}}“The first of their subclasses are the garland bearers, who live and reside upon all four sides of Mount Sumeru. The garland bearers differ in terms of the directions. They have different names and distinct karmic actions, and so they spend their lives—produced by numerous karmic actions—experiencing happiness but having many different types of bodies, youthfulness, and agility. The web of karmic action is like the imprint of a seal: it is not uncaused, not random, and not produced by any other action. Therefore, those who wish for happiness {{page:{number:579,id:UT22084-068-021-100606,folio:F.54.a,volume:V69}}} should pursue wholesome qualities.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.6,id:UT22084-068-021-2368}}} “Since time without beginning, sentient beings have been caught in the web of karmic action that consists of their wholesome, unwholesome, and neutral deeds. Ensnared in this web, they roam through cyclic existence, spinning through the worlds of hell beings, animals, and humans as if caught on the rim of a water wheel. Such beings are like actors in a play where those who engage in wholesome deeds take birth in the world of the gods.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.7,id:UT22084-068-021-2369}}} “The divine abode of Sumeru, the king of mountains, is surrounded by sixty thousand mountains and illuminated by the light from garlands of various blazing jewels. Adorned with cascades, ponds, and lotus pools, its surface measures eighty-four thousand leagues. Its four sides are made of precious stone and surrounded by gods who have previously engaged in good deeds. The ground is pleasant and brightly illuminated in many delightful ways. The monk will begin by the examining the various aspects of that ground.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.8,id:UT22084-068-021-2370}}} “The first of the abodes on that ground is that of the garland-bearer gods, which includes ten distinct realms: Peripheral, Lateral, Sustained by Fruition, Experiencing Wholesome Qualities, Universal Joy, Swift Movement, Attached to Objects, Attached to Pleasures, Moving Mind, and Living in Forests and Parks. Thus, ten realms are discerned. The side of Mount Sumeru that faces Jambudvīpa is called Peripheral, and the adjacent realm just below it is known as Lateral. On the side that faces Godānīya in the west lies Sustained by Fruition, and close to that is Experiencing Wholesome Qualities. {{page:{number:580,id:UT22084-068-021-100607,folio:F.54.b,volume:V69}}} In the eastern direction toward Videha lies Universal Joy, and close to that is Swift Movement. On the northern slope facing Kuru is Attached to Objects, and after that lies Attached to Pleasures. Close to that realm lie Moving Mind and Living in Forests and Parks. Each of these realms measures one thousand leagues, the first of which begins at sea level. As for their lifespans, fifty human years equals one day and one night for those gods, and they may live for up to five hundred of their own years. Some die after reaching such a timespan, whereas others die prematurely.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.9,id:UT22084-068-021-2371}}} “Next, the monk who has knowledge of the effects of the ripening of karmic actions will examine the joys of those realms, wondering, ‘What actions may cause birth in those places?’ As he examines this question with knowledge derived from hearing, he will see that the following positive deed leads to such a birth. When people with extremely devoted, clear, undistracted minds take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha, they will later, when they separate from their bodies, proceed to the joyful higher realms and be born in the world known as Peripheral—taking refuge with an extremely devoted mind is the cause of such a birth. When born in that realm, one’s body will be splendid and adorned with a natural radiance, and one will live in happiness. To give a slight indication, the pleasures of a universal monarch cannot match as much as a sixteenth of the pleasures of this divine realm.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.10,id:UT22084-068-021-2372}}} “The sand inside the waters of this realm is composed of pearl and is known as wishes fulfilled. The power of that sand is such that the gods who inhabit Peripheral and Lateral can obtain whatever they wish for from water from their rivers. {{page:{number:581,id:UT22084-068-021-100608,folio:F.55.a,volume:V69}}} There is also a river known as Flow of Pearls and Coral, which is always lined by goddesses. Numerous jewels flow with the river, and thus it yields beryl sticks, vajra pieces, sapphires, great sapphires, and various stones with the color of fire. Such stones emerge so that the gods in Peripheral can adorn themselves with them. Whichever ornament the gods may wish to wear will surface in the river.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.11,id:UT22084-068-021-2373}}} “In this realm also flows the so-called Incense River, adorned with swans, ducks, and geese. On both banks of the river grow regular trees and trees of gold. These trees have myriad shapes and colors and are home to a variety of birds. The scents of the trees are enrapturing to the gods, and so, as they continuously indulge in the smell of these scents, their pleasures are multiplied a hundredfold and satisfy all the five senses. Some of the trees have red branches and green leaves, others have green branches and red leaves. There are also trees bearing foliage of five colors, displaying leaves that are blue, yellow, green, black, and white. Beautiful multicolored bees swarm around the trees with a most charming humming. In this way, the gods relish, savor, and enjoy the effects of wholesome actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.12,id:UT22084-068-021-2374}}} “Mount Sumeru also features various peaks, cliffs, and caves comprised of various jewels. On this tall and colorful mountain are cooling waterfalls, {{page:{number:582,id:UT22084-068-021-100609,folio:F.55.b,volume:V69}}} birds singing delightfully, and an environment rich in fragrance and always in season. The mountain is adorned with the seven precious substances, and here the gods in Peripheral amuse and enjoy themselves, intoxicated by their numerous pleasures. Surrounded by various goddesses, they laugh, pose, and play around. Thus, until the desirable, attractive, and delightful ripening of the act of taking refuge in the Three Jewels comes to an end, they will continue to experience the pleasures of the five senses. And in the future they will even attain the limit of the transcendence of suffering. If they are born with the general lot in life of a human, they will, in accordance with their causal actions, experience constant and supreme pleasures and be wealthy.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.13,id:UT22084-068-021-2375}}} “The monk who has knowledge of the effects of the ripening of karmic actions will continue to examine the world of the gods, and so, applying knowledge derived from hearing, he will perceive another realm of the garland-bearer gods, known as Lateral. Wondering what action may cause one to be born in that god realm, he will examine this matter with knowledge derived from hearing. Thus, he will perceive how someone who observes discipline may be considerate toward others who also observe discipline and may construct a bridge or a boat for them so that they might be free from discomfort when having to cross a large river. If such people otherwise abstain from negative actions, they will, upon separating from their bodies, go to the joyful higher realms and be born among the gods in the divine realm of Lateral. Born there, they will experience the consequences of their wholesome actions, and thus enjoy the various pleasures of that god realm.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.14,id:UT22084-068-021-2376}}} “This realm is surrounded by lotus pools full of water that is cool, limpid, fragrant, and unpolluted. {{page:{number:583,id:UT22084-068-021-100610,folio:F.56.a,volume:V69}}} The place is also always full of joking, flirtatious, and playful goddesses who engage in lovemaking. The gods born there are worshiped by great harems of goddesses and wear various precious ornaments on their bodies. They listen to the five types of instruments and enjoy themselves as the goddesses play around with them. In forests, groves, pools, and parks, they experience happiness. The pools are known as Easy Flow, Lovely Girl, Delightful Sight, Ever-Joyous, Cloud Garland, Garland of Pools, Fulfillment of Wishes, and Non-perception of Time.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.15,id:UT22084-068-021-2377}}} “It also has forests that present a most delightful and agreeable spectacle and that are fanned by pleasant breezes. Studded with beautiful flowers, the four forests of this realm are known as Fragrant, Colorful, Happy Bees, and Always Delightful. Surrounded by many different goddesses, the gods partake of the five sense pleasures in those forests, enjoying themselves with passionate minds.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.16,id:UT22084-068-021-2378}}} “And so, adorned with numerous precious ornaments, the gods move without impediment or discomfort to wherever they please. Their attachment to the objects of the five senses is like a mountain stream, and with each day their pleasures increase. Their senses are like the water and their desires like waves. Rollicking in this way, they roam from grove to grove, forest to forest, pool to pool, and from one golden mountain peak adorned with numerous jewels to the next. The playful goddesses are enrapturing and delightful, holding excellent and exquisite flower garlands. Their varied foods and beverages are deeply satisfying. Thus, as long as these incomparably desirable, attractive, and propitious emanations, {{page:{number:584,id:UT22084-068-021-100611,folio:F.56.b,volume:V69}}} produced by incomparably propitious causes, have not come to exhaustion, the gods will continue to experience pleasure.

Wondering what karmic action may cause one to be born among the gods there, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing. He will then notice how some people, who observe physical and verbal discipline and have serene and loving minds, may arrive in a region afflicted by bad harvests and think, ‘Let me satisfy and bring happiness to starving travelers by providing them with fine crops.’ Thus, to benefit and provide for sentient beings, they may plant fruit trees or construct parks, thereby bringing tremendous happiness to others. When such people later separate from their bodies, they will go to the joyful higher realms and be born among the gods in the divine realm known as Sustained by Fruition.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.19,id:UT22084-068-021-2381}}} “In that realm they will be surrounded by youthful goddesses with incomparable figures and indulge in unparalleled pleasures. In the forests and groves grow exquisite divine flowers and fruits, and the trees bear thick golden foliage that resounds with the tinkling of bangles. There these gods will enjoy themselves tremendously as their five senses, which are so attached to pleasure, meet with the most exquisite enjoyments.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.20,id:UT22084-068-021-2382}}} “The parks in that realm include the following: Yielding All Fruits, {{page:{number:585,id:UT22084-068-021-100612,folio:F.57.a,volume:V69}}} Ground of Constant Joy, High and Low, Thoroughly Enjoyable, Always Joyous, Constantly Crazed Bees, and Golden Shadow. In these forests the gods enjoy themselves surrounded by goddesses, among lotus pools and ponds, and to the delightful sound of flowing water. The environment is illuminated by the light of their own bodies and the glimmering trees. The birds sing in constant delight, the food is plentiful and unconsumed, and the myriad mountain peaks are adorned with the seven precious substances. Among those mountain peaks the gods enjoy their pleasures. The summits on Mount Sumeru are known as Mountainous Light Garland, Jaṃbu Forest, White Water, Joyful Garland, and Constant Joy. Among those summits the gods enjoy the results of their positive actions. Due to their own good actions they remain constantly enamored by the objects there. In the places just described, they enjoy such pleasures and gratify themselves together with hundreds of goddesses.

Attached to the five objects, they thus experience numerous pleasures. The forms that they enjoy are continuous and abundant. They cannot be robbed from these gods, nor can others carry{{note:{index:256,id:UT22084-068-021-2424}}} them away. Their divine food and drink is beautiful to behold and has numerous exquisite smells and tastes. And so these gods wander happily and joyfully, roaming where they please in accordance with their karmic actions. Surrounded by numerous goddesses, they wander from forest to forest, lotus pond to lotus pond, and park to park, partaking of diverse pleasures.

The abundant pleasures that these gods experience by means of their divine bodies are incomparable and cannot be stolen by anyone. Thus, until those karmic actions have been exhausted, these gods will continue to experience such desirable, attractive, and delightful results, which have been produced in relation to a sacred recipient and therefore eventually will lead to the transcendence of suffering. Only when these karmic actions have been exhausted will they die and leave their divine world behind. {{page:{number:593,id:UT22084-068-021-100620,folio:F.61.a,volume:V69}}} In accordance with their karmic actions, they will then be born among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. If karmic actions to be experienced as a human lead them to rebirth as a human, they will become the head of a city or a town. They will have much wealth, great intelligence, and an extremely enjoyable life. Finally, due to having performed positive actions in relation to an excellent recipient, they will pass beyond suffering.

Wondering what karmic actions may cause beings to be born among the gods there, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing. He will then notice how during a forest fire some people who observe discipline may save living beings from the fire by spraying water and so, in an instant, protect those beings that were otherwise on the verge of death. When such people later separate from their bodies, they will ascend to the joyful higher realms and be born among the garland-bearer gods.

Forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures will constantly delight them, and they will be surrounded by coteries of hundreds of goddesses playing musical instruments, with whom they will joyfully engage in the ways of love. Their great palaces are decorated with golden fences and resound with the ringing of small bells. In the windows dangle nets of pearls and hundreds of blue jewels festoon the rooms. There, the gods enjoy themselves surrounded by many harems of goddesses. Whichever goddess they lay their eyes on {{page:{number:594,id:UT22084-068-021-100621,folio:F.61.b,volume:V69}}} will arouse them and bring them pleasure. Liking what they see, they will become captivated and harbor thoughts of pleasure. Such are the goddesses that surround them, adorned by a multitude of ornaments and costumes, always fragrant with perfumes, and always impassioned. The sight of these goddesses is deeply gratifying.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.64,id:UT22084-068-021-2428}}} “The beautiful sounds that they hear are desirable, attractive, and delightful. All around the mountains, rivers, and shrubbery sing numerous kinds of golden birds with legs and beaks of coral. It is not possible to provide any simile for the beautiful sounds that these gods hear when they travel to the mountains, canyons, and flower meadows, or when they swim in the waters, fly through the sky, wander the cliffs and flatlands, or enter the caves in the mountains of gold. Moreover, their ears also perceive only what is desirable, attractive, and delightful.

Thus, they smell aromatic flowers that are delightful beyond compare, goddesses of the sweetest fragrance, and numerous other types of gratifying aromas. In this way, their noses also only sense what is desirable, attractive, and delightful. Their tongues also taste various ambrosias that are so sumptuous that no human honey wine could equal even a hundred thousandth of their taste. This is just a small illustration of their flavor. Their bodies enjoy the texture of natural garments that have not been produced by weaving. This cloth is smooth, soft, fine, pleasing to the touch, and brings much joy to those who wear it. As for the minds of these gods, whatever they may wish for comes to pass, {{page:{number:595,id:UT22084-068-021-100622,folio:F.62.a,volume:V69}}} and so they experience nothing but desirable, attractive, delightful, and extraordinary events.

Having examined these various enjoyable ripenings by means of knowledge derived from hearing, the monk will think the following:

Then they will die, and after their death, they will be reborn among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals, in accordance with their karmic actions. If they are born with the general lot in life of a human, they will, in accordance with their causal actions, possess tremendous enjoyments and live in freedom from fear. Appreciated by everyone and respected by kings, they will be free from harm for as long as they are alive. Those who previously gave the gift of freedom from fear will eventually go beyond suffering.

Wondering what karmic actions may cause beings to be born among the gods there, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing. He will then notice how some people who maintain a wholesome livelihood may reconcile friends, companions, and relatives who have fallen into discord and are otherwise intent on harming one another. When later such people, who reconcile opposing parties out of a wish to help them, separate from their bodies, they will go to the joyful higher realms and take birth among the gods in the heaven of Attached to Objects.

Adorned with cascades, lotus flowers, parks, and jewels, these wish-fulfilling rivers flow with an enrapturing sound that is accompanied by the cheerful warbling of birds. Wherever the rivers flow, there such beauty always abounds. However, wherever the rivers do not reach, even though there are numerous forms, sounds, smells, and tastes, and plenty of women, they are not of the best kind and the women appear unattractive, as if they were pregnant. In such cases, this heaven is not so delightful. For this reason, in this divine world, water is of foremost importance. Birth takes place from water and water causes delight. Among all the afflictive tastes that those gods may experience within their parks and resorts, the flavor of their water is supreme. Thus, water is an ornament and a practical necessity for gods as well as humans. All the objectives and pursuits of both gods and humans depend on water. Understanding water to be endowed with such qualities, {{page:{number:598,id:UT22084-068-021-100625,folio:F.63.b,volume:V69}}} these gods who delight in water will partake of water with tremendous appreciation, enjoying the rivers and their melodious sounds as they flow by.

On the trees they will see reflected all that they are to experience due to their previous positive karmic actions. By the power of those positive actions, they will in this way see both good and bad actions reflected among the trees, on the open ground between the groves, upon the golden, mirror-like ground, or on the cleared ground between the groves. Thus, among the trees, the patches of land between the groves, and the cleared ground, they will see those pleasures that are due to positive actions, just as they will see any negative actions that they may have accumulated throughout hundreds of previous lives. Whenever they see the products of their good actions, the whole environment will appear as delightful as before.

Therefore, if they have undertaken filthy acts that are associated with life in hell, they will see those as well. In other words, they will witness all the previously described tortures of the Reviving Hell, the Black Line Hell, the Crushing Hell, the Howling Hell, the Great Howling Hell, and so forth. In this way they will perceive all the circumstances in all the various realms, down to the hells, just as described before. Just as they see the unparalleled pleasures of the gods, {{page:{number:599,id:UT22084-068-021-100626,folio:F.64.a,volume:V69}}} they will also perceive the numerous sufferings of the beings in hell.

As they perceive the numerous, extremely unpleasant, painful features of life in hell, they are no longer able to experience their pleasures as enjoyable. As an analogy, if an ounce of salt is added to the river Gaṅgā, it will not be noticeable. In the same way, such a god’s mind will now be unable to notice the pleasures that are otherwise to be experienced in the heavens. The god’s enjoyment of melodious songs to the accompaniment of instruments, and the various delightful birdsongs, can at that point of recollection no longer be noticed within the clearing of the forest.

Yet, upon the trunk of a tree he may then see reflected his own suffering as a starving spirit, experiencing the torments of hunger and thirst.

Then, as they once again come under the influence of their divine pleasures, they will regain their attachments to beautiful forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures. They will once again enjoy themselves in the forests and parks, on the banks of the various lotus ponds, in places where the birds sing in numerous ways, and within the clearings of the forests. There, they will enjoy themselves together with goddesses adorned with sundry accessories and fashions.

Impelled by karmic action that is certain to be experienced, they may then see themselves as animals that prey on, and become the prey of, other animals. In accordance with their past actions, they will thus witness the tremendous suffering of the animals that feed on one another. When they see themselves in that way, they become extremely displeased, wondering, ‘Why do I see myself with such a huge and ugly body, undergoing so much suffering?’ They will also inquire with others in the same way as before. In this manner, these gods, whose minds are so attached to objects and who have fallen under the power of attractive forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures, are introduced to the sufferings of cyclic existence.{{note:{index:259,id:UT22084-068-021-2450}}}

Seeing that, the gods will think, ‘Due to those causes, conditions, and bases, after separating from my body, I went to the higher realms and was born among the gods.’ These gods will see for themselves how karmic action is appropriated and how one’s experience is one’s karmic allotment. Seeing that will make them unhappy. However, as their minds are fickle, they will again come under the sway of their divine pleasures, {{page:{number:601,id:UT22084-068-021-100628,folio:F.65.a,volume:V69}}} and so they will return to their enjoyment of attractive forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures.

Thus, they may see how they are to be born among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. As they see themselves turning into such beings, they will become extremely distraught. At that point they will think, ‘This place is impermanent, unstable, and subject to change. I will have to die and leave it behind. These goddesses I cannot keep. Alas, all phenomena must fall apart. All conditioned things are short-lived, because they are unstable and subject to harm. We will all have to leave one another.’

Wondering how these gods live, enjoy themselves, and indulge their desires, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing. In this way, he comes to understand that the realms of the vessel-bearer gods likewise number ten: Sporting Among Lotuses, Pleasant Humming of Bees, Attached to Sound, Enraptured by Smell, Enjoying the Wind, Delighting in Flower Garlands, {{page:{number:608,id:UT22084-068-021-100635,folio:F.68.b,volume:V69}}}Viewing, Happiness, Attached to Smell, and Crown Escape.

He will then notice how some people are disciplined, maintain a wholesome livelihood, and train their minds. If such people three times say, ‘Homage to Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha!’ then that constitutes a karmic action that ultimately will lead to the complete transcendence of suffering. Moreover, as it ripens in the human realm, when they die and separate from their bodies, they will go to the joyful higher realms and be born among the vessel-bearer gods in the realm known as Sporting Among Lotuses.

Because, except for a universal monarch or someone free of desire, {{page:{number:609,id:UT22084-068-021-100636,folio:F.69.a,volume:V69}}} such sounds are not objects accessible to humans.

Thus, by sundry means and through numerous sources of craving, they experience copious enjoyments.

He will then notice how some attentive people who train their minds and bodies may, in order to accumulate merit, offer members of the saṅgha a park, a sugarcane field, a sugar date palm grove, or a mango grove, so that they can make use of that gift.

When the gods hear the singing of these birds and also the singing of other birds that live in the forests, they listen keenly with their divine hearing. Although their minds are so attached to all the pleasures of their environment, their hearts become so fond of the birds’ singing that they abandon all other pleasures in order to listen to the birds. As they hear the exquisite singing of the birds, they will experience numerous kinds of pleasure. In this way, they listen as the birds sing their sweet melodies in seven different tunes.

Were I to obtain similar possessions, I too would give them away.’ When such faithful beings who think in this way later separate from their bodies, they will go to the joyful higher realms and be born among the gods in Engagement with a Retinue.

Thus, they will enjoy themselves and frolic within forests that resonate with the music of the five types of instruments, in beryl ponds that are adorned with jewel banisters and studded with golden lotuses, and in parks and groves where birds warble and chirrup excitedly. Some will frolic together with goddesses within dense forests where cuckoos and peacocks make their beautiful and evocative cries. Some will enjoy themselves among groves of lotuses that have stems of beryl, petals of gold, and anthers of diamond. Some will drink winter wine and frolic in groves with desirous goddesses who are drunk on those fruits that produce winter wine. Some will enjoy themselves in mountainous areas where the peaks are studded with rocks of beryl. Some will enjoy themselves together with cherished beauties within streams of stainless, clean water that flows from lapis lazuli mountain peaks. Some will enjoy themselves at bathing pools where cool, clean, and stainless streams flow over sandy beds of pearls. Some will enjoy themselves within towering multistoried buildings that are adorned with the seven precious substances. Some will enjoy themselves surrounded by harems of goddesses and to the sound of the five types of instruments. Some will enjoy themselves among beautiful wish-fulfilling trees draped with nets of tinkling bells. Some will enjoy themselves together with beloved and desired companions within groves of trees that remain exceptionally delightful throughout the six seasons. Some will enjoy themselves as they ascend mountain peaks to behold the rivers that flow through a landscape adorned with pure gold. In this way their divine enjoyments, which are produced by their own karmic actions, {{page:{number:675,id:UT22084-068-021-100702,folio:F.102.a,volume:V69}}} constitute an array of pleasures that know no example.

Their noses insatiably smell enjoyable objects in the form of numerous distinct and delectable fragrances. Their tongues insatiably savor enjoyable objects in the form of exquisitely delicious, luscious tastes. Their bodies insatiably feel enjoyable objects in the form of numerous smooth and appealing textures. Their minds insatiably perceive numerous unsullied objects that are desirable, attractive, and delightful. Thus, with their six senses attached to their respective objects, these gods are insatiable.

Obscured by their craving, these insatiable gods cannot see any end to their intense pleasure, and so they continue enjoying themselves, experiencing copious, unparalleled pleasures. This goes on until finally their positive acts with desirable, attractive, and delightful effects have been exhausted. Once that happens, they will die and leave their divine world. At that point, their own former karmic actions will make them take birth within the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. If, however, they should be born with the general lot in life of a human, they will, in accordance with their causal deeds, become members of a guild of seafaring merchants, or a guild of merchants who are stationed in a marketplace, or who are based in mountainous regions.

Wondering what karmic actions may cause beings to take birth there, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing. He will then notice how a person with genuine compassion may save another person who is swept away by a river, or how at the time of famine someone may save a person who is on the verge of death. Thus, with a mind saturated by love, people may protect another person as if he or she were their own child. They may do this without any ulterior motive but only through the power that comes from having trained one’s mind with attentiveness.

The forest possesses magnificent trees that are flush with flowers and some that abound with fruits. The flowering trees are exceptionally fragrant and their flowers of different colors and shapes float through the air up to a distance of five leagues. They are colored blue, yellow, green, red, and maroon, and their shapes are round like Takṣaka, elongated, square, and they resemble those earrings, necklaces, and finger rings that delight the gods.

As they behold each other, the god and the goddesses experience an indescribable happiness. Delighting in each another, they will, to the accompaniment of the five types of instruments, experience an array of pleasures just like other gods do.

As they frolic through numerous forests and parks and along the banks of rushing rivers, they will come to the so-called Crystal Forest. All the trees in this forest are made of bright crystal and they bear abundant flowers and fruits. The flowers and leaves are all luminous like talc and clear like mirrors.

Only later will the yakṣas come to report on the actions of humanity to the great king. Virūpākṣa therefore appreciates this forest, as it allows him to see all the righteous and unrighteous actions that human beings in Jambudvīpa engage in.

The Wandering Gods
{{milestone:{label:4.A.407,id:UT22084-068-021-2800}}}“Then, among the four realms of the Four Great Kings, only the so-called wandering gods remain. {{page:{number:682,id:UT22084-068-021-100709,folio:F.105.b,volume:V69}}} These gods circle the sides of Mount Sumeru. They soar in their chariots and are therefore thought by non-Buddhists to be planets, stars, and other celestial bodies. Roughly counted, they number three hundred and sixty million.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.408,id:UT22084-068-021-2801}}} “Wondering what karmic actions may cause beings to take birth there, the monk will apply knowledge derived from hearing. He will then see that such a birth is due to various manifestations of the seven types of discipline—three of the body and four of speech. In short, beings are born there as the result of numerous karmic actions. He understands this in terms of the particular conditions that take the form of virtuous and unvirtuous actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.409,id:UT22084-068-021-2802}}} “The sun and the moon are also wandering gods that orbit Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains. In the same way, all wandering gods orbit Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains, due to the so-called circulating wind. Within this vast expanse reside Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Kubera, and these gods circle the four continents together with those great kings. Thus, within various chariots made of blue, yellow, and green jewels, the wandering gods enjoy, as explained before, the pleasures of the five senses until finally their completed and accumulated acts with desirable, attractive, and delightful effects have been exhausted. They will then, in accordance with their karmic actions, be born in the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. Should they be born with the general lot in life of a human, they will, in accordance with their causal actions, constantly relocate from one country to another. In this way, whether their discipline causes them to be happy or unhappy, they constantly migrate.

As he fails to see any other realm beyond this, he will think, ‘The gods of the Four Great Kings are infinite and have no limits.’
{{milestone:{label:4.A.411,id:UT22084-068-021-2804}}} “The previous actions of these gods now cause them to meander through and enjoy themselves amid the forests and parks in these four realms upon Mount Sumeru. As the sun orbits Mount Sumeru, the shadow of the mountain falls on the various realms of humans, and thus it turns to night in Jambudvīpa. As the northern wind known as circular shape begins to circulate, it prevents all the northern stars from rising and setting. In this manner, the power of that wind will keep them hovering there. Certain non-Buddhists do not understand this and do not know how to examine the stars. Consequently, they adopt a simplistic position, believing that it is a ferocious crocodile that prevents the stars from setting while the seven sages are holding the world.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.412,id:UT22084-068-021-2806}}} “When the monk has in this way seen each and every god of the Four Great Kings, as well as their domains, he will become weary of cyclic existence. Understanding the suffering of falling gods, he will become disenchanted, thinking that in cyclic existence there is no place that is permanent, stable, enduring, or unchanging. Thus, everyone must experience their share of meeting and parting, and their share of karmic action. Beings live in the realm of karmic action and no one is independent of karmic action. This the monk will understand by means of knowledge derived from hearing. Therefore, he will pursue spiritual practice and abide by the observation of inner phenomena.
The Seventeenth Ground
{{milestone:{label:4.A.413,id:UT22084-068-021-2807}}}“The monk understands that childish ordinary people come to depend on the objects of their liking and so give rise to the causes of craving. Such people may then pursue pure conduct, wishing to be born in the higher realms {{page:{number:684,id:UT22084-068-021-100711,folio:F.106.b,volume:V69}}} and expecting to be happy there. Yet, the monk does not view the happiness of the gods as real happiness. Instead, as he looks at it with knowledge derived from hearing, he does not become attracted or attached, nor does he relish the experience of the gods. Rather, he has the power to battle the māras and he develops the wish to go beyond the ocean of cyclic existence. Thus, he enters the seventeenth ground.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.414,id:UT22084-068-021-2808}}} “When the terrestrial yakṣas hear this, they will inform the celestial yakṣas, who in turn will pass the news on to the gods of the Four Great Kings. In this manner, the news will, in the same way as before, gradually reach the gods in Limitless Light. At this point, the gods will tell one another, ‘In Jambudvīpa the noble son known as so-and-so, who is from such and such an area, town, family, land, and people, has shaved off his hair and beard, donned the saffron-colored robes, and with faith emerged from the household to become a homeless mendicant. Waging battle on the māras, he endeavors diligently and wishes to go beyond the horrors of existence.’
{{milestone:{label:4.A.415,id:UT22084-068-021-2809}}} “Hearing this, the gods in Limitless Light will become most exulted and thus they will respond, ‘Gods, in the world of humans, there are definitely people who are righteous and follow the Dharma. There are people who train in wakefulness, who immerse themselves in practice, and who wage battle with the māras. The forces of the māras are down and the forces of the sacred Dharma are up! The sacred Dharma taught by the buddhas is flourishing!’
{{milestone:{label:4.A.416,id:UT22084-068-021-2810}}}“At this point the monk will investigate discipline by asking himself, ‘Is it due to a lack of discipline or a lack of knowledge that people are not born as gods in the higher realms?’
{{milestone:{label:4.A.417,id:UT22084-068-021-2811}}} “As he examines this matter with knowledge derived from hearing, he will see that discipline itself can lead to birth in the higher realms. Generosity alone will not bring birth there, although it does result in enormous wealth. Knowledge prevents one from going to the lower realms after death. {{page:{number:685,id:UT22084-068-021-100712,folio:F.107.a,volume:V69}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.A.418,id:UT22084-068-021-2812}}} “Wondering about the character of the discipline that brings birth in the world of the gods, the monk will apply knowledge derived from hearing. He will then see how the seven forms of discipline yield inferior, intermediate, and superior births among the gods. Thus, giving up killing leads to birth among the gods of the Four Great Kings. Renouncing killing and stealing leads to birth among the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. Giving up killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct leads to birth among the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife. By taking vows and thus refraining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct, as well as from lying, divisive talk, harsh words, and chatter, one will be born among the gods in the Heaven of Joy. By taking mundane vows and having faith exclusively in the Buddha, in addition to refraining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct, as well as lying, divisive talk, harsh words, and chatter, one will be born among the gods in the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations. Likewise, by refraining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct, as well as lying, divisive talk, harsh words, and chatter, one will be born among the gods in the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.419,id:UT22084-068-021-2813}}} “As the monk in this way acknowledges how karmic actions combined with discipline lead to birth in the world of the gods, he will ask himself where and how people who have taken vows are born. Examining this matter with knowledge derived from hearing, he will understand that those who have taken a vow to give up killing are born in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, because abandoning killing results in a body size, vigor, complexion, mastery, and longevity that are greater than one had before. Those who have taken a vow to give up killing as well as stealing are born in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, because this relinquishment yields such a body size, vigor, joy, appearance, power, {{page:{number:686,id:UT22084-068-021-100713,folio:F.107.b,volume:V69}}} mastery, and tremendous longevity. Resorting to, becoming habituated to, and increasing the relinquishment of killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct, one will be born in the Heaven of Free from Strife, because such relinquishment yields that most excellent body size, complexion, mastery, lifespan, and so forth. Birth in the Heaven of Joy is due to a special combination of attention and knowledge, which yields an utterly supreme body size, complexion, mastery, faith, bliss, and longevity. Taking and observing a vow to give up killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and divisive talk leads to birth in the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations because such relinquishment yields such a tremendous body size, complexion, bliss, power, physique, and longevity. One will not listen to the words of the evil Māra but remain indomitable to him.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.420,id:UT22084-068-021-2814}}} “Next the monk who has knowledge of the effects of the ripening of karmic actions will ask himself how discipline can plant the seeds for birth in the higher realms and he will examine this matter in great detail. Investigating the matter in this way, he will understand that mind and great mental states engage in lesser, intermediate, and greater forms of discipline. Thus, he will see how, in the case of the six classes of gods living within the desire realm, a specific mind produces specific mental states, which in turn produce a particular form of discipline that causes such specific births.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.421,id:UT22084-068-021-2815}}} “As the monk continues to examine discipline, he will wonder about its various categories. Investigating this matter, he notices that discipline may be either {{page:{number:687,id:UT22084-068-021-100714,folio:F.108.a,volume:V69}}} mundane and innate, or produced through composure. Innate discipline is not fabricated whereas that of composure is. Furthermore, he will see that discipline likewise is twofold in terms of whether or not one lives at home. Thus, discipline for householders consists of the five bases for training, whereas discipline for those who do not keep a home comprises the bases of training for those who have taken ordination by means of training in the prātimokṣa.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.422,id:UT22084-068-021-2816}}} “Similarly, there are also the two categories of singular and manifold discipline. Singular discipline is when one adheres to one among the bases for training, whereas manifold discipline is when one adheres to two or three. There is also a twofold division in terms of whether or not one’s discipline is well grounded. Being well grounded means that one adheres to the bases for training throughout all lives, whereas being ungrounded means that one only adheres to the bases for training because of a particular state of mind or inspiration. Discipline may also be either turbid or free from turbidity, where the first refers to the mind that wishes for the higher realms and the second to the mind that wishes to go beyond suffering. Likewise, discipline may be either mundane or supramundane: the first is defiled and the second undefiled. Discipline may also be undertaken personally or undertaken by others. In the first case, one observes discipline oneself, and in the second, one also establishes others in appropriate forms of discipline. Discipline may also take the form of engagement or disengagement. The first type causes engagement in cyclic existence, whereas the second is the cause of wakefulness and thus focuses on wakefulness beyond training. Discipline may also be endowed with wakefulness or endowed with generosity. Discipline endowed with generosity accomplishes great wealth, while discipline endowed with wakefulness achieves the transcendence of suffering. Discipline may likewise be an engagement in outer or inner conduct. {{page:{number:688,id:UT22084-068-021-100715,folio:F.108.b,volume:V69}}} While engagement in outer conduct is based on the body, engagement in inner conduct is carried out by the mind of inspired faith and is of a mental and verbal nature. Discipline may also be familiar or unfamiliar. In the first case one has become accustomed to it across many lives, and in the second familiarization has taken place in one life only. Thus, the monk will examine binary sets of discipline in numerous ways.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.423,id:UT22084-068-021-2817}}} “As the monk thus investigates discipline in tremendous detail, he will ask himself how many types of discipline there might be, and how those types may differ from each other. On this basis, he will notice the following triads of discipline. Discipline may be either one-dimensional, not one-dimensional, or one that transfers to the higher realms. One-dimensional discipline adheres to one among the bases of training, discipline that is not one-dimensional adheres to two or three bases, and discipline that transfers to the higher realms adheres to a wide range of bases of training.

Those who craved for wealth refers to those who live in good health, those who did not crave for wealth are the sickly, and those for whom discipline is innate, which is of a lesser kind, refers to those struck by great suffering.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.425,id:UT22084-068-021-2819}}} “Discipline may also be practiced while one is concentrated, or practiced while one is not concentrated, or it may be practiced as one takes it up. Discipline that is practiced while one is concentrated is practiced by mundane people and prevents the arising of desire and so forth during the time that their conditions are absent. Discipline that is practiced while one is not concentrated comprises non-Buddhist practices that, despite an absence of concentration, must nevertheless be classified as discipline. Discipline that is practiced as one takes it up focuses on flaws and causes one to relinquish them, such as when one abstains from alcohol with the understanding that intoxication may cause one to engage in uncouth conduct.

The observance of hypocritical discipline{{page:{number:689,id:UT22084-068-021-100716,folio:F.109.a,volume:V69}}} is afflicted and has little effect. The observance of unhypocritical discipline has great effect. Depending on the particular mental states, innate discipline may have great or little effect.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.427,id:UT22084-068-021-2821}}} “Discipline may also be embraced with the help of conditions, not embraced with the help of conditions, or by way of non-engagement. Discipline embraced with the help of conditions is when one has properly adopted the discipline of the bases of training. Such discipline is observed while possessing the relevant conditions and it is upheld once one has gathered the bases for training. Discipline that is not embraced with the help of conditions is observed without the former conditions. Discipline of non-engagement refers to not engaging in any misdeeds that should be avoided by members of a high caste. The first of these three is embraced by particular mental states and hence has great effect. The second is ignorant and therefore of little effect. The third refers to what are considered positive deeds in this world and may therefore have either great or little effect.

Discipline that is assumed due to fear of the guru is lesser, discipline that is assumed due to fear of something other than the guru is intermediate, and discipline due to fear of the lower realms is greater.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.429,id:UT22084-068-021-2823}}} “Discipline may also function to make oneself adhere to it, make others adopt it, or make oneself be neutral toward others.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.430,id:UT22084-068-021-2824}}} “Discipline may also be interrupted, uninterrupted, or completely interrupted. Interrupted discipline is when someone who is observing discipline loses it. Uninterrupted discipline is discipline adhered to throughout all lives—in the beginning, the middle, and the end. Completely interrupted discipline is based on wrong view and enjoins one to perform sacrificial acts of killing or the like.

{{milestone:{label:4.A.432,id:UT22084-068-021-2826}}} “Discipline may also be fivefold, as it causes the relinquishment of the five objects. It may also be sixfold: with impediment, without impediment, adopted out of fear of royal punishment, adopted due to a relation, non-analytical, or innate. It may also be sevenfold in relation to the body and speech.
{{milestone:{label:4.A.433,id:UT22084-068-021-2827}}} “As the monk thus examines numerous forms of discipline, he will think, ‘The discipline that frees sentient beings from the terrors of the lower realms is, in short, of two types, for it may be either mundane or supramundane.’
