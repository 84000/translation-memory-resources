{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-055-005-21}}}Thus did I hear at one time: The Blessed One was in the Kalandakanivāpa, at the Veṇuvana near Rājagṛha. He was there together with a great saṅgha of twelve hundred fifty monks, and with three hundred million bodhisattvas, all of whom had attained dhāraṇī, unobstructed eloquence, and mastery over absorption. They dwelled in the absorption of emptiness, their domain was free of marks, their aspiration was uncontrived, they dwelled in the absence of wishes, and their conduct was natural. They had attained the dhāraṇīs that accomplish limitless gateways. They had attained acceptance regarding sameness, they had attained sameness, and they had attained unobstructed dhāraṇī. They knew the higher or lower capacities of all beings {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-055-005-404,folio:F.231.a}}} and had precise knowledge of beings’ thoughts and actions.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-055-005-22}}}At that time, the Blessed One settled into the absorption that is the blessing of the thus-gone one, that enters the domain of all the buddhas. This absorption is formless, indefinable, ungraspable, unimpeded, and not apparent. It is beyond knowledge and not an object of knowledge. It is free from mentation, mind, and consciousness. It is rootless, unsupported, and beyond observation. It is an incomparable, unequaled, and matchless state. It has no notion of “mine,” is free from grasping, is free from anything to avoid, and is uncreated. It never went and never came. It does not go and does not stay. It is without interruption, baseless, and without marks. It is free of all marks. It is beyond accepting and rejecting. It is uncompounded and beyond any accumulation. It is beyond assembling and beyond separating. It is without mind and free from mind. It is unoriginated, beginningless, unestablished, nonarising, and totally nonoccurring. It is utterly beyond movement, perfectly without movement, totally empty, beyond association, and without superimpositions regarding any phenomenon. It is a dhāraṇī gateway to enter the domain of all buddhas. It is known as the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-055-005-23}}}As soon as he settled into that absorption, neither the Blessed One’s body nor the characteristics of his body appeared; neither his mind nor the characteristics of his mind appeared; neither his robes nor the characteristics of his robes appeared; neither his cushion nor the characteristics of his cushion appeared; neither his sleeping nor the characteristics of his sleeping appeared; neither his walking nor the characteristics of his walking appeared; neither his rising nor the characteristics of his rising appeared; neither his remaining nor the characteristics of his remaining appeared; neither his shadow nor the characteristics of his shadow appeared; neither his sitting nor the characteristics of his sitting appeared; and neither his sounds nor the characteristics of his sounds appeared.
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-055-005-24}}}At that point, through the power of this absorption, {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-055-005-405,folio:F.231.b}}} and through the blessings of the Buddha, a bright light filled the entire trichiliocosm. So bright was this light that everywhere in the trichiliocosm the moonlight was outshone, as was the sunlight and the light of stars, fire, jewels, and lightning. The radiance of gandharvas, kiṃnaras, gods of the realms of desire and form, constellations, and divine palaces was outshone. So too were that of Śakra, Brahmā, and the protectors of the worlds.
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-055-005-25}}}Through the Buddha’s blessings and the power of his absorption, some of the gods could no longer smell their divine fragrances, and the whole trichiliocosm was suffused by an aroma sweeter than any other scent that completely transcended the fragrances of the gods. All the dark spaces between the worlds were brought into the light, as were the major and minor mountain ranges that surround the worlds. Mount Meru and all the other principal mountains like it were illuminated, as were the Black Peaks. Subsequently, however, they did not appear to the eye faculties of sentient beings.
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-055-005-26}}}The entire trichiliocosm was encompassed in a net of jewels. The entire Sahā buddha realm was decorated with silk hangings, suffused with frankincense, and strewn with a variety of flowers. Through the power of the Buddha, the Kalandakanivāpa in the Veṇuvana, along with Vulture Peak Mountain, became as level as the palm of a hand and were saturated with the delicious and captivating scent of a giant hundred-thousand-petaled lotus flower composed of various jewels the size of chariot-wheels. From the sky, a lattice-like jeweled canopy appeared, which covered and adorned everything. All of Magadha became soft to the touch, like kācilindika cloth.
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-055-005-27}}}Then in the east, in as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the Ganges, the individual blessed buddhas exhorted a limitless, innumerable, and immeasurable number of hundreds of thousands of bodhisattva great beings who were just one life away from unexcelled and perfect awakening, {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-055-005-406,folio:F.232.a}}} “Sons of noble family, you should go into the Sahā world. That is where the blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni presently resides. He lives there and teaches the Dharma. Now he has settled into the absorption that is a dhāraṇī gateway to enter the domain of all buddhas known as the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal. Sons of noble family, even engaging in the six perfections for a hundred thousand eons, but without skillful means, bears no comparison to the esteem bodhisattvas will feel merely hearing about this absorption. Therefore, go and hear about this absorption.”
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-055-005-28}}}The bodhisattva great beings listened accordingly to the respective thus-gone ones and paid these blessed ones homage. Then, in an instant, they all disappeared from those buddha realms and, by giving rise to their magical powers of superknowledge, they came to the Sahā world, to the four central continents, to the continent of Jambudvīpa, to the town of Rājagṛha, to the Veṇuvana, and into the Kalandakanivāpa, where the blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni was. Upon arriving, they bowed their heads to the feet of the blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni. They then circled the Blessed One three times and stood to one side. The Blessed One welcomed them and they took their places cross-legged upon a great lotus composed of various jewels.
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-055-005-29}}}The same thing happened in the south, west, north, below, above, {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-055-005-407,folio:F.232.b}}}—throughout the cardinal and intermediate directions, and everywhere in between. In all the ten directions, in as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the Ganges, individual blessed buddhas exhorted a limitless, innumerable, and immeasurable number of hundreds of thousands of bodhisattva great beings who were just one life away from unexcelled and perfect awakening, “Sons of noble family, you should go into the Sahā world. That is where the blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni presently resides. He lives there and teaches the Dharma. Now he has settled into the absorption that is a dhāraṇī gateway to enter the domain of all buddhas, known as the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal. Sons of noble family, even engaging in the six perfections for a hundred thousand eons, but without skillful means, bears no comparison to the esteem bodhisattvas will feel merely hearing about this absorption. Therefore, go and hear about this absorption.”
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-055-005-30}}}The bodhisattva great beings listened accordingly to the respective thus-gone ones and paid these blessed ones homage. Then, in an instant, they all disappeared from those buddha realms and, by giving rise to their magical powers of superknowledge, they came to the Sahā world, to the four central continents, to the continent of Jambudvīpa, to the town of Rājagṛha, to the Veṇuvana, and into the Kalandakanivāpa, where the blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni was. Upon arriving, they bowed their heads to the feet of the blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni. They then circled the Blessed One three times and stood to one side. The Blessed One welcomed them and they took their places cross-legged upon a great lotus composed of various jewels. {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-055-005-408,folio:F.233.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-055-005-31}}}Throughout this great trichiliocosm, all the monks—whether engaged with the vehicle of the hearers, the vehicle of the solitary buddhas, or the bodhisattva vehicle—each in their own individual realms, stirred and, through the blessings and power of the Buddha, they all came to Vulture Peak Mountain, where the Blessed One resided. Upon arriving, they could not see the Blessed One anywhere. Not seeing him, they joined their palms and paid homage to him.
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-055-005-32}}}Through the radiance of the absorption of the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal, instantly, in that very moment, eight hundred million bodhisattvas gathered at the Kalandakanivāpa in the Veṇuvana, where they sat down in the Blessed One’s retinue. Three hundred thousand hearers also gathered together and took their seats. Within this great trichiliocosm, many other beings arrived at the Kalandakanivāpa in the Veṇuvana, where the Blessed One was. They included Śakra, Brahmā, the guardians of the world, Maheśvara, the gods of the pure realms, all gods including their lords, all nāgas and their lords, all yakṣas and their lords, all gandharvas and their lords, all asuras and their lords, all garuḍas and their lords, all kiṃnaras and their lords, all mahoragas and their lords, as well as all suparṇis and their lords. Each of these groups also brought with them many quadrillions of servants. As they arrived at the Kalandakanivāpa in the Veṇuvana, where the Blessed One was, no one could see the Blessed One anywhere. Not seeing him, they joined their palms and paid homage to him. {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-055-005-409,folio:F.233.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-055-005-33}}}At that time the powerful and eminent bodhisattva great beings, hearers, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, nonhumans, monks, nuns, and male and female lay practitioners were all assembled. No place was left unfilled in this great trichiliocosm, from the peak of existence on down. Not even the space for the tip of a hair was left unfilled.
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-055-005-34}}}Then the elder Śāradvatīputra, Mahā­maudgalyāyana, the elder Kauṣṭhila, Mahā­kātyāyana, Mahā­kāśyapa, the venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra, and the elder Subhūti—all those great hearers—turned to the youthful Mañjuśrī and asked, “Mañjuśrī, where is the Thus-Gone One right now? What does his body look like? How is he present?”
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-055-005-390}}}The youthful Mañjuśrī replied to the great hearers, “Venerable ones, you are great hearers, and you possess insight and miraculous abilities. You are powerful and mighty, you have mastered the absorptions of the erudite, and you have long observed pure conduct. Venerable ones, you should enter your own absorptions and search for the Thus-Gone One’s body and his presence. You should strive to discover where the Thus-Gone One’s body is, what his body is like, and how he is present.”
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-055-005-36}}}Thereupon the hearers settled into their own absorptions and investigated this entire trichiliocosm. They looked, but they still could not see the Thus-Gone One’s body, {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-055-005-410,folio:F.234.a}}} nor could they see his presence. Then, when the great hearers did not see the Thus-Gone One’s body nor his presence upon completely investigating the trichiliocosm, they arose from their respective absorptions and addressed the youthful Mañjuśrī as follows: “Mañjuśrī, we fail to see the Thus-Gone One’s body or his presence.”
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-055-005-391}}}Mañjuśrī replied to the great hearers, “Then all you venerable great hearers must silently join your palms and one-pointedly hold the Thus-Gone One in your mind for a moment. Do this, and you will see his body and witness his presence.”
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-055-005-38}}}Just then, the Blessed One, who was aware and cognizant of this, emerged from his absorption. As soon as the Blessed One emerged from his absorption, the entire trichiliocosm shook in six ways, with eighteen signs: it quivered, trembled, and quaked; it wobbled, rocked, and swayed; it vibrated, shuddered, and reeled; it rattled, shook, and convulsed; it clattered, rattled, and clanged; and it boomed, thundered, and roared. The world became exceedingly brilliant, open, and vivid.
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-055-005-39}}}As an offering to the Blessed One, a rain of divine flowers fell to the accompaniment of divine cymbals and song. At that point venerable Śāradvatīputra arose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and asked, {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-055-005-411,folio:F.234.b}}} “Blessed One, in what kind of absorption did you abide so that even the eye of insight of the great hearers was unable to see the Thus-Gone One’s body? Blessed One, what is the Thus-Gone One’s presence like?”
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-055-005-40}}}The Blessed One replied to venerable Śāradvatīputra, “Śāradvatīputra, this absorption is not a stage of the hearers or solitary buddhas. Śāradvatīputra, it is on the level of the thus-gone ones. This magical display and miracle of the buddhas is inconceivable. Nevertheless, Śāradvatīputra, listen well and keep this in mind. I will now teach you a little bit about the body of the Thus-Gone One.”
“Very well, Blessed One!” Venerable Śāradvatīputra replied, and he listened as the Blessed One had instructed.
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-055-005-42}}}Then the Blessed One explained to him, “Śāradvatīputra, the true body of the Thus-Gone One transcends any view, like the sky. It is incorporeal, uncreated, unborn, and unceasing. It is nonoccurring, truly nonoccurring, and utterly nonoccurring. It is unobtained, unimputed, nonengaging, unestablished, boundless, and limitless. It is peaceful, placid, and absolutely serene. It is nonabiding, nonarising, ineffable, beyond mind, and beyond origination. It is unmoving, utterly unmoving, and free of movement. It is totally pure. It is nothing whatsoever and exists in no way. It is beyond appropriation and acceptance. It is without motion, without activity, and without support. It is unborn, unarisen, without action, and without ripening. It is unseen, unheard, uncognized, detached, not bound, and not released. It does not exist. It is not recalled, not held, not experienced, and not seen. {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-055-005-412,folio:F.235.a}}} It is beyond cognition, is not an object of cognition, and is characterized by absence of cognition.
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-055-005-43}}}“It is without mind. It is unfathomable and unimaginable. It is not mind. It is devoid of mind. It possesses the mind of sameness. Nothing is the same as it, and it cannot be comprehended by any act of mind. It has not gone anywhere, does not go anywhere, is without going, and has eliminated any going. It is uninterrupted, immeasurable, uninterruptible, boundless, unobservable, and marvelous. It has no substance and is no substance. It is insubstantial. It is not a distinction and has no distinctions. It is nonarising, truly nonarising, unshakable, nondiscursive, nonconceptual, beginningless, unestablished, and wholly unestablished. It is not accomplished, without pervasion, and motionless. It is not clear, not tangible, and not a thing to be desired. It has no light and does not appear. It is not apprehended and has no appearance. It is without darkness, is not darkness, and is free of darkness. It is not lucidity. It is without abode and free of abode. It is not at peace, by no means at peace, without peace, and free from peace. It is the same as peace. It is pure, totally pure, and wholly pure.
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-055-005-44}}}“It is nothing whatsoever, beyond appropriation, and without perpetuation. It is without friendship, without strife, and free from strife. It is present through its way of not being present. It is without ties, free from ties, limpid, and unsullied. It does not die or take rebirth. It will not die or take rebirth. It is without Dharma and without non-Dharma. It is without a field, and also without anything other than a field. It is inexhaustible, not something that can be exhausted, and free from exhaustion. It is without dust, instantaneous, and unshakable. It is beyond syllables, sounds, tones, explanations, trainings, and mind. It is without logic and not illogical, and it is not separate from logic. It does not possess anything and is without possession. It is also not destitute. It is inexhaustible, {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-055-005-413,folio:F.235.b}}} not inexhaustible, immortal, and not immortal.
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-055-005-45}}}“It is not something to be pacified. It is without marks, not something without marks, not limited, not unlimited, and not something to be measured. It has not gone and has not come. It is nondual and not nondual. It is not perceived, not here, and not there. It is baseless, without abode, nonemerging, indestructible, nontransferable, and nothing to be heard. It does not conquer enemies. It accepts nothing and rejects nothing. It is without characteristics, free of characteristics, not a characteristic itself, and it has abandoned characteristics. It is without action and not without action. It is without marks, not without marks, and adorned with marks. It is gateless, unattached, and free from attachments. It inspires faith. It is without connections and free from connections. It causes delight and it causes bliss. It is freed from the six sense sources and invisible.
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-055-005-46}}}“It is reality—thoroughly distinguished by suchness. It is suchness, which liberates beings by not liberating. It liberates by not liberating sentient beings. It purifies sentient beings by way of not purifying. It protects sentient beings by way of not protecting. It teaches the Dharma to sentient beings by way of nonduality. Nothing is the same as it, it is incomparable, without likeness, and peerless. It is the same as that which is not present, the same as space, and the same as that which does not remain. It is exceedingly even, unborn, and the same as unborn. It does not apprehend and is the same as nonapprehension. It is not at peace, is free from peace, and its peace has waned. It is at peace, very much at peace, and thoroughly at peace. It is gentle, supple, utterly stainless, utterly controlled, not permanent, and not interrupted. It has withdrawn from activities. It is irreversibly brave. It has vanquished fear. It is beyond return. {{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-055-005-414,folio:F.236.a}}} It has severed all grasping and cut through all ties.
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-055-005-47}}}“It is clear, without distinctions, nondual, free from duality, and taught to be without any duality. Its essence being unproduced, its nature is luminosity that is utterly beyond occurring. Without any liberation, it is liberated from activity. It is without meeting, without separating, not long, not short, not round, not square, not spherical, and not substantial. It is not perceived as the aggregates, elements, or sense sources. It cannot be established as something conditioned, nor does it emerge from the unconditioned. It is nonwaxing, nonwaning, nonaccumulating, and unborn. No one can see it, hear it, or be conscious of it. It is neither real nor unreal. It is unborn. It does not die or transmigrate. It does not coexist with the world, nor does it not coexist with the world.
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-055-005-48}}}“That body is unwavering, unmistaken, unexcited, motionless, and undeviating. It is without cultivation and free from cultivation. It is nonoccurring, not destroyed, not an essence, and not without essence. It is without mind and indescribable. It is without connection and does not connect, nor does it not connect. It has no attachment to desires, nor is it without attachment to desires. It is nothing and it is not nothing. It is without characteristics and is not without characteristics. It does not transcend suffering and has not fully transcended suffering. It is not present, but it is not without presence, either. Śāradvatīputra, can sentient beings who fixate on characteristics and who have fallen into dualistic perception possibly understand the way in which the body of the Thus-Gone One abides?”
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-055-005-392}}}“No, Blessed One, they cannot at all,” replied Śāradvatīputra. “That is impossible. {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-055-005-415,folio:F.236.b}}} And why? Because, Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One’s body is free of any and all marks.”
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-055-005-50}}}“Śāradvatīputra, yes, that is correct. That is how it is,” the Blessed One agreed. “The Thus-Gone One’s body is free from any and all marks.”
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-055-005-393}}}The Blessed One then proceeded to teach extensively about the absorption of the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal. In order to be comprehensive and thorough, he spoke these verses:
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-055-005-52}}}“This body is not a body, and it is completely free from a body.
Nobody has created it, nobody destroys it, and no one obtains it.
It is absolutely bereft of properties, yet it is not bereft.
Such are the terms applied to the body of the blissful ones.
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-055-005-53}}}“It is without meeting, parting, abode, or substance.
It is neither grasped, nor freed, nor even, nor is it long.
It has no beginning, no impediment, nor is it present anywhere at all.
This is how the body of the blissful ones is explained.
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-055-005-54}}}“It is not grasped, is not made, has no place, and is nothing at all.
It has no form and no mind, and it is neither two nor one.
It is unreal, not unreal, and not nonoccurring.
The body of the victorious ones is like this in its true state.
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-055-005-55}}}“It is without a core, not weak, and not interrupted.
It is not disrupted, nonoccurring, unoriginated, and without destruction.
It is without obtainment, purified of dust, and not destroyed.
The body of the stainless ones should be understood like this.
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-055-005-56}}}“It is not seen, heard, held, or touched.
It is not perceived and not analyzed; rather, it is like a hallucination.
When beings see it, they are delighted to apprehend it.
This is how the body of the buddhas is taught to be.
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-055-005-57}}}“It is not an aggregate, not an element, not false, and not true.
It is not pure, utterly not pure, and not encountered by the senses.
It is without concepts, utterly nonconceptual, and like the moon in water.
This is how we should hold the body of the blissful ones to be.
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-055-005-58}}}“Since this body comes from causes and conditions, it has no intrinsic nature.
It is unborn, unceasing, not going, and unmoving.
Under analysis, the three worlds appear like an illusion. {{page:{number:14,id:UT22084-055-005-416,folio:F.237.a}}}
The body of the victorious ones must be seen nonconceptually like this.
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-055-005-59}}}“It has no peace, is not at peace, is free from peace, and unconnected.
It is without desire, without reason, and like an empty hand.
Moreover, it is naturally spacious.
Seeing it thus, one honors the Buddha day and night.
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-055-005-60}}}“You might fill billions of realms with jewels,
All the way up to the peak of existence,
And offer it to the buddhas until the end of time.
Yet that generosity cannot compare to copying this sūtra.
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-055-005-61}}}“You might cultivate loving kindness with equanimity toward all beings
For as many eons as there are grains of sand in the Ganges.
Yet that discipline cannot match the patience of someone
Who feels confidence in the supreme absorption of the wisdom seal.
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-055-005-62}}}“You might have forbearance toward every being for as many eons
As have passed in the infinity of cyclic existence.
Yet if you develop a single moment of trust in this seal of the victorious ones,
The former merit, compared to this, will seem like a mustard seed next to Mount Meru.
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-055-005-63}}}“You might honor as many beings as there are in the three worlds,
By carrying them over your head for many eons,
Without ever feeling tired or bothered.
Still, such diligence cannot compare to this patience.
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-055-005-64}}}“You might practice concentration for more eons
Than there are dust motes in a hundred buddha realms.
Still, compared to applying yourself to this sūtra for a single day,
That merit is no match for this patience.
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-055-005-65}}}“You might persevere in the insight that abandons the two extremes
For as many countless eons as there are particles in the world.
Still, if anyone realizes this wisdom, just as I have taught,
The former merit, compared to this, will seem like a drop of water next to the ocean.
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-055-005-66}}}“When it comes to the Victorious One, do not look for forms or features.
Do not regard the Blissful One as would a child.
Whoever sees me as Subhūti sees me
Trains in every kind of generosity found anywhere in the trichiliocosm.”
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-055-005-67}}}After the Blessed One had spoken these verses, he continued to address the elder Śāradvatīputra: {{page:{number:15,id:UT22084-055-005-417,folio:F.237.b}}} “Śāradvatīputra, this absorption of the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal is the perfection of the stainless wisdom vision of all bodhisattvas in the worlds throughout the ten directions. Śāradvatīputra, whoever wants to see the blessed buddhas should train in this absorption with an altruistic intention. Such bodhisattvas, practicing with altruistic intention, are able to see the Thus-Gone One within the course of just a single day.
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-055-005-68}}}“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattvas who desire to see the blessed buddhas in all the buddha realms of the ten directions should train day and night in this absorption. When bodhisattvas apply themselves with altruistic intention, they come to see the blessed buddhas in all the buddha realms of the ten directions. Śāradvatīputra, this absorption of the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal accomplishes the dhāraṇī Dharma method that brings about infinite gateways for bodhisattvas. It is the basis for all dhāraṇī gateways. From it the dhāraṇī gateways emerge. This absorption will bring about for bodhisattvas their great being’s thirty-two marks and complete their eighty excellent signs.

Six trillion eight hundred billion bodhisattvas purified the karmic obscurations accumulated over a hundred thousand eons and their progress toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening became irreversible. All of them attained the dhāraṇī called accomplishing the inexhaustible moment. Six quintillion gods and humans who had previously failed to arouse the mind set upon unsurpassed and perfect awakening now aroused this mind and rejoiced in this absorption. Due to the roots of virtue resulting from rejoicing in this absorption, their progress toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening became irreversible. Then the Blessed One prophesied that after three million eons, all of them would become thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect buddhas known as Fearless One. {{page:{number:19,id:UT22084-055-005-421,folio:F.239.b}}} Some among them would, after having made aspirations for a long time, accomplish patience.

Not dwelling on any phenomenon, you must maintain this accomplishment of unsurpassed and perfect awakening over many countless quadrillions of eons.

Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and said, “Blessed One, since there are no phenomena to be grasped, I am happy to maintain and protect this unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Blessed One, as for awakening, it is nothing at all. It comes from nowhere. It is found nowhere. It does not come about through anything. It is nothing whatsoever. It does not appear.

As for the other bodhisattvas, they are incorrigibly attached to grasping at objective perceptions. They will not uphold the holy Dharma. In the future, during the final five hundred years, they will abandon my unsurpassed and perfect awakening, which I have accomplished over countless quadrillions of eons. They will go against it.

Maitreya, bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening in seven ways. {{page:{number:21,id:UT22084-055-005-423,folio:F.240.b}}} What are these seven? Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening inspired by the blessed buddhas. Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening in order to protect the holy Dharma when that holy Dharma is disappearing. Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening when they feel great compassion on seeing the realms of beings afflicted by so many pains. Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening inspired by other bodhisattvas. Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening themselves when they have respectfully given beautiful gifts to bodhisattvas who have aroused the mind of awakening. Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening when they see others arouse the mind of awakening. Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening on hearing perfect praises sung about the qualities of the various ornaments of the thus-gone ones’ body, such as the excellent marks and signs. Maitreya, these are the seven ways in which bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening.
{{milestone:{label:1.75,id:UT22084-055-005-97}}}“Maitreya, as I have just mentioned, there are those bodhisattvas who arouse the mind of awakening because of the blessed buddhas, and those bodhisattvas who arouse the mind of awakening in order to preserve the holy Dharma at a time when it is disappearing, and those bodhisattvas who arouse the mind of awakening due to feelings of great compassion caused by witnessing the realms of sentient beings afflicted with all kinds of suffering. Maitreya, those bodhisattvas who arouse the mind of awakening in these three ways are maintaining the blessed buddhas’ awakening. Their progress toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening quickly becomes irreversible. The four other ways of arousing the mind of awakening are for incorrigible bodhisattvas who do not uphold the holy Dharma.

They have the same attitude toward all sentient beings. They do not envy the success and prestige of others. Even if their lives are threatened, they will speak nothing but praise of monks who uphold the sacred Dharma. They are not attached to worldly success sought through knowledge of the Dharma, nor to acquisitions, prestige, or compliments. They are devoted to the profound Dharma, and without interest in any kind of mundane activity keep the profound Dharma with them in all situations. Maitreya, if bodhisattvas possess these five qualities, know that their progress will be irreversible.
{{milestone:{label:1.77,id:UT22084-055-005-99}}}“Maitreya, if bodhisattvas possess five other qualities, know them to be incorrigible. What are the five? They have little charisma and do not follow any advice. They are interested in base things and give degraded teachings to others. They are attached to worldly success sought through knowledge of the Dharma, acquistions, and prestige, and behave enviously in the patron’s household. They are fraudulent and deceitful. Their verbal professions do not lead toward emptiness. Maitreya, if bodhisattvas possess these five qualities, know them to be incorrigible.

They do not regard the Thus-Gone One’s body as having the characteristics of form. Maitreya, if bodhisattvas possess these five qualities, know that they will not regress from unsurpassed and perfect awakening.”
{{milestone:{label:1.79,id:UT22084-055-005-379}}}Then the Blessed One spoke the following verses:
