{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-045-001-29}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing at Śrāvasti, where he had observed the summer retreat. After the three months of summer had passed, he prepared his Dharma robes. Once he had prepared his Dharma robes, he put on the robes, took up his alms bowl, and, together with one hundred thousand monks and eight hundred million bodhisattvas, proceeded toward the city of Vaiśālī. On the way, the Blessed One entered a large forest, where he later arose from meditative seclusion.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-045-001-30}}}The bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-045-001-13857,folio:F.2.a}}} who had also entered meditative seclusion, now likewise reemerged from this state. He and the whole assembly of monks, nuns, male lay practitioners, female lay practitioners, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahorāgas were now seated on their mats. All of the assembled bodhisattvas had attained illumination, dhāraṇī, and absorption. They were endowed with the five superknowledges, their words were engaging, and they were free from pretense, had no worldly ambitions, and were free from attachment. They taught the Dharma without any regard for material things. They had perfected acceptance of the profound Dharma, had accomplished fearlessness, and were beyond the actions of the māras. They had shed karmic obscurations, achieved the state free from any doubt about the nature of the Dharma, and accumulated aspirations throughout countless eons. They had smiles on their faces, spoke straightforwardly, and never frowned. They communicated in melodious voices, their minds were indomitable, and the flow of their eloquence was unbroken. They had achieved acceptance of equality. They were able to outshine infinite gatherings without any fear. They were adept at elaborating on a single word throughout ten million eons.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-045-001-31}}}They were confident that all phenomena are just like illusions, a mirage, the moon in water, dreams, and echoes. Their minds were endowed with infinite fearlessness, and they were confident in knowing the most subtle movements in the minds of sentient beings, as well as every aspect of their conduct. They possessed vast virtue {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-045-001-13858,folio:F.2.b}}} and their minds were unimpeded. They were free from exaggerating pride and endowed with patience. Their virtues were genuinely comprehensive. Their aspirations encompassed infinite arrays of buddha realms. They constantly manifested the absorption of recollecting the buddhas of countless world systems. They were skilled in supplicating boundless buddhas. They were skilled in quelling differing views, as well as latent tendencies and the fetters of emotional defilements. They were skilled in accomplishing hundreds of thousands of displays through absorption. They included the bodhisattva Maitreya, as well as the youthful Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Sound of Thunder,{{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-045-001-32}}} Mind of Blooming Flowers of a Hundred Thousand Virtues, Possessor of the Mind of Infinite Practice and the Speech That Is Adorned with Flashes of Lightning, Possessor of the Mind of Complete Detachment, King of Renown, Perceiver of the Agreeable and the Disagreeable, King of the Splendid Light of Deep Accumulations of Gold, Seeing and Moving Across a Hundred Yojanas, Heaps of Eloquence, Mass of Wisdom, Amoghadarśin, Bhadrapāla, the Eight Holy Beings,{{note:{index:23,id:UT22084-045-001-33}}} Gandhahastin, Jewel Treasury, Heaps of Insight, Array of Offerings, King of the Melodious Lion’s Roar, Adorned with Arrays of Wisdom, Moving with the Gait of a Lion, Fearless in Limitless Mastery of Eloquence, the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja, and others.
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-045-001-34}}}From the world systems of the great trichiliocosm came the Four Great Kings, Śakra, Brahmā, Īśvara, Mahābrahmā, {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-045-001-13859,folio:F.3.a}}} nāga leaders, yakṣa leaders, asura leaders, garuḍa leaders, kinnara leaders, mahorāga leaders, and gandharva leaders, arriving in the presence of the Blessed One, scattering flowers before him, and then taking their places in the gathering. 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-045-001-35}}} At that time, the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja observed seven days of fasting during which he would either stand or sit upright, practicing with unrelenting diligence, free from drowsiness and without sleep. It was then that the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja spoke to the Blessed One: “Which quality must bodhisattvas perfect in order for them to know the thoughts and conduct of all sentient beings, to apply the words that have the intent of all the buddhas, to avoid teaching based on incorrect teachings, to follow knowledge grounded in truth as literally expressed, and to become free of any obscuration with respect to all the buddhas of the present? Through which quality may they be able to accompany and perceive the buddhas, achieve certainty through the Dharma, follow the ways of the world without becoming stained by the world, abide in meditative attainments without taking birth in the corresponding realms, practice the Dharma of nirvāṇa without transcending suffering, and practice the Dharma of hearers and solitary buddhas in which the aspirations of buddhahood are not perfected, without achieving deliverance through those vehicles? Through which quality may their minds be unclouded in recollecting the buddhas, may they engage with the different dispositions and also be in accord with them all, not become overpowered by any question or eloquence, {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-045-001-13860,folio:F.3.b}}} apprehend all the infinite displays of the buddha realms, attain all forms of insight, bring sentient beings to maturation without adhering to the notion of ‘sentient being,’ teach the Dharma yet not fixate on any objective references, explain nirvāṇa yet not objectify this peacefulness in any way, act for the sake of awakening without fixation, and give up existence, as well as no existence, but aspire to what is vast? Blessed One, I do not ask in this way without any knowledge. Nevertheless, please explain.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-045-001-36}}}Then the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja spoke these verses:

{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-045-001-49}}}The Blessed One then spoke to the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja: “Excellent, Prāmodyarāja, excellent!

Furthermore, they perfect one hundred and twenty-one perfections. They attain eighty-four thousand absorptions and eighty-four thousand dhāraṇīs.

They rose, joined their palms in veneration, and facing in the direction of the Blessed One, they all spoke with one voice: “In the future time of repression—when Dharma teachers are disparaged and the wisdom of omniscience is denied, when the teachings are destroyed and the vision of wisdom is slight, when virtuous factors disintegrate and the means of livelihood vanish—we shall relinquish concern for our own body and life, and cut through all that is held to be pleasurable, as if with a sword. The path of the thus-gone ones, the seal of the flawless rich treasures of eloquence, the ocean that brings together the roots of virtue, and the dhāraṇīs that subdue the māras and accomplish omniscience are conveyed in discourses such as this one.

The thousands of bodhisattvas likewise all attained this absorption. The teaching brought delight to one million gods, future teachers of the Dharma, who thus proceeded irreversibly to awakening. Seven billion gods purified the Dharma eye that regards all phenomena. One hundred and eighty million members of the fourfold retinue of humans attained the Dharma eye that regards all phenomena. {{page:{number:32,id:UT22084-045-001-13887,folio:F.17.a}}} All of the three lower realms were thoroughly pacified. The light of the Blessed One lit up as many world realms in the ten directions as there are grains of sand in the Gaṅgā. At that moment happiness came to all sentient beings, from the summit of existence down to the Hell of Ultimate Torment. Out of the Blessed One’s light appeared trillions of lotuses, each with a hundred thousand petals and adorned with infinite jewels. Upon each of those flowers was a thus-gone one, just like the blessed Śākyamuni, surrounded by his retinue. Each of them received the supplication of Prāmodyarāja, and each one consequently taught this absorption, allowing innumerable sentient beings to proceed irreversibly to unexcelled and perfect awakening.

Chapter 2
{{milestone:{label:2.1,id:UT22084-045-001-189}}}The Blessed One then said this to the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja: “Prāmodyarāja, in this way you must devote yourself to generosity and make offerings to the Dharma. Prāmodyarāja, long ago, many incalculable eons in the past, there was a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a complete and perfect buddha known as Golden Beauty, King of the Splendid Light of Ascertainment. His lifespan was unfathomable, the features of his buddhafield were infinite, and his retinue was beyond count. 
{{milestone:{label:2.2,id:UT22084-045-001-190}}}“Later, during the final five hundred years of the teachings, there appeared a Dharma teacher by the name of Treasury of Engagement with the Infinite Jewel Body of Renown. When he taught this absorption all the other monks had completely strayed from the teachings. Nevertheless, this Dharma teacher was undeterred. Without concern for his own body and life, {{page:{number:33,id:UT22084-045-001-13888,folio:F.17.b}}} he inhabited charnel grounds, living from roots and fruits, and thus he taught this absorption. At that point, the gods from the Heaven of the Four Great Kings through to the Unexcelled Heaven came to listen to his teachings. At that time there was also a universal monarch known as Roar That Causes Widespread Happiness and Freedom from Pain, who came to listen to that Dharma teacher’s explanation of this absorption. When he had received the teaching, he gave the gift of freedom from terror as he said to the Dharma teacher, ‘Monk, please teach this absorption, which the buddhas have genuinely bestowed. I shall protect and take care of you.’
{{milestone:{label:2.3,id:UT22084-045-001-191}}}“The monarch arranged for one thousand of his sons to be the teacher’s guards, and with his boundless attitude he arranged for thirty thousand people to provide pleasant living conditions. Thus, living comfortably, the teacher taught this absorption for half an eon. Due to the roots of virtue resulting from this, the Dharma teacher, the king, his sons, and all the other people involved came together to please three billion buddhas over a period of eighty eons, and they received this absorption from each of them. In accordance with their wishes, they also took up residence in buddha realms. Prāmodyarāja, you may believe that teacher was someone else, but you should not think so. He was none other than the thus-gone Amitāyus. The universal monarch was the thus-gone Akṣobhya, and the one thousand princes are the thousand buddhas of the Good Eon. And, Prāmodyarāja, all the other thirty thousand bodhisattvas were the beings who provided for, protected, and sustained the Dharma teacher in accordance with his wishes. 
{{milestone:{label:2.4,id:UT22084-045-001-192}}}“Prāmodyarāja, since this is the absorption of the bodhisattvas, {{page:{number:34,id:UT22084-045-001-13889,folio:F.18.a}}} you must genuinely accomplish it.

{{milestone:{label:2.18,id:UT22084-045-001-209}}}Then eighty-four thousand Licchavis who were gathered inside Vaiśālī and another eighty-four thousand Licchavis who had assembled outside Vaiśālī thought to themselves, “In order to benefit many beings, in order bring happiness to many beings, and out of love for the world, the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha has appeared in the world in order to help gods and humans and bring them happiness. But now the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha has entered meditative seclusion. Who among us should now request that he rise from the absorption of the thus-gone ones?” 
{{milestone:{label:2.19,id:UT22084-045-001-210}}}The Licchavis who were assembled inside Vaiśālī went before the venerable Śāriputra and said, {{page:{number:36,id:UT22084-045-001-13891,folio:F.19.a}}} “Venerable Śāriputra, at the time when the lifespan is short, the appearance of a buddha is rare, and faith is also rare.

{{milestone:{label:2.20,id:UT22084-045-001-211}}}Upon hearing those words, the venerable Śāriputra went to the place where the Blessed One was residing. Yet, although Śāriputra searched for the Blessed One’s dwelling by entering meditative concentration and absorption, he could not discover the abode of the Thus-Gone One. 
{{milestone:{label:2.21,id:UT22084-045-001-212}}}The venerable Śāriputra then went to see the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, explaining to him about the intents and wishes of the Licchavis. In response, the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana applied his miraculous abilities, thus causing the entire trichiliocosm to tremble and shake, and his voice reverberated through the whole world below the Realm of Brahmā, requesting the Thus-Gone One to reemerge from absorption. Yet the Blessed One did not emerge.

Encircling the Blessed One, they took their seats. The Four Great Kings, Śakra who rules the gods, and innumerable gods of the desire realm arriving from the Heaven Free from Strife, {{page:{number:37,id:UT22084-045-001-13892,folio:F.19.b}}} the Heaven of Joy, the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, and the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations likewise reached where the Blessed One resided. They bowed their heads before the Blessed One’s feet and then stood to one side. Likewise, from the heavens of Brahmā, Luminosity, Perfected Virtue, Great Fruition, and all the way up to the pure abodes, innumerable gods arrived. They all paid respect to the Blessed One and took their places. 
{{milestone:{label:2.23,id:UT22084-045-001-214}}}By then the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja had dwelt undistractedly in meditative seclusion for seven days. When that period of seven days had passed, he began to discern and arose from meditative seclusion. Arriving at the courtyard where the Blessed One resided, he entered among the masterful bodhisattvas, bowed down, and then took his seat with his palms joined, facing the Blessed One.
{{milestone:{label:2.24,id:UT22084-045-001-215}}}Fully aware, the Blessed One now reemerged from his absorption. With the gaze of an elephant, he silently gazed upon the whole gathering.

{{milestone:{label:2.27,id:UT22084-045-001-218}}} The bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja now made the following request to the Blessed One: “Blessed One, while I resided alone in the forest in meditative seclusion, I thought, ‘These bodhisattvas gain true accomplishment for the sake of awakening. By means of the perfections they accumulate roots of virtue for the sake of awakening.’ But I wonder, Blessed One, do the perfections benefit sentient beings or are they beneficial for awakening—are the perfections defiled or are they undefiled? I request the Blessed One to please explain these matters at length so that the perfections may develop in the bodhisattvas; so that the Dharma ways of the bodhisattvas may be engendered and upheld in the beginning, middle, and end; and so that such skillful practices may become the source of abundant, supreme joy.”
{{milestone:{label:2.28,id:UT22084-045-001-219}}} The Blessed One replied, “Excellent, excellent, Prāmodyarāja! It is very good that you wish to question the Thus-Gone One about these matters, Prāmodyarāja. Indeed, you have posed this question to nine hundred million buddhas in the past. Therefore, Prāmodyarāja, listen very well and keep my words correctly in mind; I shall explain it to you.”

What need to speak of the hearers who follow the spoken word?
Unparalleled and incomparable,
Buddhahood is known to be inconceivable.

Are not inferior, and their practice is unparalleled.

At that time there was a king known as Flower of Merit. The king heard that thus-gone one’s teaching and proceeded to speak as follows to his one thousand queens and one thousand sons: ‘I do not know the meaning of this exhaustive illumination of absorption. I do not know it, and I fail to understand. Nevertheless, we shall rejoice in these fine statements of the Thus-Gone One.’
{{milestone:{label:2.C.1020,id:UT22084-045-001-4470}}} “As the king thus rejoiced in that blessed one’s excellent statements and explanations on this meditative absorption, he cast aside eighty thousand eons of saṃsāra and looked beyond. He attained the recollection called heavenly bodies, and he indeed became free from doubt with respect to this teaching of awakening. By the roots of virtue ensuing from that, he went on to please three hundred thousand buddhas, and from each of them he received this absorption. Never again would he descend into error or inopportune states. {{page:{number:674,id:UT22084-045-001-14529,folio:F.338.a}}} By this very cause, he accomplished perfect and complete buddhahood. He became perfectly and completely awakened.

At that point and at that time, the thus-gone Amitāyus was King Flower of Merit, and the thus-gone ones of this Good Eon were his one thousand sons. If simply rejoicing in this absorption has that much power, what can we say about reading this, receiving its scriptural transmission, and putting it into practice?
{{milestone:{label:2.C.1022,id:UT22084-045-001-4472}}} “Prāmodyarāja, once in the past there was a thus-gone one by the name of Nectar Joy whose retinue numbered hundreds of thousands. A universal monarch named Vast Mind offered that thus-gone one a palace shining with golden light, moistened by the sap of red sandalwood, and perfumed with the incense of myrobalan. For their enjoyment, he also offered each member of the saṅgha of monks the exact same gift. Moreover, he offered every one of them a pleasure garden. Thus, he came to hear this absorption from that blessed one. 
{{milestone:{label:2.C.1023,id:UT22084-045-001-4473}}} “He then said to the best among the scholars attending that blessed one, someone by the name of Perfect Insight, ‘I must understand this absorption. But doing so is difficult as long as one remains in a household. I must by all means shave off my hair and beard, go forth from the household, and become a homeless mendicant. There can be no doubt about this.’ He then did shave off his hair and beard, don the saffron-colored robes, go forth from the household, and become a homeless mendicant. All his ten thousand sons and eighty-four thousand queens went forth at the same time, wishing to receive the various aspects of this absorption. {{page:{number:675,id:UT22084-045-001-14530,folio:F.338.b}}} Knowing their thoughts, that blessed one proceeded to teach them this absorption in detail for a period of seven days. As they heard this teaching, they said to one another, ‘Alas, this absorption is difficult to behold. Nevertheless, we shall write this down carefully, and we shall uphold this.’ 
{{milestone:{label:2.C.1024,id:UT22084-045-001-4474}}}“Hence, they wrote down this absorption and made it their object of worship. They retained it and received its transmission. After they had passed away, they all came together again, and they pleased six hundred thousand buddhas. They kept hearing this absorption, and they all went forth and obtained this absorption. In accordance with their prayers and by these roots of virtue alone, they all attained awakening. 
{{milestone:{label:2.C.1025,id:UT22084-045-001-4475}}}“Prāmodyarāja, do not think that, at that point and at that time, the universal monarch named Vast Mind was someone else. The thus-gone Dīpaṅkara was at that point and on that occasion the universal monarch known as Vast Mind, and the thus-gone Vilocana was the monk and attendant by the name of Perfect Insight. His ten thousand sons will remain unable to reach awakening for thirty-five eons, counting from the present one. Then will follow an eon called Great Renown, and during that single eon all of them will awaken to perfect and complete buddhahood. After the eon called Great Renown is over, the eighty thousand ministers will remain unable to reach awakening for eighty eons. Then will follow an eon called Star-Like, during which those eighty thousand ministers will awaken to perfect and complete buddhahood. {{page:{number:676,id:UT22084-045-001-14531,folio:F.339.a}}} After the eon called Star-Like will follow three hundred eons during which no buddhas will appear. Then there will be an eon known as Array of Qualities, and during that time the eighty-four thousand queens will awaken to perfect and complete buddhahood. Prāmodyarāja, such are the fruits born by this absorption of the bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:{label:2.C.1026,id:UT22084-045-001-4476}}}“Prāmodyarāja, in this way the superior wishes of the bodhisattvas are fulfilled.

{{milestone:{label:2.C.1027,id:UT22084-045-001-4477}}}At that point the Blessed One spoke these verses:
“Those in pursuit of the buddhas’ awakening
Should train in the footsteps of those kings.

There is no way to achieve supreme awakening.

The ripening achieved will be sublime.

Engage in this spiritual practice with all manner of respect.

And who wish for extensive explanation,
Should, just as taught, take up this spiritual practice.

What need is there to mention the effects of holding and reading this?

Teaching, inspiring the minds of others,

{{milestone:{label:2.C.1038,id:UT22084-045-001-4489}}}When the Blessed One gave this Dharma teaching, innumerable bodhisattvas gave rise to the mind of unexcelled perfect and complete awakening, and they all irreversibly attained unexcelled perfect and complete awakening. Moreover, eight hundred thousand gods and humans attained the pure Dharma eye that beholds phenomena immaculately and without stain. Since the eyes of those gods were now pure, they delighted in the Blessed One’s Dharma and scattered flowers throughout this trichiliocosm. {{page:{number:678,id:UT22084-045-001-14533,folio:F.340.a}}} The trichiliocosm shook in six distinctive ways, and the sounds of divine drums filled the air.
