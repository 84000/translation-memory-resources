{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-062-017-17}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling on Vulture Peak in Rājagṛha, together with a large assembly of twelve hundred and fifty monks. Those monks, as well as nuns, male and female lay devotees, kings, ministers, brahmins, householders, various non-Buddhist ascetics, brahmins,{{note:{index:3,id:UT22084-062-017-18}}} practitioners, and renunciants, as well as gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas, worshiped, venerated, and honored the Blessed One. Through their offerings, the Blessed One obtained divine and human garments, food, bedding, medicines, and many excellent provisions. Nevertheless, just as water does not adhere to a lotus, desires do not sully the Blessed One. 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-062-017-19}}}Then, virtuous verses were heard that celebrated the Blessed One, declaring him a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfect buddha rich in knowledge and conduct, a sugata, one who knows the ways of the world, a supreme charioteer for people in need of taming, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, and a blessed one. Through his own intuition he gained direct and perfect insight into the world with its gods, with beings including Māra and Brahmā, renunciants and brahmins, and gods and humans. He also expounded the Dharma, and gave all beings instructions in proper spiritual conduct that were virtuous in the beginning, middle, and end; {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-062-017-271,folio:F.269.b}}} that were excellent in meaning and in expression; and that were uncontaminated and perfect, pure and unsullied.{{note:{index:4,id:UT22084-062-017-20}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-062-017-21}}}At that time, a householder named Śrīgupta lived in the city of Rājagṛha. He was a rich man—wealthy, prosperous, well-heeled, affluent, and comfortable. He owned money, grain, chattel, gems, pearls, lapis lazuli, conch shells, crystals, coral, silver, and much fine gold. He kept elephants, untamed stallions, many cows, male and female servants, workers, and laborers, and possessed many full treasuries. This householder, Śrīgupta—neither devout nor pious—had a low opinion of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. He had become a Jain follower, and was loyal to a Jain master named Jñātiputra.
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-062-017-22}}}One day, Śrīgupta went to visit Jñātiputra. Upon arriving, he bowed at Jñātiputra’s feet and sat to one side. When Śrīgupta was seated to one side, Jñātiputra said to him, “Householder, a certain young mendicant named Gautama, a novice renunciant, boasts of omniscience. You should know that he has deceived the whole world with his boast of omniscience. Therefore, householder, go and take the life of Gautama the mendicant. When he has met his end and died, the news will spread that the householder Śrīgupta killed the mendicant Gautama, who was renowned for his vast miraculous powers, and for his might and strength. Such a tremendous act of virtue will become famous through expositions, statements, and verses about you.”
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-062-017-23}}}Śrīgupta said, “Noble sir, how can I take the life of Gautama the mendicant?”
Jñātiputra the Jain replied, “Householder, {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-062-017-272,folio:F.270.a}}} go and dig a deep pit at the main entrance to your house. When you have dug it, light a fire in the pit and put a thin cover over it. Inside the house, prepare poisoned food. Once this is done, go to the mendicant Gautama and invite him for a meal. If Gautama is truly omniscient and all-seeing, you will not succeed. If he is not omniscient and all-seeing, you will succeed. Once he has fallen into the fire pit by the main gate, he and his followers will meet their end. If he somehow escapes, he will still meet his end when he eats the poisoned food inside the house. Do as I say.”
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-062-017-25}}}Having listened to the Jain Jñātiputra’s instructions, Śrīgupta rose from his seat, bowed at the Jain Jñātiputra’s feet, circumambulated him three times, left his presence, and returned to his own house. Upon arriving, he summoned his laborers and said, “Laborers, today dig a deep pit near the main gate. After you have dug it out, make a flameless and smokeless fire, and put a thin cover over the pit. Inside the house, prepare poisoned food.”
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-062-017-26}}}After assembling his laborers, Śrīgupta left Rājagṛha and set out for Vulture Peak, where the Blessed One was. When he arrived, they exchanged many pleasantries and had a satisfying conversation. He then sat to one side. 
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-062-017-27}}}While Śrīgupta was seated to one side, the Blessed One gave a Dharma discourse that was instructive, encouraging, uplifting, and joyous. After the Blessed One {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-062-017-273,folio:F.270.b}}} had given this Dharma discourse that was instructive, encouraging, uplifting, and joyous, Śrīgupta rose from his seat and asked him, “Gautama, would you please allow me to invite you for the midday meal tomorrow, together with your community of śrāvakas?”
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-062-017-28}}}The Blessed One thought, “Śrīgupta seeks to treat me like this because he has come under the influence of a wicked spiritual friend. But he will soon turn to the pure topics set out in the Dharma and Vinaya.”
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-062-017-29}}}Knowing this, the Blessed One accepted the invitation by not saying anything further to Śrīgupta. Śrīgupta understood that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent. He then raised his arm, lifted his index finger, and thought, “So he does not even know what I am thinking, and is certainly not all-knowing! The mendicant Gautama has deceived the whole world with his boasts of omniscience.”
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-062-017-30}}}The householder Śrīgupta then circumambulated the Blessed One three times and departed from his presence to return to his own house. He had a deep pit dug by the main gate, filled it with a flameless and smokeless fire, and put a thin cover over it. Inside the house he had poisoned food prepared.
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-062-017-31}}}At that time, Śrīgupta was married to the daughter of Anāthapiṇḍada. When Śrīgupta’s wife saw him making such preparations, she said to him, “If someone were hostile toward the Lord Buddha, this is how they would try to kill him.”
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-062-017-32}}}Śrīgupta replied, “Lady, you should know that the mendicant Gautama, {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-062-017-274,folio:F.271.a}}} a novice renunciant, is boasting of omniscience. With his boast of omniscience, he has deceived the whole world. Hence, this is how I am trying to kill him.”
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-062-017-33}}}His wife said, “You will regret it when you fail to kill the blessed Lord. Why? Because he is a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfect buddha.”
Then Śrīgupta thought, “My wife is a servant of the Śākyas—she will spill the secret!” 
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-062-017-35}}}He grabbed her by the hair, dragged her inside the house, and locked the door. With the door locked, he invited the Blessed One for lunch: “Gautama, it is time for the midday meal.”
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-062-017-36}}}The Blessed One said to Venerable Ānanda, “Go and get a fan. Then go from dwelling to dwelling and tell the senior monks that the Blessed One says, ‘No monk should enter the house of Śrīgupta ahead of me.’ Issue this instruction.”
“Very well, Blessed One.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-062-017-38}}}Ānanda then did as he was told. Carrying a fan, he approached the monks and told them, “Venerable sirs, the Blessed One issues the following instruction: ‘No monk should enter the house of Śrīgupta ahead of me.’ ”
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-062-017-39}}}In the morning, the Blessed One put on his lower garment and outer robe, took his alms bowl, and in the company of a devout group of monks, descended from Vulture Peak.
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-062-017-40}}}Then Brahmā Sahāmpati, surrounded by a devout group of gods from the Realm of Brahmā, approached the Blessed One, {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-062-017-275,folio:F.271.b}}} bowed at his feet, and walked on his right side. The lord of the gods, Śakra, surrounded by a devout group of gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, approached the Blessed One, bowed his head at his feet, and walked on his left side.
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-062-017-41}}}The four great kings—Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Virūḍhaka, Virūpākṣa, and Vaiśravaṇa—surrounded by many thousands of devout yakṣas, walked behind the Blessed One. The great king Vaiśravaṇa carried the Blessed One’s parasol. The twenty-eight great yakṣa generals approached the Blessed One, bowed at his feet, and walked behind him. Heavenly musicians walked in front of him, dancing, singing, and playing loud music.
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-062-017-42}}}At that time, rain fell in front of the Blessed One, while the sun shone from behind him and a cloud hovered overhead. Wherever the Blessed One set foot, the gods showered him with sandalwood powder, again and again. They showered him repeatedly with heavenly flowers, including blue and white water lilies, red and white lotuses, and mandārava blossoms.
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-062-017-43}}}The Blessed One then arrived in the great city of Rājagṛha. Now, it is in the nature of buddhas, blessed ones, to perform miracles whenever they enter a city; they never do so without performing a miracle. When the Blessed One {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-062-017-276,folio:F.272.a}}} first set his golden-colored right foot on the threshold of Rājagṛha, Rājagṛha shook in six ways. It shook, shifted, and shuddered; it trembled, quivered, and quaked. When the east rose, the west sank. When the west rose, the east sank. When the south rose, the north sank. When the north rose, the south sank. When the center rose, the periphery sank. When the periphery rose, the center sank.
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-062-017-44}}}As soon as the Blessed One had set his golden-colored right foot on the threshold of Rājagṛha, the gods showered him with heavenly sandalwood powder, again and again. They showered him repeatedly with heavenly flowers, including blue and white water lilies, red and white lotuses, and mandārava blossoms. The sound of divine music resonated in the sky, accompanied by the ringing of heavenly cymbals.
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-062-017-45}}}At the very instant the Blessed One set his golden-colored left foot on the threshold of the great city of Rājagṛha, the eyes of those who were blind could see forms. The ears of those who were deaf could hear. Those who lacked a sense of smell became perfectly able to smell, and those who were mute began to speak. People gripped by memory loss were freed from forgetfulness, and those who were insane came to their senses. People who had ingested poison were cured of its effects. Those held fast in captivity were released from their imprisonment. People who regarded each other as enemies became fond of each other. 
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-062-017-46}}}Cymbals resounded without being struck, and drums resonated without being played. {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-062-017-277,folio:F.272.b}}} Mighty bulls bellowed, elephants trumpeted, and horses neighed. All the birds that lived near the gate to the city of Rājagṛha—geese, cranes, peacocks, parrots, mynas, cuckoos, pheasants, and partridges—called out with their own songs, and flocked to surround the gate to Rājagṛha. 
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-062-017-47}}}Within Rājagṛha, men, women, boys, and girls watched from pavilions, town houses, ledges, vestibules, and windows, scattering flower petals upon the Blessed One. All the people of Rājagṛha were amazed and filled with wonder and joy. They shouted at the top of their voices, laughed loudly, and exclaimed their wonder and awe. They even tossed clothes to the Blessed One.
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-062-017-48}}}The Blessed One then entered Rājagṛha and went to the house of Śrīgupta. A lay devotee who saw the Blessed One arriving from afar thought, “If Śrīgupta intends to carry out such an act against the Blessed One, will the Blessed One not be killed? Will the Eye of the World not be swiftly destroyed? Will a great darkness not swiftly descend upon the world? Will the Buddha, who trained for three immeasurable eons, not swiftly fade from the world? Will our current enjoyment of the Dharma not swiftly wane?”
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-062-017-49}}}The lay devotee then approached the Blessed One and bowed at his feet. He circumambulated him, knelt on his right knee, {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-062-017-278,folio:F.273.a}}} bowed to the Blessed One with his palms joined, and said, “Noble sir, Blessed One, please do not go to the house of Śrīgupta. Why not? Noble sir, Blessed One, Śrīgupta had a deep pit dug at his main gate in order to kill you and the monastic community. He then filled it with a flameless and smokeless fire and put a thin cover over it. I wonder, if he does all this, will he not cause some harm to the Blessed One and his followers?”
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-062-017-50}}}The Blessed One replied, “Lay brother, do not think that way. Lay brother, fire could not physically affect me even when I was born as an animal; how much less so now that I am a completely awakened buddha? I have extinguished the three fires of attachment, anger, and delusion, so there is no basis for fire to physically affect me.”
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-062-017-51}}}“Noble sir, Blessed One, how was it that fire did not physically affect you when you were born as an animal?”
The Blessed One replied, “Lay brother, in a former time there lived a certain king of Kaliṅga. This king lit a large fire in order to kill the wild animals on the island of Begburchepa. The blaze upset all the animals and birds that lived on Begburchepa—those that flew through the sky, walked on land, or swam in the water. Those that could fly escaped into the sky, those that could swim dove into the water, and those on land ran to and fro to get away.
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-062-017-54}}}“On the island of Begburchepa there lived a partridge chick {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-062-017-279,folio:F.273.b}}} whose wings had not yet matured. The mother partridge dipped her feathers into the water and sprinkled it around the chick. She then hurriedly repeated this, over and over again.
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-062-017-55}}}“The partridge chick watched his mother struggling in this way, and then asked her, ‘Mother, why are you struggling in this way?’
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-062-017-56}}}“She replied, ‘Child, you should know that the king of Kaliṅga has lit a large fire to kill all the animals on the island of Begburchepa. The blaze has disturbed all the animals and birds who live on the island of Begburchepa, whether they fly through the sky, walk on the land, or swim in the water. Those that can fly have escaped into the sky, those that can swim have dived into the water, and those on land have run to and fro to get away. I am struggling in this way for your sake, because I think that you will burn.’
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-062-017-57}}}“The chick replied, ‘Mother, stop it, stop it! You are foolish. Such efforts will never save me from the blaze. Mother, draw on all your power and strength, carefully carry me to a high spot among the trees on the island of Begburchepa, and put me down there. Please do this!’
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-062-017-58}}}“The mother partridge did as her child asked. She drew on all her own strength, carefully carried the partridge chick, and put it down in a high spot among the trees on the island of Begburchepa.
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-062-017-59}}}“When the partridge chick saw the great blaze, it was filled with compassion and spoke this verse:
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-062-017-60}}}“ ‘There are legless beings,
And also winged ones and those with legs.
May their parents place them in protection!
May the noxious fire not return!’
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-062-017-61}}}“Lay brother, {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-062-017-280,folio:F.274.a}}} as soon as the partridge chick uttered this verse, the fire died down, retreating to where it had been lit. That is why, from that day to this, fire has never broken out on the island of Begburchepa. Lay brother, if you suspect or have doubts that at that time on the island of Begburchepa the partridge chick with undeveloped wings was someone else, or are of two minds, reconsider. Lay brother, I was that partridge chick. Lay brother, fire could not physically affect me even then, when I was born as an animal; how much less so now that I am a completely awakened buddha? There is no basis for fire to physically affect me.”
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-062-017-62}}}The Blessed One then delivered a Dharma discourse to the lay devotee and the crowd of beings that was instructive, encouraging, uplifting, and joyous. After the Blessed One had delivered the Dharma discourse that was instructive, encouraging, uplifting, and joyous, he continued on his way.
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-062-017-63}}}Another lay devotee saw him arriving from afar and thought, “If Śrīgupta intends to carry out such an act against the Blessed One, will the Blessed One not be killed? Will the Sugata not be killed? Will the Eye of the World not be swiftly destroyed? Will a great darkness not swiftly descend upon the world? Will the Buddha, who trained for three immeasurable eons, not swiftly fade from the world? Will our current enjoyment of the Dharma not swiftly wane?”
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-062-017-64}}}The lay devotee then approached the Blessed One and bowed at his feet. He circumambulated him three times, knelt on both knees, bowed to the Blessed One with his palms joined, and said to the Blessed One, {{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-062-017-281,folio:F.274.b}}} “Noble sir, Blessed One, please do not go to the house of Śrīgupta. Why? Noble sir, Blessed One, Śrīgupta had a deep pit dug at his main gate in order to kill you and the monastic community. He then filled it with a flameless and smokeless fire and put a thin cover over it. I wonder, if he does all this, will he not cause some harm to the Blessed One and his followers?”

{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-062-017-66}}}“Noble sir, Blessed One, how was it that fire did not physically affect you when you were born as an animal?”
The Blessed One replied, “Lay brother, in a former time here in Jambudvīpa there was a wondrous pleasure park, a dense, verdant forest, abundant in flowers and fruits. In this forest lived a sage who had befriended a hare who could speak the human language. At one point a great drought befell the dense forest, which caused all the trees with leaves, blossoms, and fruit to wither. The pleasure groves in the forest entirely dried up. The sage went to visit the hare and told him, ‘Hare, you should know that a great drought has befallen this dense forest. All the trees with leaves, blossoms, {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-062-017-282,folio:F.275.a}}} and fruit have withered. The pleasure groves in the forest have entirely dried up. Hare, I wish to leave this dense forest for another one.’
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-062-017-68}}}“The hare replied, ‘Sage, please remain in this dense forest for one more day and allow me to feed you.’
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-062-017-69}}}“The sage then returned to his dwelling, made a fire, and performed a homa while reciting mantras.{{note:{index:5,id:UT22084-062-017-70}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-062-017-71}}}“Meanwhile, the hare wandered all over the forest, but he could not find fruits or roots anywhere. He thought, ‘I invited the sage to a meal, but even though I have traversed the entire forest, I have not found fruits or roots anywhere. Therefore, I will satiate the sage with my own flesh.’
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-062-017-72}}}“The hare then went to the sage and said, ‘Sage, please understand; I invited you for a meal, but even though I traversed the entire forest, I did not find fruits or roots anywhere.

{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-062-017-73}}}“The sage replied, ‘Hare, don’t do it! Don’t say that. I do not wish to harm you, hare, let alone to eat your flesh.’
“The hare said, ‘Sage, please don’t say that. Please carry out my wishes.’
{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-062-017-75}}}“Then the hare uttered the following words of truth:
“ ‘Great gods of this dense forest, please heed me! All nāgas and yakṣas, gandharvas and asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas who dwell here, please heed me! I am about to perform an act of giving, the greatest act of giving, an extreme act of giving—I am about to give myself. The truth and words of truth with which I give myself away {{page:{number:14,id:UT22084-062-017-283,folio:F.275.b}}} are these: “I do this not to be a king, nor for the sake of wealth or a higher rebirth. I do this not to attain the rank of Śakra, Māra, or Brahmā, nor to acquire the kingdom of a universal monarch. Rather, I do this in order to attain supreme and perfect awakening and reach perfect buddhahood, so that I may tame those beings who are not yet tamed, liberate those not yet liberated, reassure those who need reassurance, and place beyond suffering those who are still suffering.” By this truth, and by these words of truth, may my self-sacrifice not be fruitless!’
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-062-017-77}}}“With these words, he hurled himself into the large fire pit.
“Lay brother, as soon as the hare jumped into the fire pit, the fire within it died out and became a pool of lotuses. The hare was teaching the Dharma while seated on a thousand-petaled lotus that was buzzing with bees. He gave instructions in proper spiritual conduct that were virtuous in the beginning, middle, and end; that were excellent in meaning and in expression; and that were uncontaminated, perfect, pure, and unsullied.
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-062-017-79}}}“When the sage witnessed this, he was overjoyed and delighted, and so he rejoiced. Filled with joy and happiness, he joined the palms of his hands and bowed to the hare.
{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-062-017-80}}}“Lay brother, if you suspect or have doubts that the sage who lived at that time in that dense forest was someone else, reconsider.

{{milestone:{label:1.54,id:UT22084-062-017-81}}}The Blessed One then delivered a Dharma discourse to the lay devotee and the crowd of beings that was instructive, encouraging, uplifting, and joyous.
{{milestone:{label:1.55,id:UT22084-062-017-309}}}After the Blessed One had delivered the Dharma discourse that was instructive, encouraging, uplifting, and joyous, he continued on to the house of Śrīgupta. The crowd of people from the city of Rājagṛha thought, “What will happen? There is a pit at the main gate to Śrīgupta’s house.”
{{milestone:{label:1.56,id:UT22084-062-017-82}}}The Blessed One then reached the deep fire pit, and set his golden-colored right foot upon it. As soon as the Blessed One had set his golden-colored right foot upon the fire pit, the fire in the pit died out, and it became a pool of lotuses, buzzing with bees. As soon as the Blessed One had set his golden-colored right foot upon the fire pit, the gods showered heavenly sandalwood powder over him, showering him repeatedly with it. They showered him with heavenly flowers, such as blue and white water lilies, red and white lotuses, and mandārava blossoms, showering him repeatedly with them. Divine music rang out, and heavenly cymbals played. Conches, large drums, and clay and metal drums resounded. 
{{milestone:{label:1.57,id:UT22084-062-017-83}}}The people of the great city of Rājagṛha were amazed and full of wonder. They let out a great roar of acclaim and the loud sounds of jubilation, laughter, astonishment, and elation. They even tossed clothes to the Blessed One.
{{milestone:{label:1.58,id:UT22084-062-017-84}}}At that time Śrīgupta was standing on the roof of his house with Jñātiputra the Jain. Śrīgupta’s wife, who was inside the house, heard the roar and clamor erupting in Rājagṛha {{page:{number:16,id:UT22084-062-017-285,folio:F.276.b}}} and thought, “Does such a loud and powerful noise here in the city of Rājagṛha mean that the Blessed One did not fall into the large fire pit and die? Has the Sugata not died?”
{{milestone:{label:1.59,id:UT22084-062-017-85}}}With this thought, Śrīgupta’s wife worked to force open the door. She then ran straight to the main gate and saw that the fire inside the pit had died away, the pit had become a lotus lake, and the Blessed One had set foot upon a lotus buzzing with bees as he proceeded towards Śrīgupta’s house. She was delighted and overjoyed at this sight; and, filled with delight and happiness, she went to Śrīgupta and said, “Lord, the fire in the pit has gone out, and it has become a lotus lake. The Blessed One set foot on a lotus buzzing with bees, and then proceeded toward the house. Look, look!”

Monks, I was the brahmin boy named Dharmakāma at that time. Monks, if you suspect or have doubts that the brahmin who lived at that time was someone else, reconsider. The householder Śrīgupta was the brahmin at that time. Monks, at that time, I saved the householder Śrīgupta from falling into the great hells because of his wish to burn me in a fire pit and his being destined to fall into the great hells. I established him in the noble Dharma and Vinaya. This is how you should remember these things.

I have also established him in the noble Dharma and Vinaya. This is how you should remember these things.
