{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-060-001-30}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in the Samanta Assembly Hall in Śrāvastī together with a great saṅgha of 1,250 monks, innumerable bodhisattva mahāsattvas, and many hundreds of thousands of beings to be tamed, and other bodhisattva mahāsattvas headed by Avalokiteśvara. 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-060-001-32}}}The Blessed One sat unwavering upon a jeweled lion throne. Through the power of the Buddha, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mañjuśrī rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Joining his palms toward the Blessed One, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-060-001-301,folio:F.2.a}}} he said, “Blessed One, how extensive is the great merit of the Tathāgata’s Dharma conch,{{note:{index:10,id:UT22084-060-001-33}}} the great merit by which the wishes of the many hundred sextillions of beings to be tamed are completely fulfilled?”

The seven treasures are as follows: the precious wheel, the precious elephant, the precious horse, the precious jewel, the precious woman, the precious steward, and the precious minister.
