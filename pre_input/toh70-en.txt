{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-043-007-16}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was at the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana, by Rājagṛha, together with a great assembly of monks. At that time a bodhisattva great being named Subāhu set out with his servants from the city of Rājagṛha for the Kalandaka­nivāpa in the Veṇuvana, where the Blessed One was staying. As soon as he arrived, Subāhu touched his head to the feet of the Blessed One, circumambulated him three times, and sat down to one side. With palms joined, the bodhisattva great being Subāhu bowed to the Blessed One and asked him, “Blessed One, what are the qualities bodhisattva great beings should have if they are to awaken swiftly and completely to unsurpassed and perfect awakening?” 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-043-007-17}}}The Blessed One replied to the bodhisattva great being Subāhu as follows: “Subāhu, if bodhisattva great beings are to awaken swiftly and perfectly, they must constantly and relentlessly complete the six perfections. What are these six? They are the perfection of generosity, the perfection of ethical discipline, the perfection of patience, the perfection of diligence, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-043-007-428,folio:F.154.b}}} the perfection of concentration, and the perfection of insight. Subāhu, bodhisattva great beings must constantly and relentlessly complete these six perfections.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-043-007-18}}}“Subāhu, how do bodhisattva great beings complete the perfection of generosity? Subāhu, they seek resources in accordance with the Dharma, and not contrary to the Dharma. They practice generosity without bias, and not with bias. They practice generosity without harming or causing distress to creatures or other beings. It is not done for fame, reputation, or praise. It is not done out of cowardice, fear, hoping for reward, or for the sake of a high rebirth. It does not involve hypocrisy, pretense, or disdain. Bodhisattvas respect, venerate, serve, and honor the recipients no matter whether or not they are particularly worthy, have superknowledge,{{note:{index:7,id:UT22084-043-007-19}}} have ethical discipline, are familiar to them, or are their relatives. With great inspiration, intense joy, and strong faith, they give little if they possess{{note:{index:8,id:UT22084-043-007-20}}} but little, they give much if they possess much, they give excellent things if they possess excellent things,{{note:{index:9,id:UT22084-043-007-21}}} they give modest things if they possess but modest things, and they give exquisite things if they possess exquisite things. Subāhu, just as bodhisattvas give one hundred thousand gifts with a magnanimous and cheerful attitude, so do they give a simple coin with a magnanimous and cheerful attitude.

From time to time, or little by little, they also strive and exert themselves in training, developing, and perfecting the acts of giving, offering, and bestowing. Even when they take another birth, they do not lose heart or become discouraged. Subāhu, bodhisattvas’ formation of the resolve to awaken, their recollection and cultivation of the resolve to awaken, and their wishes and aspirations to awaken are themselves their immeasurable, incalculable great acts of giving, offering, and bestowing.

Similarly, they endeavor to abandon, discard, and relinquish the activities of tilling fields and having others till fields; tethering beings and having others tether beings; entrapping beings and having others entrap beings; beating beings and having others beat beings; or slaughtering beings and having others slaughter beings.

It also pertains to those who themselves firmly adhere to the vehicle of awakening, and with steadfast, unshakable, and vajra-like minds, continuously wish and make aspirations for awakening. This is how bodhisattvas understand the three vehicles. {{page:{number:49,id:UT22084-043-007-475,folio:F.178.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.128,id:UT22084-043-007-187}}}“When bodhisattvas hear those teachings and, retaining them, study and consider them, they come to understand the virtuous method: prostrating to the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha. They do so by observing as follows: ‘I prostrate to all the past, future, and present buddhas, dharmas, and saṅghas throughout all the world systems.’ When practicing a single prostration, they form the intention of awakening, imagining that they prostrate boundlessly and immeasurably. When aspiring for awakening, they dedicate it so that all beings may be ferried across, liberated, relieved, attain omniscience, and perfect all the qualities of a buddha. Similarly, when going for refuge they also form the intention of awakening. When practicing any activity—walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, washing, eating, drinking, plowing the fields, or planting seeds—they form and cultivate the mind of awakening through making aspirations for awakening boundlessly and immeasurably.
