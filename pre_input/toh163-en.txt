The Questions of Ratnajālin
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-13}} {{page:{number:1,folio:F.144.a}}} Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-14}} Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in Vaiśālī in a mansion located by the Monkey Pond, together with a great assembly of monks. In the assembly were four hundred twenty million bodhisattvas. Some of the bodhisattvas, such as Maitreya, were held back by just one birth, while others were held back by two, three, four, five, ten, thirty, or forty births, with some bodhisattvas even held back by one thousand births. Also in the assembly were six hundred million worthy ones and nine hundred ninety million gods including the gods in the desire realm and form realm, the four great kings, Śakra who rules the gods, Brahmā who rules the Sahā world, the god Great Splendor, the god Candraprabha, the god Sūryaprabha, the god Pinnacle of Renown, and the god Joyful . In attendance were also the nāga kings Anavatapta, Sāgara, Vāsukin, Manasvin, Nanda, Upananda, Mucilinda, and Mahāmucilinda, as well as the asura sovereign Rāhu and the retinues of all the other asura sovereigns.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-16}} At that time, in the city of Vaiśālī, there was a Licchavi named Limitless Strength, who was the son of Siṃha the captain. Limitless Strength, son of Siṃha, himself had a son, a young Licchavi boy known as Ratnajālin. Since this child had previously served many buddhas, {{page:{number:2,folio:F.144.b}}} he had come to possess the lamp that shines with the immense light of the Dharma way. One time, when he was around eight years old, he had a dream as he slept. In his dream, the god Santuṣita descended from the Heaven of Joy and spoke to him, encouraging Ratnajālin with this melodious song:
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-17}} “The essential being, the Victor, the Buddha, Abides, illuminating the entire trichiliocosm. With vast accumulations of merit, he appears in golden hue. The appearance of this great being is beautiful in all respects.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-18}} “He is endowed with the light of ten million suns And shines like a thousand or even ten million Luminous full moons— As many as there are grains of sand in the Ganges.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-19}} “Shining like many millions of suns, He shines like the supreme disk in the east, Those in the south and the west, And the supreme disk in the north.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-20}} “The light rays that stream forth From each pore of this shining protector of the world Will, each and every one, Make all full moons appear gloomy.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-21}} “From each pore in the skin of those who are omniscient, Light streams forth. The light that shines from him illuminates as many worlds As there are grains of sand in sixty-six Ganges rivers.”
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-22}} In the morning, the Licchavi boy Ratnajālin told his father Limitless Strength, “Father, last night the god Santuṣita arrived from the Heaven of Joy and encouraged me with a melodious song. Father, I am telling you this so that we can begin the practice of worshiping the Thus-Gone One.”
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-23}} At this point the Licchavi boy Ratnajālin sang these verses to his father Limitless Strength:
“The captain of all beings, the perfect Buddha, The great being inconceivably learned in the ways of the world— Please, may you worship this protector, {{page:{number:3,folio:F.145.a}}} For such a guide rarely appears in the world.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-25}} “Just like the uḍumbara flower, He has a beautiful color and delicious scent and fragrance. He is stainless and without afflictions. Such a perfect flower is hard to find.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-26}} “Father, thus I supplicate you: Right now, may you joyfully agree To worship the luminous protector of the world Who perceives the ultimate!”
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-27}} The Licchavi Limitless Strength was delighted and addressed the Licchavi Siṃha:
“O Captain, follow my son’s advice To worship the Victorious One!”
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-29}} To worship the Guide, the Lion of the Śākyas, And to delight the wonderful youth, Six hundred million householders set to work. Śakra with his thousand divine eyes,
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-30}} The powerful gods Brahmā and Īśvara And Susārthavāha, son of Māra, Together with ten million earthly gods, All came to the delight of Vaiśālī.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-31}} Here they produced Billions of thrones made of gold and silver And ornamented with the seven precious substances. Each throne had billions of precious items.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-32}} Each side of the thrones was adorned with jewels And had a fine victory banner of the seven precious substances attached. The size of the thrones was several leagues. The victory banners were half a league high.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-33}} On either side of the victory banners Was a platform higher than a league Made exclusively of a single substance— Precious jewels rising more than a league in height.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-34}} In between the thrones divine banners were hung More than a league long. The banners featured nets of golden tassels Adorned with strings of bells.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-35}} Beneath the thrones were well-fastened columns, More than one billion of them. All of these perfect thrones Were firmly placed, as if bolted to the ground.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-36}} The surface of the thrones was made of gold— Golden and with silver and beryl, Crystal, coral, and emerald too. {{page:{number:4,folio:F.145.b}}} Also, at the bottom and the base
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-37}} Were placed natural pearl parasols, Numbering in the billions And colored red with deep red sandalwood. Having produced the thrones
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-38}} And the heavenly ornaments, {{note:{index:5,id:UT22084-059-006-39}}} clear as water, on the thrones, {{note:{index:6,id:UT22084-059-006-40}}} Golden nets were placed on them And adorned with gold, Silver, beryl, and crystal.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-41}} Having produced the ornaments of coral and emerald, Affixed to those were sweet-sounding bells Resounding with the voice of the Guide. Fumigants were placed there for veneration.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-42}} In the sky above Vaiśālī Was a canopy sewn of golden thread. From each and every golden thread Hung billions of tassels of the finest jewels
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-43}} And billions of ornamental garlands of pearl Strung with golden thread. All the Licchavis who lived in the city of Vaiśālī Were joyful, regardless of where they went.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-44}} They covered the ground of the city of Vaiśālī With pieces of cloth the length of seven men Printed with lattices of red sandalwood And made of well-spun fabrics.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-45}} On the right side, seventy billion instruments Of thousands of different varieties rang forth. On the left side, a further seventy billion Were also engaged in venerating the Lion of the Śākyas.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-46}} Having set forth such a great array, The Licchavi boy named Ratnajālin Joyfully announced to his parents, “I am going before the Buddha.”
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-47}} This learned one left the city And went to where the great victorious lord was staying. The young man bowed his head at the feet of this ocean of virtues And stood to one side.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-48}} Then the Licchavi boy Ratnajālin left the city of Vaiśālī and went to where the Blessed One was staying. He bowed to the feet of the Blessed One and stood to one side. With him standing there to the side, the Blessed One {{page:{number:5,folio:F.146.a}}} delivered a Dharma discourse to the Licchavi boy Ratnajālin that delighted, captivated, and uplifted him, and made him utterly delighted.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-49}} The Licchavi boy Ratnajālin then stood up, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. With his palms together he bowed toward the Blessed One and asked, “Would the Blessed One and his monastic saṅgha agree to take tomorrow’s midday meal at my home?”
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-50}} Out of love for the Licchavi boy Ratnajālin, the Blessed One showed his acceptance of the offer by remaining silent. The Licchavi boy Ratnajālin understood that the Blessed One had accepted through his silence, and so he circumambulated the Blessed One three times before taking his leave.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-51}} The Licchavi boy Ratnajālin then entered the city of Vaiśālī along with Śakra who rules the gods, Brahmā who rules the Sahā world, and the god Great Splendor. With enthusiasm and delight, they began to prepare abundant varieties of food. When the night had passed, they set out cushions and decorated Vaiśālī. They then returned to the Blessed One, bowed to him, and stood to one side. The Licchavi boy Ratnajālin then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, it is time for the midday meal. If it please you, your meal is ready. The time has come.”
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-52}} Accordingly, on that morning the Blessed One donned his lower garments and Dharma robes. Bearing his alms bowl, with his infinite saṅgha of monks he rose into the sky to the height of seven men {{page:{number:6,folio:F.146.b}}} and traveled to the city of Vaiśālī. As soon as he moved, the transformative power of the Thus-Gone One caused all the worlds of the great trichiliocosm to shake six times as they quivered, trembled, and quaked; wobbled, rocked, and swayed; vibrated, shuddered, and reeled; clattered, rattled, and clanged; and tremored, shook, and convulsed. Thus they shook six times with eighteen omens. He also displayed trillions of miracles as he traveled to the city of Vaiśālī. At that time, trillions of gods scattered and tossed blue, pink, red, and white lotuses, flowers made of precious divine substances, the powdered aloewood of the gods, powdered gems, gold from the Jambu river, and powdered divine gems upon the Blessed One. Trillions of divine instruments resounded. Unfathomable divine ornaments adorned him. In the sky above, a steady rain of red sandalwood powder fell to the depth of a chariot axle.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-53}} The Blessed One then arrived at the Licchavi boy Ratnajālin’s home and sat upon the seat that had been prepared for him along with the saṅghas of fully ordained monks and nuns and the assemblies of novice monks and nuns. Seeing that he had arrived, the Licchavi boy Ratnajālin personally served the Blessed One with an abundance of the finest food, drink, and sweets, to please him and serve him everything he wished for. When the Licchavi boy Ratnajālin noticed that the Blessed One had finished eating, he picked up the alms bowl, offered water, and covered the Blessed One’s hands. {{page:{number:7,folio:F.147.a}}} He then dressed the Blessed One with a priceless set of the three Dharma robes. He also dressed the saṅghas of fully ordained monks and nuns and the assemblies of novice monks and nuns with sets of the three Dharma robes. Why? He did this because he was moved by the power of the Blessed One.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-54}} The Licchavi boy Ratnajālin then asked the Blessed One, “If the Blessed One were to grant me the opportunity to request a teaching, I would like to ask the Blessed Thus-Gone One a few questions.”
The Blessed One responded to the Licchavi boy Ratnajālin, “Young man, you may ask the Thus-Gone One anything you are concerned with. Then I shall delight you with teachings that answer your questions.”
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-56}} The Licchavi boy Ratnajālin then asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, in other worlds, are there blessed buddhas that through their previous aspirations have names that, when merely heard, help noble sons and daughters who follow the Bodhisattva Vehicle to end all doubt and hesitation, to become irreversible and fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, to gain recollection of past lives, to never have a stingy attitude, to be surrounded by the bodhisattva assembly and to be without the assembly of hearers, to acquire countless trillions of virtues, to satisfy all beings by pleasing all the buddhas, to terrify the māras, to purify all buddha realms, to cleanse the stains in the minds of all beings, {{page:{number:8,folio:F.147.b}}} to inspire all beings to the virtuous Dharma, to be protected by the gods, to be considered by the bodhisattvas, to be blessed by the thus-gone ones, to never be separated from the blessed buddhas, to perfect bodhisattva conduct by possessing the finest qualities, to gain the entirety of the 84,000 verbal expressions, to attain the voice of Brahmā , and to gain a voice that is in conformity with all worlds?”
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-57}} The Blessed One answered the Licchavi boy Ratnajālin, “Excellent, excellent, young man. Your thought to ask the Thus-Gone One about such subjects reflects excellent eloquence and fine analysis. Thus, listen well, young man, and bear what I say in mind. Then I will teach you.”
“Blessed One, I shall do just that.”
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-59}} The bodhisattva Ratnajālin listened as the Blessed One had instructed, and so the Blessed One said, “Young man, to the east of here there is a world called Pearled. Young man, consider this: There are as many peaks of existence as there are grains of sand in the Ganges. And all those too are filled with the smallest possible particles. If a person then came along and carried away one single such particle and placed it in a spot past as many trillions of buddha realms as there are smallest particles in all those world systems under the peaks of existence—then, young man, by repeating this in the same way for a long time, would that great mass of particles eventually run out {{page:{number:9,folio:F.148.a}}} and reach its limit? Now, young man, tell me, would it be easy to consider, count, assess, or determine the places in the universe where that person placed or did not place those particles?”
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-60}} “Blessed One, it would not be easy. Blessed One, for that reason, anyone who gets the right sense of this analogy that you have expressed would gain a great degree of understanding.”
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-61}} The Blessed One said, “Young man, if all the worlds in which that person placed a particle, or alternatively the worlds in which that person did not place a particle—ranging from the mass of water underlying these worlds up to their peaks—were filled with minute particles, and if a second person came along and removed a single particle from them at a time and placed it in a spot past as many trillions of buddha realms as there were minute particles in those worlds, then, young man, by repeating this for a long time, eventually that great mass of particles would become dispersed. Young man, by this way of proceeding, the latter person would travel past nine million nine hundred thousand incalculable numbers of worlds and thus arrive past countless trillions of buddha realms.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-62}} “That is where the world called Pearled is located. There the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha Majestic King with the Splendorous Voice of Learning Adorned by Precious Moonlight lives, abides, and teaches the Dharma. Young man, those noble sons or daughters who abide in the Bodhisattva Vehicle, who have no doubt regarding the name of the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Majestic King with the Splendorous Voice of Learning Adorned by Precious Moonlight, {{page:{number:10,folio:F.148.b}}} and who trust in my vision, will attain the dominion of a universal monarch after their lives are over. A buddha will appear within their dominions. When they see that thus-gone one, they will perform boundless veneration, practice pure conduct, and master the five types of miraculous abilities. Immediately upon beholding that thus-gone one, they will achieve the hundred-swirled dhāraṇī. They will serve as many buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges. They will turn away from saṃsāra for an equivalent number of eons. Their minds will be undeluded, and they will fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. Their bodies will become solid like that of Nārāyaṇa. Residing in a single place, they will possess the four necessities. {{note:{index:7,id:UT22084-059-006-63}}} Their bodies will take on golden complexions. They will be adorned with the thirty-two major marks of a great being. They will gain the melodious voice of Brahmā . They will eliminate all unfree states and attain an abundance of leisure.”
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-64}} In order to elaborate on the meaning of what he had taught, the Blessed One then spoke in verse:
“Those who hear the name of this world protector And entertain no doubt, Trusting in what I see, Shall become worthy of veneration.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-66}} “They will attain the eternal dominion Of universal monarchs and behold buddhas. Having beheld them, they will perform Boundless and inconceivable veneration.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-67}} “They will always practice pure conduct. They will realize all forms of miraculous abilities. Once they see the Buddha, they will achieve The hundred-swirled dhāraṇī.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-68}} “They will behold as many buddhas As there are sands in the Ganges. They will abandon saṃsāra For that many billions of eons.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-69}} “Those who hear the name of the world protector Spoken to the assemblies and saṅghas {{page:{number:11,folio:F.149.a}}} Will become undeluded, And it will be a cause for awakening to buddhahood.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-70}} “They will always be like Nārāyaṇa. Residing in a single place, they will possess the four necessities. {{note:{index:8,id:UT22084-059-006-71}}} Their bodies will be golden colored And display the thirty-two marks.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-72}} “Those who hear his name And prostrate with their five points Will permanently gain the voice of Brahmā And abandon the unfree states.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-74}} “Those who hear the name of this world protector And entertain no doubt Will not shy away from awakening. They shall never have any hesitation.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-75}} “Those who remember the victor’s name For a full seven days and nights Will purify the infinite seeing eyes Praised by the buddhas.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-76}} “They shall refine the eyes of flesh Into the eyes of a god. They will perceive as many buddhas As there are grains of sand in the Ganges.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-77}} “They will venerate each of them And receive teachings from each as well. Seeing all the buddhas with their own eyes, They will bring comfort to all humanity.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-78}} “Those who hear the name of this thus-gone one Have already offered unfathomable service To the buddhas, All of whom they will recollect.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-79}} “If his name is relayed Before any being at all, When those other beings hear this name, They too will definitely proceed to awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-80}} “By generating faith in this buddha, The unfree states are dispelled, While by engaging in debate and quarreling, One will be born into the unfree states.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-81}} “Once beings have heard The name of this great sage, They shall no longer be interested In debate and quarreling.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-82}} “The actions that lead to the Hell of Ultimate Torment, Which could last for eons, As well as the actions that produce a simple headache— All such actions will not ripen for these beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-83}} “They shall not be burned by fire, Nor drown in water. Even when they draw the ire of the king, It shall be quickly assuaged. {{page:{number:12,folio:F.149.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-84}} “Those who remember this sage’s name Shall be spared many illnesses Including blindness, defective sight, Paralysis, hunchback, and decrepitude.
{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-85}} “Evil and malevolent Yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, Kumbhāṇḍas, rākṣasas, and humans Shall be unable to harm them.

{{milestone:UT22084-059-006-128}} After this, the gods Made a loud cry And scattered pleasing divine flowers, Filling the realm.
