The Animals
The Fifteenth Ground
{{milestone:{label:3.1,id:UT22084-068-021-1904}}}“The monk, the spiritual practitioner who carefully observes inner phenomena, has in this way seen the reality of karmic effects. He has investigated the hells and their neighboring regions, and he has also investigated the second realm, that of the starving spirits. He sees this intolerable cyclic existence correctly, just as it is, and acknowledges it in his mind. Thus, the monk does not dwell in the realm of the māras but abides within the limit of the transcendence of suffering. With unceasing joy, he attains the fruition of entering the fifteenth ground.
{{milestone:{label:3.2,id:UT22084-068-021-1905}}} “As he reaches this ground, the terrestrial yakṣas will inform the celestial yakṣas, who in turn will pass the news to the Four Great Kings. The Four Great Kings will inform the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, who for their part will inform the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife. The latter will bring the message to the Heaven of Joy, and the gods in the Heaven of Joy will inform the gods in the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, who will proceed to tell the gods in the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations. From there, the message will journey beyond the desire realm and into the form realm, where the news will be received by the gods in the Brahmā Realm, and so forth, up to the gods in Luminosity.
{{milestone:{label:3.3,id:UT22084-068-021-1906}}} “Thus, the gods in Luminosity will hear these words: ‘O gods, in Jambudvīpa a noble son, who is of such and such a town, city, and village in such and such a country, and who bears such and such a name, has shaved off his hair and beard, donned the saffron-colored robes, and with faith gone forth from the household to become a homeless mendicant. He has no wish to remain at the level of the māras and does not want any of the objects that belong to their realm. He is conquering the armies of the māras and destroying their servants. He shakes down the mountain of afflictions and causes others to enter the path of the sacred Dharma. {{page:{number:465,id:UT22084-068-021-100491,folio:F.314.a,volume:V68}}} His light shines, and thus he has now entered the fifteenth ground.’
{{milestone:{label:3.4,id:UT22084-068-021-1907}}} “As they receive this message, the gods in Luminosity will rejoice and say to the other gods, ‘O gods, we are supremely happy, because the forces of the māras have been brought down and the side of the sacred Dharma has risen truly high. The retinue of the māras has collapsed! The river of the sacred Dharma flows on! The ocean of the non-Buddhists has dried up! Desire, anger, and delusion are fully pacified!{{note:{index:201,id:UT22084-068-021-1908}}} The forces of non-Dharma have collapsed! The forces of the sacred Dharma have advanced! Cyclic existence has been destroyed! Ah, we listen to this message with supreme joy!’
{{milestone:{label:3.5,id:UT22084-068-021-1909}}} “In this way the sound of the sacred Dharma will pass from one to the other, all the way up to the gods in Luminosity. All will note how this monk has mustered diligence, how his mind is virtuous, unshakeable, and steadfast, and how, free from deceit, he is of an honest nature. Proclamations of his virtues will pave the way to the city of the transcendence of suffering.
The Animals
{{milestone:{label:3.6,id:UT22084-068-021-1911}}}“The monk who has knowledge of the effects of the ripening of karmic action has correctly understood the ripening of the karmic phenomena in hell. He has understood the extent of the lifespans and the remainder of lives within the hundred and thirty-six regions of the hells. He has also concerned himself with the second realm of beings and thus examined, in short, the thirty-six classes of starving spirits. Now, as he examines the nature of the various levels of life, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing and thus perceive thirty-four different kinds of animal life.
{{milestone:{label:3.7,id:UT22084-068-021-1912}}} “He will consider, ‘The five realms of beings have come about in dependence on mental misdeeds. In general, the animals all have distinct appearances, forms, movements, and means of sustenance. Some live in harmony while others do not, some are aggressive and some are not, some are friendly and some are not, some live together and some do not. {{page:{number:466,id:UT22084-068-021-100492,folio:F.314.b,volume:V68}}} Those bearing wings include eagles,{{note:{index:202,id:UT22084-068-021-1913}}} fowl, crows, swans, and so on. Those that may or may not live in harmony include foxes, dogs, and the like. Those that may or may not be aggressive include crows, owls, horses, buffalo, snakes, and mongooses. What are the karmic actions that result in all those different appearances, forms, movements, and feeding habits?’
{{milestone:{label:3.8,id:UT22084-068-021-1914}}} “Here the monk will apply knowledge derived from hearing, and further consider, ‘These beings have different types of minds, different things on which they depend, and engage in different actions. They constitute many different types of beings and partake of distinct forms of food. Now, what are the causes for those animals that may or may not be in harmony?’
{{milestone:{label:3.9,id:UT22084-068-021-1915}}} “As he examines their karmic actions, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing and so see how two proud human beings who are skilled in reciting treatises that promulgate wrong views may recite such unwholesome treatises to each other. What they let each other hear is meaningless, joyless, and offers no means to ascend to the higher realms. Nevertheless, they may cause each other to be zealous about the positions linked with such unwholesome treatises, unwholesome causes, and unwholesome views. When two such people die, they will both be born in hell. In the event that they are born as animals, the causes that can inspire both harmony and disharmony will make them become furious at each other, as in the case of snakes, mongooses, horses, buffalo, crows, owls, and so forth.
{{milestone:{label:3.10,id:UT22084-068-021-1916}}} “The monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects will continue to examine the animal world, wondering what karmic actions and causes may lead to birth as a member of a herd or flock of animals. He will apply knowledge derived from hearing and thus perceive how some female patrons, who are strongly attached to cyclic existence, think, ‘If I am later born as an animal, by this gift may you be my husband {{page:{number:467,id:UT22084-068-021-100493,folio:F.315.a,volume:V68}}} and may I be your wife.’ When later such people separate from their bodies, they will fall into the lower realms and be born among animals that are fond of pleasure. Thus, due to their completed acts, they will be born as pheasants, pigeons, or ducks that enjoy copulating.
{{milestone:{label:3.11,id:UT22084-068-021-1917}}} “Next, the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects will think of foxes and other such disharmonious animals, wondering, ‘What actions will make one take birth as a fox or a dog?’ As he applies knowledge derived from hearing, he will notice how some people steal and constantly covet the delicious food of scholars and people who have taken vows. When people with such inordinate covetousness later separate from their bodies, they will fall into the lower realms and be born as foxes that look for fights and engage in fierce competition among one another.
{{milestone:{label:3.12,id:UT22084-068-021-1918}}} “Next, the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects will examine deer. Applying knowledge derived from hearing, he will notice how some people blow conches or beat drums to drive out other people from towns, cities, or marketplaces and thus incite panic. When later such people separate from their bodies, they will be born in hell. Once they escape the hells, they will become deer that suffer from constant fear. Just as in the past they drove out people from towns, cities, and marketplaces and into the wilderness, they will now themselves live in the jungle or in the forest. If they should be born with the general lot in life of a human, they will, in accordance with their causal actions, suffer from constant fear, and their minds will be extremely feeble and witless. Thus, they will to some extent think like those in the animal world, as if they were animals trapped with snares.{{note:{index:203,id:UT22084-068-021-1919}}} As for those that remain, due to the power of their karmic actions, they will live in mutual discord. {{page:{number:468,id:UT22084-068-021-100494,folio:F.315.b,volume:V68}}}
{{milestone:{label:3.13,id:UT22084-068-021-1920}}} “As the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects continues to examine the animal world, he will ask himself, ‘What karmic actions cause one to take spontaneous birth?’ As he applies knowledge derived from hearing, he will notice how some people out of desire boil worms in water to produce silk. When worms are boiled in this way, millions of tiny insects{{note:{index:204,id:UT22084-068-021-1921}}} are born spontaneously. People then burn these small insects in a fire offering sacrifice. When later such people separate from their bodies, they will fall into the lower realms and be born in hell. Once freed from hell, they will repeatedly take spontaneous birth as animals, such as silkworms.
{{milestone:{label:3.14,id:UT22084-068-021-1922}}} “As the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects continues to examine the animal world, he will ask himself, ‘What karmic actions cause one to take birth from warmth and moisture?’ As he applies knowledge derived from hearing, he will notice how for the sake of wealth some evil people who have wrong views kill fish and turtles,{{note:{index:205,id:UT22084-068-021-1923}}} and bury them in the ground. In a similar vein, other people do the same to otters. Later, as maggots are born from warmth and moisture there, these people will also kill those beings, either sacrificing them or killing them for the sake of profit. When later such people separate from their bodies, they will fall into the lower realms and be born in hell. Once they escape hell, they will be born from warmth and moisture as ants, lice, or the like. Thus, the monk will carefully discern the second mode of birth by means of the path that is true in all respects, comprehending it with exhaustive intelligence.
{{milestone:{label:3.15,id:UT22084-068-021-1924}}} “As the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects {{page:{number:469,id:UT22084-068-021-100495,folio:F.316.a,volume:V68}}} continues to examine the animal world, he will ask himself, ‘What karmic actions cause one to take birth from an egg?’ As he applies knowledge derived from hearing, he will notice how some people who have attained mundane concentration may pacify desire, anger, and delusion. If, however, some condition should make them angry, that mental flaw will make them lose their objective. When separating from their bodies, such people will then fall into the lower realms and be born in the hells. Once free from hell, they will be born from an egg in the animal realm, as a vulture, a crow, or the like. If, when free from such an existence, they are born with the general lot in life of a human, they will constantly be angry and afraid.
{{milestone:{label:3.16,id:UT22084-068-021-1925}}} “As the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects continues to examine the animal world, he will ask himself, ‘What karmic actions cause one to take birth from a womb?’ As he applies knowledge derived from hearing, he will notice how there are some desirous people who let a stallion have its way with a mare, or likewise a bull with a cow, or they set fire to a forest, or associate with a promiscuous, unsuitable person. When such people later separate from their bodies, they will be born in hell. Once free from hell, they will take birth as an animal from a womb. If, when free from such a state, they should be born with the general lot in life of a human, they will, in accordance with their causal actions, be born as the third kind of being.{{note:{index:206,id:UT22084-068-021-1926}}}
{{milestone:{label:3.17,id:UT22084-068-021-1927}}} “As the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects examines the eleven types of animals,{{note:{index:207,id:UT22084-068-021-1928}}} he will proceed to concern himself with the four kinds of food: coarse food, the food of contact, the food of volition, and the food of joy. As he examines the ripening of the effects of these four kinds of food, {{page:{number:470,id:UT22084-068-021-100496,folio:F.316.b,volume:V68}}} he will apply knowledge derived from hearing and so notice how some people of bad character offer food to robbers and thieves, telling them, ‘Eat this and then go kill my enemy.’ If, craving for food, the criminals then proceed to murder the other people, they will, upon separating from their bodies, fall into the lower realms and be born in hell. Once free from hell they will, by force of their actions, be born as animals that live from coarse food. Thus, they will be born as cows, buffalo, donkeys, pigs, dogs, foxes, camels, elephants, horses, sheep, deer, goats, jungle cows, crows, vultures, geese,{{note:{index:208,id:UT22084-068-021-1929}}} herons, gazelle, antelopes, barking deer, spotted deer,{{note:{index:209,id:UT22084-068-021-1930}}} domestic fowl, pheasants, or snakes. They may be born in myriad habitats, living in thorny places, wildernesses, and so forth.
{{milestone:{label:3.18,id:UT22084-068-021-1931}}} “As the monk carefully examines the directions, he will then concern himself with sustenance through contact. Thus, he will think, ‘Some animals are born from an egg. This concerns birds, as well as those animals that live in the water,{{note:{index:210,id:UT22084-068-021-1932}}} on the shore, and in the ocean, as well as nāgas, snakes, animals that live in burrows, or any other such animal. What karmic actions may cause them to eat the food of contact?’
{{milestone:{label:3.19,id:UT22084-068-021-1933}}} “Inquiring in this way, the monk will apply knowledge derived from hearing and thus perceive how some people think, ‘I shall give to others,’ yet they only make gifts mentally, without saying anything. Once they have died, due to karmic actions to be experienced in other lives, they may take birth as animals. In that case their purely mental acts {{page:{number:471,id:UT22084-068-021-100497,folio:F.317.a,volume:V68}}} will make them later consume the food of contact.
{{milestone:{label:3.20,id:UT22084-068-021-1934}}} “As the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects continues to examine the animal world, he will ask himself, ‘How do sentient beings subsist on the food of volition, the third kind of sustenance?’ As he applies knowledge derived from hearing, he will notice how those animals that are born from an egg, such as fish, sea monsters, crocodiles, alligators, oysters, conches, and so forth, live from the food of volition. Thus, if such a mother or father merely thinks of their offspring, they will be satiated by that alone, and they may grow and derive nourishment from that, just as if they were eating with their mouths.
{{milestone:{label:3.21,id:UT22084-068-021-1935}}} “Wondering what karmic actions may cause one to be born in that way, the monk will apply knowledge derived from hearing and so notice how some feeble-minded people, who have no understanding of the consequences of actions, will promise another person that in two weeks, or a month, they will give them a little bit of money, food, or gemstones. The poor person who hears this may then become elated and think, ‘That benefactor is going to give a gift to this poor fellow!’ Yet when the poor person shows up two weeks or a month later filled with joy, the cruel person will go back on his promise.
{{milestone:{label:3.22,id:UT22084-068-021-1936}}} “When later such people separate from their bodies, they will fall into the lower realms and be born in a hell of shifting happiness and pain. Once free from that, they will proceed to take birth among the animals and, by force of having falsely made someone happy, they will gain nourishment from acts of volition. If they should be born among humans, they will, in accordance with their causal actions, become servants of the people they lied to. {{page:{number:472,id:UT22084-068-021-100498,folio:F.317.b,volume:V68}}}
{{milestone:{label:3.23,id:UT22084-068-021-1937}}} “Next, the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects will concern himself with the fourth kind of sustenance, the so-called food of joy, as it is partaken of in the animal world. With knowledge derived from hearing he will notice how certain animals subsist on the afflictive food of joy. Thus, for example, the great ajagara snake that dwells in dark dungeons derives sustenance from the food of joy and wind. The same is the case with creatures such as lizards{{note:{index:211,id:UT22084-068-021-1938}}} and the so-called mountain dweller. The gods in Luminosity also draw nourishment from the food of joy, yet their sustenance is free from ill will. The food of joy sought by animals, on the other hand, is connected with resentful beliefs and sustained by tightly held grudges.
{{milestone:{label:3.24,id:UT22084-068-021-1939}}} “Wondering what karmic actions may cause one to be born in that way, the monk will apply knowledge derived from hearing and thus notice how some people, who are predominantly angry and have a naturally hostile disposition, become motivated by a grudge, which incites them to murder others while under the strong influence of delusion. When later such people separate from their bodies, they will fall into the lower realms and be born in hell. If such beings, who possess both the bases for resentment and pleasure, are born as animals, they will live on the food of joy and wind. If they are born with the general lot in life of a human, they will, in accordance with their causal actions, always get into random and baseless fights with others.
{{milestone:{label:3.25,id:UT22084-068-021-1940}}} “As the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects continues to concern himself with the infinite world of animals, he will ask himself how the animals that live in water take birth. With knowledge derived from hearing he will notice how some people of feeble mind and consciousness may die while tormented by thirst. When that happens, such people fall into the lower realms, where they take birth as water creatures. {{page:{number:473,id:UT22084-068-021-100499,folio:F.318.a,volume:V68}}} Likewise, they may be born into a solitary life in one of the numerous worlds of fish. When people tormented by thirst see water during the intermediate existence, they may pursue it and think, ‘Let me be born there!’ The moment that wish occurs, they will be born in water. Existence manifests due to causes and conditions, and this is how one remains within the corridors of existence. As the karmic actions of those beings—who were not generous and who did not practice virtue—ripen, they will have a constant feeling that the water is hot. Their thirst will continue and the water will feel salty.
{{milestone:{label:3.26,id:UT22084-068-021-1941}}} “Next, the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects will concern himself with birds that scuttle about on dry land and those that fly in the sky. He will wonder, ‘What karmic actions allow birds to fly in empty space and be supported where there is no support?’ As he employs knowledge derived from hearing, he will then notice three forms of miraculous ability: intentional transformation, physical movement, and mental speed. Intentional transformation pertains to those who have miraculous powers. Such individuals are able to travel wherever they wish. If they wish for space to become earth, they will be able to see it as such and walk upon it. Physical movement occurs according to particular features of reality, as in the case of the birds. Mental speed is the provenance of thus-gone buddhas, who are able to arrive in whichever location they set their sights on. In this way, the monk will see that, due to the particular differences in the karmic actions associated with the three realms, there are three forms of miraculous ability. {{page:{number:474,id:UT22084-068-021-100501,folio:F.1.b,volume:V69}}}
{{milestone:{label:3.27,id:UT22084-068-021-1942}}} “As the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects continues to examine the world of animals, he will notice that certain animals, such as birds or deer—whether they move in water, on dry land, or in the sky—may appear in the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, animals, gods, or humans. The monk will then ask himself, ‘Why do such animals experience pain in hell?’ Examining this matter with knowledge derived from hearing, he will see that the hells contain both animals that are counted as sentient beings and animals that are not counted as sentient beings. When beings are born in hell and burn in the fires, there are some birds with physiological distortions that make them perceive that place as enjoyable and therefore form the wish to be born there. Then, as soon as that thought crops up, {{page:{number:475,id:UT22084-068-021-100502,folio:F.2.a,volume:V69}}} they will be born as birds in hell and experience all the sufferings of hell beings that were explained earlier.
{{milestone:{label:3.28,id:UT22084-068-021-1943}}} “When beings take birth in the various regions of hell in accordance with their completed and accumulated acts, they will be frightened by animals that are not counted as sentient beings, such as all the horrifying throngs of lions, tigers, owls, insects, vipers, and constrictors. Those hell beings that are counted as sentient beings may also be hurt by those that are not counted as sentient beings. However, although they may be wounded by such animals that manifest due to their karmic actions, those animals that are not counted as sentient beings do not feel any pain themselves.
{{milestone:{label:3.29,id:UT22084-068-021-1944}}} “Next, the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects will examine the world of starving spirits. He will ask himself, ‘What action may cause an animal to be born in the world of starving spirits, tormented by hunger and thirst?’ Applying knowledge derived from hearing, he will see that animals take birth in all thirty-six classes of starving spirits. Thus, some birds that live in the human realm, such as crows, vultures, or the like,{{note:{index:212,id:UT22084-068-021-1945}}} may kill and eat other birds there. When they later die, the ripening of killing will make them take birth as birds in the realms of starving spirits, {{page:{number:476,id:UT22084-068-021-100503,folio:F.2.b,volume:V69}}} and so they will suffer the physical torments of hunger and thirst. Such birds live from plucking out and eating the eyes of starving spirits, but, as they feed in this way, their negative acts will make their marrow and brains feel extremely hot, as if they were made of acid or molten copper.
{{milestone:{label:3.30,id:UT22084-068-021-1946}}} “As the monk thus examines the birds that live in the realm of starving spirits, he will utter the following verses of instruction:
“ ‘The heat of negative and unvirtuous actions
Ripens here as a heat
That brings great pain.
Therefore, give up evil.
{{milestone:{label:3.31,id:UT22084-068-021-1948}}}“ ‘Stinginess corrupts completely;
Do not engage in flawed actions.
People corrupted by stinginess
Journey to the realms of starving spirits and animals.
{{milestone:{label:3.32,id:UT22084-068-021-1949}}}“ ‘Those who are born in the animal realm
Are aggressive to each other,
And they catch, kill, and eat one another.
Therefore, get rid of dullness.
{{milestone:{label:3.33,id:UT22084-068-021-1950}}}“ ‘A mind harmed by dullness
Will give up spiritual discipline and generosity.
Childish beings fooled by craving
Will be born in the realm of the animals.
{{milestone:{label:3.34,id:UT22084-068-021-1951}}}“ ‘Outsiders do not know right from wrong,
What to eat from what not to eat,
Or how to tell the meaningful from the meaningless.
Such people mix up Dharma and non-Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:3.35,id:UT22084-068-021-1952}}}“ ‘Since their five senses are dumb and obscured,
Such humans will travel to the animal realm.’
{{milestone:{label:3.36,id:UT22084-068-021-1953}}}“Thus, the monk will briefly consider the animal realm, noticing how the chains of karmic action connect many hundreds of thousands of lives, thus causing the river of immeasurable pain and suffering to flow. In this way, due to the interplay of numerous actions that lead to lives as animals, as well as a variety of causes and conditions involving various intentions, there arises an ocean measuring ten leagues. Within this ocean live various fish, sea monsters, whales, crocodiles, and shellfish that torment one another. Those beings have obscured and desirous minds and hence, without any understanding of right and wrong, {{page:{number:477,id:UT22084-068-021-100504,folio:F.3.a,volume:V69}}} they take birth in the deep sea. With a feeling like being burned by acid, and constantly tormented by thirst, they live in fear of mutual killing.
{{milestone:{label:3.37,id:UT22084-068-021-1954}}} “Those that live in the middle ocean{{note:{index:213,id:UT22084-068-021-1955}}} experience anger. Anger may cause beings to take birth as nāgas that lurk in this middle sea. Such nāgas feel hostile toward each other, and, due to this aggression, they shoot poison at each other and are constantly intent on harming one another. Their realm is called Endowed with Enjoyments. Measuring one thousand leagues, it is full of nāga kings. Two kinds of nāga kings live there: those that are righteous and those that are not righteous. The righteous nāga kings bring happiness to the entire human world, whereas the latter cause harm there. Moreover, within the realms of the righteous nāga kings, there is no rain of nāga particles, which are particles that feel like burning sand falling on their heads. However, throughout the realms of the unrighteous nāga kings, such particles do pour down, and thus they burn all the female nāgas there. This happens repeatedly.
{{milestone:{label:3.38,id:UT22084-068-021-1956}}} “The monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects will contemplate the causes of the nāga particles and their related karmic actions, wondering what acts cause the nāga particles to fall. As he examines this with knowledge derived from hearing, he will notice how some people who are overcome and driven by anger, or who are deluded, set fire to the temples of the saṅgha, or to villages, towns, or markets. When such people later separate from their bodies, they will be born in hell. {{page:{number:478,id:UT22084-068-021-100505,folio:F.3.b,volume:V69}}} When they escape from there, they will be born among the nāgas, where, due to their earlier misdeeds of arson, they will be bombarded by the falling nāga particles.
{{milestone:{label:3.39,id:UT22084-068-021-1957}}} “The monk will further examine the world of the nāgas, wondering what actions may cause one to be born where no nāga particles fall. Investigating with knowledge derived from hearing, he will notice how some non-Buddhists with mundane afflictions give thorn-like gifts, and are born within ‘seven thorns’ in the way that was described earlier.{{note:{index:214,id:UT22084-068-021-1958}}} While obscured by anger they may thus pray to be born among the nāgas. When such people later separate from their bodies, they will fall into the lower realms and be born among the nāgas. However, once born as nāgas, rather than having an aggressive nature, they will be righteous and practice the Dharma. Thus, nāga particles will not fall upon their heads.
{{milestone:{label:3.40,id:UT22084-068-021-1959}}} “As the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects continues to examine the world of the nāgas, he will wonder, ‘Karmic actions cause beings to take birth as nāgas in Endowed with Enjoyments, yet how many kinds of righteous nāgas are there, and how many unrighteous nāgas are there?’
{{milestone:{label:3.41,id:UT22084-068-021-1960}}} “Investigating with knowledge derived from hearing, he will notice how the righteous nāgas live in abodes encircled by jewel fences made of the seven precious substances. Their abodes are radiant and feature perfect ponds, cascades, and blue lotuses. The nāgas there live on elixir and are always happy. Their bodies are adorned with flowers, powders, and ointments. While they all have the head of a serpent, they can nevertheless transform themselves into any form they like. Wherever they wish to proceed or relocate to, they will appear there.
{{milestone:{label:3.42,id:UT22084-068-021-1961}}} “The righteous nāga kings are the following: {{page:{number:479,id:UT22084-068-021-100506,folio:F.4.a,volume:V69}}} Seven-Headed, Gajānana, the nāga king Vāsuki, the nāga king Takṣaka, the nāga king Bhadraka, the nāga king Janaka, the nāga king Undefeatable, the nāga king Meghamālin, the nāga king Kuṇḍalin, and the nāga king Shining. All these nāga kings are righteous and follow the Dharma. To ensure fine harvests, they bring timely, sufficient, and delightful rainfall, and they will not cause untimely hail, clouds, or winds. They have faith in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, and follow them with faith. They also protect buddha relics. Since no nāga particles fall on them, their lives are very pleasant.
{{milestone:{label:3.43,id:UT22084-068-021-1962}}} “These nāgas will make rain shower down on the four human abodes: Jambudvīpa, Godānīya in the west, Videha in the east, and Kuru in the north. Whenever mendicants, brahmins, and people in general are righteous and follow the Dharma, the strength of these nāga kings will, as a unique effect of the Dharma, increase. They will then send abundant rain and there will be fine crops with exquisite smell, taste, and color. These nāga kings will not create any harmful disturbances, poisons, or winds. Fine fruits will grow forth and no one will be harmed by the light of the sun or the moon. The righteous nāga kings will not create any nāga trouble, and they will not rouse storms.
{{milestone:{label:3.44,id:UT22084-068-021-1963}}} “Four factors create obstacles to the lives of beings in Jambudvīpa: failed harvests, armed conflicts, being struck by poison and wind, and water problems. When people are righteous and follow the Dharma, {{page:{number:480,id:UT22084-068-021-100507,folio:F.4.b,volume:V69}}} the righteous nāgas will gain strength. They will then abstain from creating any dark clouds—they will not gather any such clouds, and they will not release any troublesome storms. They will not disrupt the rivers but instead they will water the crops and nourish them well. Flowers and fruits will have fine fragrances and tastes. Thus, sentient beings will be happy, free of disease, and strong. These nāgas create positive karmic actions and, as a beneficent effect for sentient beings, they also ensure that the crops are excellent. Thus, these nāgas regard the people of Jambudvīpa with great affection on many levels.
{{milestone:{label:3.45,id:UT22084-068-021-1964}}} “When the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects has examined Jambudvīpa in this way, he will next consider Godānīya in the west. Thus, he will wonder, ‘In what ways do the righteous nāgas that follow the Dharma protect that realm?’
{{milestone:{label:3.46,id:UT22084-068-021-1966}}} “The people of Godānīya in the west have extremely gentle minds. One obstacle that they do experience, however, is unclean water, which may shorten their lives. The righteous nāga kings who follow the Dharma will not create any clouds and thereby let unclean water fall into ravines, gorges, or the mighty mountains. Instead, such nāgas will use their power to purify the water, and so the people of the western realm of Godānīya live happily.
{{milestone:{label:3.47,id:UT22084-068-021-1967}}} “Next, the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects will consider Videha in the east, and so ask himself, ‘Well, how are the righteous nāgas that follow the Dharma able to bring happiness to Videha in the east?’

Thus, whenever the lords of the righteous nāgas that follow the Dharma abstain from causing any thunder or lightning, this protects the humans in Videha from illness.
{{milestone:{label:3.49,id:UT22084-068-021-1969}}} “Next, the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects will think of the harms suffered by the humans in Kuru in the north. Thus, he will ask himself, ‘What harms do the human beings in Kuru encounter?’ As he examines this matter with knowledge derived from hearing, he will see that the people of Kuru in the north are vexed by cold winds. Black clouds and cold winds cause the flowers there to wither and lose their pleasant scent, which makes the inhabitants of that realm despondent. Due to the presence of those black clouds, birds will no longer sing beautifully, and the sounds of lutes and clay drums will no longer be pleasing. In such ways, the activities of the nāgas may cause harm to those who live on mountains such as Mount Illuminator. Yet when righteous nāga kings who follow the Dharma appear there, there will not be any cold winds or black clouds. In these ways the righteous nāga kings that follow the Dharma will bring happiness and benefit to the inhabitants of all four human abodes.

All of these reside in the realm known as Endowed with Enjoyments within the middle ocean.

In Jambudvīpa those nāgas will then create hostility and emit poison from their bodies. They will move within black clouds and cause poisonous trees to grow. They will stir harmful winds that spoil the water, which in turn spoil the crops, so that those who consume them are stricken by severe disease. As the crops are ruined, the lifespan of people will shorten, and wicked and aggressive kings will kill each other. Due to such drawbacks, the number of humans in Jambudvīpa will greatly diminish. These are the ways that evil nāgas create obstacles.
{{milestone:{label:3.53,id:UT22084-068-021-1973}}} “As the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects concerns himself with the nāga kings, he will next ask himself how the unrighteous nāga kings may cause obstacles for humans living in Godānīya in the west. Applying knowledge derived from hearing, he will then see that that realm is ruled by unrighteous human kings. Unrighteous nāga kings that do not follow the Dharma will cause a toxic rain to fall in all the ravines, gorges, and mighty mountain peaks. This rainwater will pollute the water table in general, and so, when consumed by the people of Godānīya in the west, it will cause them obstacles. Thus, the monk will correctly examine Godānīya in the west, and become aware of this.
{{milestone:{label:3.54,id:UT22084-068-021-1974}}} “Next, the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic effects will examine Videha in the east. {{page:{number:483,id:UT22084-068-021-100510,folio:F.6.a,volume:V69}}} Applying knowledge derived from hearing, he will see that when unrighteous people who do not follow the Dharma appear, it will make the hostile nāgas become powerful. They will then produce very loud thunderclaps in Videha in the east. The noise will be as loud as if a mountain were being crushed. When the people in Videha hear this, their hearts will be disturbed, and some will even become sick. The nāgas will also produce flashes of lightning that shoot tongues of flames in the ten directions, while the nāgas dwelling in the clouds take on frightening forms. Their eyes will be as large as chariots, their bodies will be like black mountains, and fire will burn from their three heads. They can also assume the forms of dogs, snakes, and many other horrible forms. Seeing all this will create obstacles for the people of Videha in the east.
{{milestone:{label:3.55,id:UT22084-068-021-1975}}} “Next, the monk who has knowledge of the effects of the ripening of karmic action will examine Kuru in the north, which, although different from the heavens, is like a second heaven. Thus, he will wonder, ‘How do the hostile nāga lords cause harm to the people of Kuru in the north?’ As he applies knowledge derived from hearing, he will notice how, as mentioned before, the people of Kuru in the north enjoy lotuses, blooming flowers, fragrant flowers, and many other exquisite pleasures. Seeing such things satisfies and delights the people of Kuru. However, whenever people who do not respect mendicants or brahmins show up, the hostile nāgas will create thick clouds on the northern continent of Kuru, and those clouds will obscure the sun. As the clouds cover the sun, the lotuses will wither, their smell will become unpleasant, and the flowers will disappear from sight, just like the sun. {{page:{number:484,id:UT22084-068-021-100511,folio:F.6.b,volume:V69}}} When the flowers fade, the minds of the people of Kuru in the north will become gloomy, and the clouds and winds will make the sound of their lutes and clay drums seem unpleasant. Thus, the monk will see how the nāgas can create obstacles in all four realms of human beings.
{{milestone:{label:3.56,id:UT22084-068-021-1976}}} “Next, the monk who has knowledge of the effects of the ripening of karmic action will consider the four continents in terms of their positive and negative attributes. Thus, with knowledge derived from hearing, he will see that while there is tremendous happiness in Kuru in the north, this not so in the other three human realms. In Jambudvīpa the people may be either righteous or unrighteous, and accordingly there will be both prosperity and decline, happiness and suffering. Among these three continents, this one manifests according to people’s karmic actions. Here people may pay heartfelt respect to the ten virtuous actions. Here buddhas appear. Here one depends on the four human abodes. Here people can consider and examine the ten virtuous actions. Here pure conduct is practiced. Here people are mindful of death and birth. Here the Vajra Seat is made of vajra. Even if all of cyclic existence within a distance of eighty-four thousand leagues from Jambudvīpa were destroyed and disappeared, the Vajra Seat would endure and could not be demolished. Since the very cause for them to set their minds on awakening is found here, the blessed buddhas take birth in Jambudvīpa. The number of roots of virtue that cause the attainment of awakening cannot be fathomed, even with the example of Mount Sumeru, so how could anything else within the directions serve as an example? The causes for the emergence of buddhas are here. Although the causes for the birth of buddhas are as rare as a sea turtle poking its head through a yoke floating on the ocean, they are here and not on any other continent. This is where such causes and conditions lie. Among all four human abodes, {{page:{number:485,id:UT22084-068-021-100512,folio:F.7.a,volume:V69}}} Jambudvīpa is the foremost—not any of the others.

Thus, with watering mouths, the women would watch while their masters had their main meal alone, while they themselves would only be given inferior food. Having separated from their bodies those men are then born in the nāga realm, where they subsist on frogs, sand, or air, because karmic effects ripen in ways that accord with their relevant actions.

As he examines the bottom of the sea, he wonders who might live there.
{{milestone:{label:3.62,id:UT22084-068-021-1983}}} “As he investigates this with knowledge derived from hearing, the monk will see that this is the abode of the so-called asuras, who compete with the gods. These asuras are, briefly, of two kinds, because some belong to the class of starving spirits while others belong to the animal realm. Those that belong to starving spirits are, moreover, either starving spirits of the māra class or starving spirits with great magical powers.

Because of the virtues and vices of human beings, Rāhu {{page:{number:487,id:UT22084-068-021-100514,folio:F.8.a,volume:V69}}} will think to himself, ‘The gods are rivals of us, the asuras. Let us go and have a look at those groves, forests, and divine maidens that the gods are so fond of and so attached to!’
{{milestone:{label:3.65,id:UT22084-068-021-1986}}} “With that thought in mind, Rāhu will adorn his body with precious gems such as sapphire and ruby, or with dazzling and pure royal gold, or with natural royal fabrics of blue, red, yellow, or black. Whichever precious stone Rāhu may choose as his adornment, it will make his entire body, which is as large as Mount Sumeru, shine with that same hue. Thus, if he wears a great sapphire, his body will emit an awesome bluish light. Likewise, he may also shine with a red or a yellow radiance, and if he adorns himself with coral, he will shine with the light of that gem. Whichever gem he may choose will lend him its radiance. In this fashion, he is able to compete with the gods and attract the attention of maidens among both the asuras and the gods.

Spanning a hundred thousand leagues, this city is adorned with delightful groves, forests, trees, mansions, ponds, fountains, pools, and spouts that are all made of jewels. The lord of the asuras, who is adorned with flower garlands, powders, and ointments, will then leave this city to inspect the groves and forests of the gods.

The sun has been eclipsed by a yellow planet! The sun has been eclipsed by a black planet!’ Harboring disregard for the consequences of actions and seeking to make a living, such people will proceed to make prognostications that this eclipse means harvests will be either good or bad, that the king will have either success or failure, or that this is either an auspicious or an inauspicious sign. In fact, this is just Rāhu blocking the sun with his hand as he seeks to better see the divine forests, groves, pools, and jeweled beauties.

The forests include the following trees: gośīrṣacandana, black-cloud-color, milkwood-pine, keṭaka,{{note:{index:222,id:UT22084-068-021-2013}}} fragrant-breeze, black agarwood, pine, jewel pine, agnivarṇa, blue aśoka tree, {{page:{number:494,id:UT22084-068-021-100521,folio:F.11.b,volume:V69}}} red aśoka tree, bakula, arjuna, mango-pine, sinduvarati, tilaka, and burflower-tree. On the outskirts of the forests lie lotus ponds and many other trees that bloom with flowers such as maduka, nalikera, and panasa.{{note:{index:223,id:UT22084-068-021-2014}}} There are plantain trees and trees that contain juice.{{note:{index:224,id:UT22084-068-021-2015}}} The trees cover the ground, hide the sky like clouds, and are delightful to behold. They have thick crowns filled with birds and bees. They smell of incense and are full of sweet-scented flowers in all colors. Ripe with flowers, some bloom throughout the year while others bloom according to the seasons. Women delight in their sight, and their flowers are given to women as colorful ornaments.{{note:{index:225,id:UT22084-068-021-2016}}} These beautiful trees are radiant, and some of them grow on embankments, while others are delightful to behold on mountainsides where they are visible from afar. Some of the trees are also found in Jambudvīpa, others in Kuru in the north, while some grow exclusively in the cities of the asuras. Some of the trees that adorn the city of the asuras, which is known as Radiant, only have flowers, while others bear flowers or fruits, or yield nectar.

Frolicking most delightfully, they indulge in afflictive pleasures that soon prove to be impermanent, unreliable, and unpleasant. The asura king has four queens who are called Delightful Beauty, Lovely Scent, Grove of Beauty, and Maṅgalā. One billion two hundred million asura ladies-in-waiting serve the queens. Surrounded by this retinue, {{page:{number:495,id:UT22084-068-021-100522,folio:F.12.a,volume:V69}}} Rāhu remains attached to the pleasures of the senses. It would be no easy task to even name the astonishing pleasures and enjoyments of his realm. He is served by many millions of asuras. His mansion is adorned with one thousand pillars, and the rooms, which are made of silver, are covered with circular designs.{{note:{index:226,id:UT22084-068-021-2018}}} There Rāhu sports, delights, and enjoys himself, experiencing the effects of his own actions.

“ ‘Without any causes
There will be no pleasure, no matter what.

Just as fruits depend on seeds.

So why do those born in that animal realm
Experience pleasures?
There must be a cause for that.’
{{milestone:{label:3.87,id:UT22084-068-021-2024}}}“Examining these matters with knowledge derived from hearing, the bright-minded monk will see that in earlier times Rāhu practiced the brahmins’ Vedas and Vedic auxiliary studies, including studying their traditional legends, and that he was very fond of being generous. To those traveling through deep forests he would offer drink, food, fruits, roots, water, shelter, bedding, and entertainment. When requested by the lowly, beggars, the poor, and the destitute, he would offer them abundant food, drink, bedding, and entertainment. Thus, in those days he possessed an authentic view.
{{milestone:{label:3.88,id:UT22084-068-021-2025}}} “At that time there was temple of the saṅgha {{page:{number:496,id:UT22084-068-021-100523,folio:F.12.b,volume:V69}}} known as Mithila Grove. The temple measured twenty leagues and was surrounded by many hundreds of thousands of beautiful stūpas made of shining gold. The stūpas had been constructed by five hundred kings, including King Nimi. The stūpas had foundations and surrounding ledges that were also made of shining gold, and they were adorned with the seven precious substances, various types of stucco, and edicts from the Buddha Vehicle. They had also been decorated with drawings of forests and groves of the same kind as described before. All the trees that grow in the realm of Rāhu could in those days also be found here in Jambudvīpa, and artists had thus painted them accurately on the stūpas just as they had seen them. The various ponds mentioned before were also painted on the stūpas.
{{milestone:{label:3.89,id:UT22084-068-021-2026}}} “One time, when one thousand chariots were traveling through the deep forest, the brahmin{{note:{index:227,id:UT22084-068-021-2027}}} brought food, soup, and water to the travelers. At that time, however, an evil person set fire to a stūpa that was two leagues tall and five leagues wide, and the stūpa was about to burn down. Seeing that the stūpa had caught fire, the brahmin thought, ‘I have no need for any of its merits, nor is this stūpa an abode of omniscience. Still, because of its beauty, it would be a shame if it burned down. Moreover, if I can save it, the king will surely not reprimand me.’
{{milestone:{label:3.90,id:UT22084-068-021-2028}}} “Thus, without any faith or reverence, he arranged for the chariots to carry water to extinguish the fire. Not thinking much of what he had done, he later said with a laugh, ‘Should there be any meritorious ripening from having done this act, it may be rather coarse. Therefore, by the ripening of this, may I become the being with the largest body within the desire realm.’ Thus, he made this wish without faith or proper attention, {{page:{number:497,id:UT22084-068-021-100524,folio:F.13.a,volume:V69}}} and under the influence of his competitive nature. By the power of that act—as the result of such mindless action as well as the ripening of such true merits—he was born as the lord of the asuras.
{{milestone:{label:3.91,id:UT22084-068-021-2029}}} “Next, the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic action will ask himself what further lands of the asuras might exist beyond the residence of Rāhu. Examining this matter with knowledge derived from hearing or through the divine eye, he will perceive a golden ground that measures thirty million leagues. This land features groves, forests, ponds, pools, birds, trees, houses, cities, islands, and a plateau filled with asurīs and numerous jewels. Adorned with bracelets, these beautiful women are all courtesans of Rāhu alone, and he has no rival. Thus, he sports and circulates among them as he pleases. This land of the lord of the asuras contains thirteen asura realms inhabited by classes of asuras that are known by the following names: eaters, roamers, those fond of causing disease, crystal holders, those who swarm like bees, red-eyed ones, runners, water dwellers, space dwellers, mountain mansion dwellers, ponds of beauty, fish faces, and highway possessors.
{{milestone:{label:3.92,id:UT22084-068-021-2030}}} “These asuras flourish and decline in the following way. When people do not respect mendicants and do not respect brahmins, the forces of the gods weaken, while the forces of the asuras gain strength. At such times, unrighteous beings become extremely powerful and the gods grow weak. When people respect mendicants and respect brahmins, however, the forces of the gods will grow, and the forces of the asuras will weaken. {{page:{number:498,id:UT22084-068-021-100525,folio:F.13.b,volume:V69}}} Thus the success and failure of both gods and asuras depend on Dharma and non-Dharma.

He will then see that they are beings who previously protected the lives of animals, released fish from their nets to keep them alive, or who protected the lives of others motivated by a desire for wealth, fame, or royal favors, or due to observing the religious duties of their family. However, while doing so, these people also engaged in a great number of unwholesome activities. Therefore, when such people separate from their bodies, they will fall into the lower realms and take birth as asuras in the realm of Rāhu. There, they will live with a lifespan of five thousand asura years, of which one day lasts five hundred human years. It is possible, however, that they will die prematurely. Whether they live in good or mediocre circumstances depends on their states of mind. As for their size, colors, and height, these all depend on their actions and destinies, which are determined by the various attitudes and inclinations of sentient beings.

Inquiring with extremely bright, pure knowledge derived from hearing, he will accurately see how a second plateau exists below that of Rāhu. There, extending for twenty-one thousand leagues, is a distinct realm known as Moon Garland. This realm is inhabited by the so-called necklaces, a class of asuras ruled by their lord, Kaṇṭhamāla. Also found in that realm is the city known as Double Pleasure.{{note:{index:228,id:UT22084-068-021-2033}}} Measuring eight thousand leagues, the city is adorned with groves, forests, pools, lotus ponds, waterfalls, mountains, golden mountains, {{page:{number:499,id:UT22084-068-021-100526,folio:F.14.a,volume:V69}}} golden rocks, boulders, rock shelters, wild animals, and feathery birds. The ground is made of beryl and carpeted with beautiful meadows. Various species of birds chirp delightfully, and the asuras who live there have abundant wealth. Thus, they wear exquisite jewelry made of perfect pieces of the seven precious stones and metals.

There are nāga flowers, nāga aśoka trees, axlewood, teak trees, flame-of-the-forest, and so forth. There are also a great number of other trees, such as niśa, prahasa, itiniśa, bagu, and nitanata. These trees are filled with delightful blooming flowers. They are lavish and grow five types of leaves and flowers, which are cherished by humming bees and singing birds alike.

Herds of deer of sundry colors roam therein, while the men and women enjoy constant and abundant pleasures. The beautiful gates are made of precious stones and metals and the forests are continually fanned by cool, fragrant, healing breezes that whisper through the delightful sandal trees. The flowers there are always in bloom and one hears the melodious cries of the many hundreds of thousands of peacocks. The land is guarded by great asuras and the temperature is never unpleasant. {{page:{number:500,id:UT22084-068-021-100527,folio:F.14.b,volume:V69}}} Everywhere are found happy individuals, who enjoy themselves with music, song, dance, and laughter.

Its water is clear, delicious, free of mud and other impurities, constantly present, and radiant like a second moon. This basin in the center of Star Garland is known as Mirror Lake, and its powers are as follows. Before the asuras march to the battlefield, the necklace asuras first proceed to Mirror Lake. Holding their weapons and helmets, they will line up on the shores of the lake and stare into its waters, watching for any omens concerning their military fortune. As if they were gazing into a spotless mirror, they will see their reflections standing clearly in the lake. If they are about to lose the upcoming battle with the gods, the asuras reflected in the lake will appear to be fleeing. And if they are about to die on the battlefield, they will see themselves dead in the lake.

As they look at the surface of the water, they will first see how the human beings of Jambudvīpa who respect their fathers, their mothers, mendicants, and brahmins are born as gods once they die. Next, they will see how the battalions of the gods are victorious, and how the battalions of the asuras are defeated.

{{milestone:{label:3.184,id:UT22084-068-021-2137}}} “Next, the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of the effects of karmic actions will examine the fourth level of the asuras. Through knowledge derived from hearing he will perceive this fourth level of the asuras, which is included in the animal realm, and is known as Immovable. This level extends twenty-one thousand leagues across, and in its center lies the city of Beauty, measuring eight thousand leagues. The abode measures thirteen thousand leagues.{{note:{index:241,id:UT22084-068-021-2138}}} Within the city resides the asura king called Overjoyed. The asuras that inhabit this realm are known as the cheerful; they have great powers, yet their king is far more powerful than they are. He is completely at ease, stable, powerful, and in possession of miraculous powers. He is also completely fearless and not intimidated by anything in the world, including Śakra. With special vigor, he has developed great haughtiness. His realm is located deep below the earth. From there it is impossible to go any deeper, because it rests upon a jewel ground.

Featuring lotus ponds, pools, cascades, gardens, ornamental fences, and mansions made of the seven precious substances, this city is unrivaled. Those who live therein are all on friendly terms, free from any animosity or fear of rivalry. The city is like a second sky, because just as the sky is adorned with planets, stars, and other celestial bodies, this city is decorated and adorned with many different jewels.

Such is also the case with effects.

In retrospect, such a person may think, ‘This donation of food was pointless, and it will bring me nothing good in return. Feeding a commoner like him, who has taken a perverse form of ordination, is as useless as making a donation to a piece of salty soil.’ Thus, although the recipient is filled with good qualities and the gift is of help to others, the donation becomes a spoiled and thorn-like gift. Hence, when such people separate from their bodies, they will fall into the lower realms and be born as an animal that lives in an extremely rich environment adorned with jewels: the realm known as Immovable. As the act of giving to a field endowed with tremendous qualities, without mentally acknowledging that, comes to ripen, one will take birth in a situation like that of Overjoyed, the lord of the cheerful asuras, with all his pleasures. {{page:{number:523,id:UT22084-068-021-100550,folio:F.26.a,volume:V69}}}

Such people will think, ‘I shall not let anyone gather the animals in this forest, nor shall I let anyone herd them. Rather, I shall keep this forest to myself.’ Thus, out of love for the animals and due to a wish to live from collecting honey, such a person will then proceed to collect it. When such people later separate from their bodies, they will be born among the asuras, and the ripening of the act of protecting sentient beings for the sake of their livelihood will cause them to become cheerful asuras.

Thus, the war between gods and asuras depends on nothing but Dharma and non-Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:3.237,id:UT22084-068-021-2196}}} “When the asuras are victorious and defeat the gods, the latter will tell each other, ‘Gods, think of the Dharma. Gods, let the Dharma be what matters most.’ While thus keeping the Dharma in mind and arousing faith in the Dharma, the gods will go to where the asuras dwell. Protected by the Dharma, the splendor of the gods will increase a hundredfold, and when the asuras behold them, blazing with glory, they will become totally discouraged.
{{milestone:{label:3.238,id:UT22084-068-021-2197}}} “At that point, the asura ruler will say to the downcast asuras, ‘Why so sad? These gods are no better than us in terms of splendor, weaponry, arms, or military prowess. So why do you feel so disheartened?’ Thus, the asuras of the realm of Rāhu and the rest will return to fight the gods. Meanwhile, with their bodies nourished by the Dharma, the gods will rush forth to confront the asuras, and thus the two sides will attack each other and wage combat once again.
{{milestone:{label:3.239,id:UT22084-068-021-2198}}} “In the midst of the battle, Rāhu will remain powerful, like a second Mount Sumeru. Still, it is the nature of things that the asuras will be defeated because among all forms of protection, the protection of the Dharma is supreme, and among all forms of splendor the splendor of the Dharma is supreme.
{{milestone:{label:3.240,id:UT22084-068-021-2199}}} “When Rāhu and the other asuras see themselves on the brink of defeat, Rāhu will once more attempt to inspire the dejected asuras, saying, ‘Asuras, why do you flee? Why should asuras find themselves at the level of inferior people? The gods are less heroic than so many asuras, and they cannot compete with our military devices and terrifying weapons. So, come back and take up your positions! {{page:{number:536,id:UT22084-068-021-100563,folio:F.32.b,volume:V69}}} What harm could they possibly do to us?’ Hearing those words, the asuras will once more return to fight in the war. Encouraged, with renewed confidence and infatuated by pride, the asuras will again sally forth to battle the gods, but once again they will end up fleeing.
{{milestone:{label:3.241,id:UT22084-068-021-2200}}} “Rāhu will then show himself as the leader of all the asuras. As their leader, all the asuras obey him, rely on him, are protected by him, and surround him. Therefore, they will again charge toward the gods of the realm of the Four Great Kings, encouraged and reinvigorated by the strength of Rāhu. ‘Our ruler Rāhu strides ahead of everyone. Since he is capable of crushing all the gods and their rulers single-handedly, he can surely destroy the gods of the realm of the Four Great Kings.’ With such thoughts, they examine each other and make sure that their weapons are distributed among them all.{{note:{index:244,id:UT22084-068-021-2201}}}
{{milestone:{label:3.242,id:UT22084-068-021-2202}}} “To bring victory to the asuras and defeat to the gods, Rāhu will now begin to hurl rocks as large as mountains at the assembled gods. When the guardians of the world see how Rāhu is bombarding the gods, they will exclaim, ‘The gods are being damaged by Rāhu, who hurls stones upon them! Now the gods must stop him with a downpour of weapons and arms. Rāhu must be stopped from harming the gods.’
{{milestone:{label:3.243,id:UT22084-068-021-2203}}} “Furious, they will then race toward the asura ruler Rāhu to defeat him. What follows is an utterly hair-raising battle with rocks and weapons cascading down. As the volley of rocks falls into the water, the ocean becomes extremely agitated. The downpour of stones from the gods {{page:{number:537,id:UT22084-068-021-100564,folio:F.33.a,volume:V69}}} ends up decimating many hundreds of thousands of beings that live in the ocean, thus causing great upheaval and mayhem among all the denizens of the sea. As Rāhu and the guardians of the world battle on, the gods and asuras will watch. With amazement they will cry out, ‘Ah, this truly is the mother of all wars!’
{{milestone:{label:3.244,id:UT22084-068-021-2204}}} “If at that time people are righteous and follow the Dharma, the asura ruler Rāhu will be defeated even without any recourse to weapons, armies, or terrorism. If, however, people are unrighteous and do not follow the Dharma, the asura ruler Rāhu will prevail and not the gods. Thus, all of this is primarily determined by the Dharma and is not accidental.
{{milestone:{label:3.245,id:UT22084-068-021-2205}}} “When the army and the powers of the asura ruler Rāhu flounder and face imminent defeat, those asuras still full of trust will say, ‘Why should the asuras flee? If we allow ourselves to lose this battle, we will fall apart. Enough of this despair! Enough! At home we do not find any happiness and our minds will not be happy among the asuras. Therefore, we must not think in this way. We must summon our courage! You need to stop pining for home and get back here! Come back!’
{{milestone:{label:3.246,id:UT22084-068-021-2206}}} “When they hear this encouraging speech, all the asuras will rush back toward the guardians of the world. The two parties will now hurl an unparalleled torrent of rocks at each other, and from the mountaintops they will let loose a barrage of lightning. In this way, they will fight a devastating and utterly hair-raising battle. In the end, however, the gods will be victorious and the asuras will be defeated.
{{milestone:{label:3.247,id:UT22084-068-021-2207}}} “At that time the asuras will think, ‘Alas, the gods are extremely powerful. Thus, in order to regain our strength, {{page:{number:538,id:UT22084-068-021-100565,folio:F.33.b,volume:V69}}} and be successful, happy, and preserve ourselves, let us seek refuge with Firm, the ruler of Star Garland, who lives on the second level. The asura ruler Firm has a firm character. In the war between gods and asuras, he is a hundred, or even a thousand times stronger than the gods, including their ruler.’
{{milestone:{label:3.248,id:UT22084-068-021-2208}}} “Thus, all the leaders of the asuras will go to meet the asura ruler Firm. They will then tell him, ‘O ruler of asuras, the forces of the gods are very strong and no one, including the asura Rāhu, can repulse them. Your Majesty, you must therefore be the guardian and savior of the asuras and ensure that our enemy is crushed. No one—neither the gods and their ruler, nor we ourselves—can withstand the weapon that you wield, and with which you have achieved many a victory in the war between the gods and the asuras. Your Majesty, we request that you decisively repel the enemy. Please brandish your arms and lead your forces and use your powers to conquer the gods. You can defeat even Śakra himself a hundred thousand times. Your strength and prowess will definitely defeat those gods.’
{{milestone:{label:3.249,id:UT22084-068-021-2209}}} “When he hears these words, the asura ruler Firm will go before the asura rulers Puṣpamāla, Vemacitrin, and Overjoyed and say, ‘The forces of the asura rulers, including Rāhu, have been defeated by the gods, and the gods have become very powerful. Because they are so strong, they are hard to resist, and thus the asuras cannot withstand them. Please join the effort so that we can win this war.’ {{page:{number:539,id:UT22084-068-021-100566,folio:F.34.a,volume:V69}}}
{{milestone:{label:3.250,id:UT22084-068-021-2210}}} “To this the asura rulers Puṣpamāla, Vemacitrin, and Overjoyed will reply, ‘Your Majesty, we shall be there to assist you, so please go ahead. Please go ahead. We will be there to help, so that you and Rāhu will be able to defeat all the gods.’
{{milestone:{label:3.251,id:UT22084-068-021-2211}}} “When he has received this message, the asura ruler Firm will set out to meet Rāhu and join the war. When the asuras see the asura ruler Firm, they will become extremely happy and energized. Shooting and striking with various weapons, arms, and arrows, they will storm the gods.
{{milestone:{label:3.252,id:UT22084-068-021-2212}}} “When the gods see them advancing, they will say, ‘Do the asuras just want us to defeat them again and again? Here come those animals that, in spite of their diligence, are already defeated due to the very nature of things!’
{{milestone:{label:3.253,id:UT22084-068-021-2213}}} “With this understanding, the gods will muster all their fortitude. Brandishing their various arms and weapons, they will advance on the asuras with great speed. Seeing them advance, the asura rulers Firm and Rāhu will say, ‘The gods are upon us, the gods are coming to fight us. We shall flank them between our two troops and destroy them.’ Thus, with their hearts set on victory, the asura rulers Firm and Rāhu will jointly advance on the gods of the realm of the Four Great Kings.
{{milestone:{label:3.254,id:UT22084-068-021-2214}}} “Now, while the gods are facing the direction where the sun sets, the asuras will look toward the rising sun. As a result, the rays of the rising sun will hurt the asuras’ eyes {{page:{number:540,id:UT22084-068-021-100567,folio:F.34.b,volume:V69}}} so that they are unable to assail the gods with their downpour of weapons. Thus blinded, the asuras will cry, ‘The sunrays have made us unable to see properly! We cannot fight against the gods!’ At that point, the asura ruler Rāhu will block the sunlight that comes toward him.
{{milestone:{label:3.255,id:UT22084-068-021-2215}}} “This is the third cause of a solar eclipse. Still, scholars who are ignorant about this will in this regard declare, ‘Good rain will fall!’ ‘There will be little rain!’ ‘Things will go well for our king!’ ‘Things will go badly for our king!’ ‘People will face calamity!’ ‘People will be safe!’ Thus, those who are deceived by unwholesome treatises will conceive things in misguided ways.
{{milestone:{label:3.256,id:UT22084-068-021-2216}}} “At this point, by covering the disk of the sun and blocking its sunlight, Rāhu is once again able to see. As he beholds the gods, he will say to the asura ruler Firm, ‘I see the gods well, but I don’t see the asuras clearly. Summon them for the victory charge!’
{{milestone:{label:3.257,id:UT22084-068-021-2217}}} “Then, letting their various weapons pour down like rain, the asuras will hasten forward to attack, headed by Firm. When the gods see them charging, they too will take up arms and run toward the asuras. As Firm advances on the garland-bearer gods, subjecting them to a downpour of weapons, the garland-bearer gods will say, ‘So be it, asura rulers. So be it. The gods have defeated you numerous times, but it seems that you still do not understand about the Dharma. We possess the way of the Dharma, we pursue the Dharma, and we practice the Dharma. We seek victory without giving up the Dharma. {{page:{number:541,id:UT22084-068-021-100568,folio:F.35.a,volume:V69}}} You, on the other hand, are afflicted by covetousness and want to take possession of things that belong to others. When it comes to covetousness, no one has more of it than you. Since you are unrighteous beings, how do you intend to defeat us gods, who practice the ten virtuous courses of action, who are righteous, and who follow the Dharma? Darkness can never overcome brilliant light!’
{{milestone:{label:3.258,id:UT22084-068-021-9898}}} “In response, Firm will say, ‘Oh, why so much talk? We do not want any of your possessions. Rather, the armies of Vemacitrin, Overjoyed, and the others among the four asura rulers have been mobilized to crush all the gods. We have no interest in your wealth.’
{{milestone:{label:3.259,id:UT22084-068-021-2219}}} “At that point the asuras will rush toward the garland-bearer gods.

Non-Dharma can never defeat the Dharma. We never hurt you in any way, so why do you seek to harm us?’ Still, the asuras will continue their attack on the gods.
{{milestone:{label:3.260,id:UT22084-068-021-2221}}} “At this stage, the garland-bearer gods will tell the nāgas, ‘Release a rain of fire onto this army, which is so conceited and useless! Now, the might of that army is going to wane.’
{{milestone:{label:3.261,id:UT22084-068-021-2222}}} “Thus, the nāga king Takṣaka will single out the nāga king Pramatha and release a rain of fire on him. He will also storm toward Firm and let a rain of fire descend upon him as well. Thus, the asuras {{page:{number:542,id:UT22084-068-021-100569,folio:F.35.b,volume:V69}}} and nāgas become engulfed in a great downpour of fire. As the rain of fire falls, the asura ruler Rāhu will pick up a mountain measuring eleven leagues and assail the garland-bearer gods. When the vessel-bearer gods see this, they will bring down a rain of fire to burn the mountain, and so they race toward Rāhu. In this way, they will succeed in burning the mountain to ashes.
{{milestone:{label:3.262,id:UT22084-068-021-2223}}} “When Firm sees that the mountain has been consumed by fire, his strength will weaken, but still he will say to the gods, ‘I shall let other flaming mountains fall upon you all!’ The asuras will then bring a burning mountain before him, and Firm will hurl it at the gods.
 “The gods will respond to the great asuras, saying, ‘Non-Dharma can never defeat Dharma. We always keep the Dharma before us. You remain supported by non-Dharma.’
{{milestone:{label:3.263,id:UT22084-068-021-2225}}} “Seeing this as mockery by the gods, the asura ruler Rāhu will summon all the asuras to storm the gods. When the gods see them coming, they will rush forth to meet them, and thus the gods and asuras will engage in an utterly unbearable battle fought with masses of weapons. At some point, the gods will recite the Dharma, invoke the blessing of the truth, and mentally take refuge in the Three Jewels. Then they shall advance. At that point, the mere sight of the advancing gods will make the entire army of asuras collapse in hundreds and thousands of ways. All the asuras will then flee below the ground.
{{milestone:{label:3.264,id:UT22084-068-021-2226}}} “Pramatha and other such unrighteous nāgas will now call out to the asuras, ‘Asuras, why do you abandon us and flee?

If you are so afraid, then why did you bring your cowardly army up from beneath the earth to fight with the gods in the first place? If you hostile ones now retreat below the earth, where are we supposed to go? Where should we go when Takṣaka, Vāsuki, and the others attack?’
{{milestone:{label:3.265,id:UT22084-068-021-2227}}} “When the asuras hear this, they will once more return to battle the gods. Yet, the gods will be undeterred and diligently charge forth to fight the asuras. When the asuras see that the gods are storming toward them, they will become unable to resist any longer. At that point, the asura rulers Rāhu and Firm will jointly retreat to their subterranean dwellings.

In the war against the gods, you previously achieved numerous victories for the asuras, and must now do so once again. Please pay heed to these matters and arise! Go forth and vanquish the gods and their king!’

Shouldn’t we now defeat the disarrayed gods? My realm can defeat all the gods unassisted, so there is no need to mention what we can achieve when the asura rulers Firm and Rāhu, the son of the lioness, are with us as well. Have no fear!

The gods, however, will recollect the Dharma and take refuge in the Three Jewels. Thus, the stream of their arrows will pulverize the mountains that came from the center of the sea as if they were handfuls of sand. When, as a karmic effect, Puṣpamāla sees the mountains reduced to nothing, he will instead take up a staff and stand before the vessel-bearer gods. But when the gods see him approaching with his retinue, army, and forces, they will cut his staff to pieces with a power that is like a meteoric rain. Thus, they will humble and defeat the asuras.

They will say to one another, ‘The asuras will no doubt return, because Vemacitrin and Overjoyed have not yet come. The life force of the asuras depends on them, the asuras rely on them, and they are their leaders.

At this point, Śakra will think to himself, ‘Ah, since even my own seat is trembling, there will no doubt be a war between the gods and the asuras, because whenever the asura king Vemacitrin sets out against us, these groves and forests, as well as all mountain caves, rivers, mountain slopes, and even Sumeru, the king of mountains, begin to rumble.’

Sixty thousand gold mountains, and Mount Sumeru as well, have been rumbling. All the spirits have lost heart and thus the garland bearers, the ever-infatuated, the vessel bearers, and the triple-lute-bearers have become extremely dejected. They have therefore sent us before you, ruler of the gods, with the request that you offer a proper response from the gods.

I am the protector of the Dharma, the guardian of the Dharma, the support of the Dharma, the victory banner of the Dharma, the patron of the Dharma. I do not like non-Dharma and have no concern for non-Dharma. Since we possess such qualities, they will never defeat us. Have no fear of them. Do not be afraid. With this great army I am on my way to confront the asuras, so fear them not. In Jambudvīpa, people still respect their mothers, their fathers, mendicants, and brahmins. They repay kindness.

With great fury, they will bring down a rain of fire upon them. In the meantime, however, Pramatha has similarly been counseled by Vemacitrin and Overjoyed. Thus, as they see them coming, they will, in turn, bring down flashes of lightning upon the advancing nāgas. Yet feeling the burning pain, the unrighteous nāgas will be forced to retreat to the asura army. With their military might and strength weakened, they will tell the asuras, ‘We have been beaten so far, and winning will be difficult. Still, if we rally together, we might be able to defeat the gods after all.’ With this, they will once more surge toward Takṣaka, Vāsuki, and the other righteous nāga kings.

When the vessel-bearer gods see them coming, they too will surge forward, and, as their armies clash, the gods and asuras will proceed to hurl giant mountaintops at each other and engage in an extremely terrifying and totally excruciating battle in the middle of the ocean. In the course of their fighting, some among the hundreds of thousands of asuras that thus glide upon the sea will either lose their hearing or lose their lives. The battling gods and asuras will release a rain of hundreds of thousands of dreadful weapons upon each other.

Thus, whatever major or minor body part a god may lose, a new one will grow out in its place. Consequently, they do not become incapacitated, nor is their healthy complexion ruined or lost. The only exception is when a god is decapitated, in which case even the enemy of the gods will be pacified.{{note:{index:249,id:UT22084-068-021-2290}}} The asuras, on the other hand, are hurt by weapons in the same way as humans.

When Rāhu sees that, he will himself lift up a mountain measuring three leagues. Noticing that he is rushing toward them, the vessel-bearer gods will take up their weapons and arms and race toward him. As they rain down their weapons upon Rāhu’s mountain, it will be reduced to dust and crumble into the sea. Seeing this, the animal Rāhu, the most inferior among sentient beings, will completely lose heart and, in a rain of the weapons, run back toward the asura army.

Yet, in spite of his size, he shows only meager power, and so the gods are now shaming him as he runs back to the asuras, yearning for safety, refuge, and protection. He is no more than an ordinary asura. He is weak and loathsome. The vessel-bearer gods who are fighting him have more courage than he does.’

When the vessel-bearer gods see them coming, they will call to the garland-bearer gods, ‘Firm is attacking us, the vessel-bearer gods, so the gods should counterattack now! The gods must go on the offensive!’ With this, they race forth toward the asura rulers Rāhu {{page:{number:561,id:UT22084-068-021-100588,folio:F.45.a,volume:V69}}} and Firm.

As Rāhu’s physical strength and his wish to pursue the army combine, he once more returns to battle. The vessel-bearer gods and the ‘necklaces’ that belong to the level of the asura Rāhu will thus meet as enemies, and the two great armies will enter a battle that is horrific on both sides. As mountaintops, rocky summits, arrows, weapons, and trees shower down like rain, the sky above the two armies becomes thoroughly dark, without a trace of light. In this manner, they will struggle to defeat each other in an unrivaled battle.
{{milestone:{label:3.324,id:UT22084-068-021-2295}}} “When a god’s major or minor body part is severed, the limb in question will grow out again just as before. However, when an asura loses a body part, he will be afflicted by the loss and no replacement will grow out. Just as with humans, neither will the head of an asura grow out again once it has been cut off. As for the gods, they only die once they have been decapitated or cut through at the waist. In this way, the gods will not suffer losses as great as those of the asuras. Consequently, although the gods and asuras both sustain losses, the gods do not face total annihilation in the same way as the asuras. When their numbers have been halved at the hands of the gods, the asuras will flee below the ground, yearning for refuge and protection, while the gods triumphantly laugh, ‘The asura rulers Firm and Rāhu have little vigor, their refuge is weak, and their life force is inferior—now they flee all together!’

Is he someone who sits defeated at home—someone who sits at home with his wife, overpowered?’ Thus, with great might and strength, they will once again charge toward the gods, brandishing their various weapons. Like blazing mountain peaks, they shall return to battle with a speed like the wind.
{{milestone:{label:3.327,id:UT22084-068-021-2298}}} “At this point, the wandering gods, the garland-bearer gods, the ever-infatuated gods, and the vessel-bearer gods will all say to each other, ‘How sad—the whole league of asuras has such a fickle mindset. Although these asuras have understood that their army is inferior to ours, they nevertheless come against us.’ At this point, they will run forth to meet the asuras head-on, and, as the two armies clash, the gods and asuras will wage a battle like no other. Sending rains of mountains upon each other, as well as rains of fire, stone, and weapons, the two armies will clash and destroy each other. With numerous weapons, kinds of destruction, horrors, and killings, they will fight a battle beyond compare, {{page:{number:563,id:UT22084-068-021-100590,folio:F.46.a,volume:V69}}} covering the entire surface of the sea. Since this battle is unlike any other, there is no example for it. Thus, the two sides will wage war, and the nāgas will likewise remain engaged in a war that defies example.

Those animals keep getting furious at us for no reason and when they do, they have no fear of combat. Those unholy gods have no fear of war! Still, they have no skill with weapons and arms, so we shall defeat them to ensure that they never come back.

As they lift up hundreds of thousands of golden mountains and fling them at each other, the sky fills with dust, so that soon the sky becomes completely filled with gold dust for up to a thousand leagues. Swarms of arrows from the two sides fall like a constant rain between the dust particles, and the warring parties likewise release a downpour of mountains upon each other.

Overwrought by pain and despair, they will stand crying and wailing on the banks of the lake. In this way, Mirror Lake will become encircled by suffering asura women beating their chests, tearing out their hair, and scratching their bodies, with their faces covered in tears. As the women thus witness the defeat and killing of their husbands, they will cry out in anguish.

However, when Airāvaṇa sees that, he will catch the mountain in his trunk and hurl it back at the asura rulers. Indeed, that elephant is a thoroughbred. When the mountain that Overjoyed threw in that way is thrown back at him, he will be hurt and fall from his seat.

Even if all the asuras were to join your army, I alone could defeat it. Why? Because our army is righteous. The army of the gods is righteous. The army of the asuras is unrighteous. The difference between Dharma and non-Dharma is tremendous. They are as different as darkness and sunshine, truth and lies, Mount Sumeru and a sesame seed, liberation and bondage, the edible and the inedible, ambrosia and poison, night and day, trinkets and jewels, {{page:{number:570,id:UT22084-068-021-100597,folio:F.49.b,volume:V69}}} poverty and wealth, right and wrong, the sun and a firefly, a great storm and a mosquito,{{note:{index:251,id:UT22084-068-021-2327}}} the seen and the unseen, the true path and the false path, buddhas and non-Buddhists, heaven and earth, an eon and an instant. You and I are that different! You take unrighteousness to be the most important thing while I hold righteousness to be the most important. Your intelligence is inferior, whereas the gods are intelligent. You have no vigor, whereas the gods do. You are animals, whereas the gods are gods. Once you comprehend this, you will understand that it makes no sense to run up against me.’

Truth defeats falsity,
Knowledge defeats ignorance,
And gods defeat asuras.’

Some asuras will be distraught by suffering and retreat. Some will lose all courage and retreat. Some will just stand there, staring blankly ahead. Some will linger, though they long to return home. Some will become overcome by anger. Some will be dazed and stupefied. Some will be damaged and depressed. Then, to all who linger, Śakra, riding upon Airāvaṇa, will display his emanations.
{{milestone:{label:3.357,id:UT22084-068-021-2332}}} “As he does so, the rulers of the asuras will behold a lotus flower upon each of Airāvaṇa’s heads.

Moreover, upon each of the thousand heads of Airāvaṇa, the elephant of the lord of the gods, they will behold a thousand lotus pools, and in each pool will lie a thousand lotuses. Each of the lotuses has a thousand petals and a hundred stamens, and upon each lotus and each stamen stand trillions of Śakras, brandishing vajras, weapons, and arms.

Horrified, the asuras will gasp at one another, ‘This multitude of weapons extends throughout all directions without any gaps between them. I fear that these Śakras have also infiltrated the ground beneath us in the same way!’

Fear not, fear not!’ With these words Overjoyed will charge Airāvaṇa, the king of elephants.  When Airāvaṇa sees him coming, the elephant will snatch Overjoyed up with the tip of his trunk and twirl him around as if he were light as air. Having swung him around like that, he will finally let go of him when only a trace of life is left in him. When Overjoyed regains consciousness, he will ask the asuras, ‘Is this the only army that has any courage? All you rulers of asuras, are you incapable of attacking the ruler of the gods?’

But when Śakra sees them coming, he will send down magical, vajra-like hailstorms, not in order to kill anyone but only with the purpose of conquering them. In return, the asuras will bring down rains of mountains and hurl myriad kinds of weapons at the ruler of the gods. The downpour of mountains will be beautiful, like a timely rain. In this way, the gods and asuras will continue waging numerous battles that defy any comparison.

In this way the war will rage on, with all sorts of upheavals and horrors, as the gods and asuras keep on fighting great and unparalleled battles with their destructive weapons and vajras. When Śakra beholds the numerous and diverse asuras, he wages battle not with the intention of taking anyone’s life, {{page:{number:573,id:UT22084-068-021-100600,folio:F.51.a,volume:V69}}} but simply to vanquish them.

Yearning for protection, refuge, and support, they will be bereft of all joy and thus flee below the ground. As Overjoyed beats a hasty retreat along with the other three asura rulers and their hundred thousandfold retinues, all howling and miserable, Śakra will call out to Airāvaṇa, ‘Lord of elephants, Overjoyed and Vemacitrin have lost their spirit even though their chariots are still functional. Now, I cannot kill the asuras because the Great Sage has taught that renouncing killing is the basis for transcending suffering. For all sentient beings, this remains the unerring basis. Therefore, let the asuras escape with their lives, but go and smash their chariots into hundreds and thousands of pieces.’
{{milestone:{label:3.363,id:UT22084-068-021-2338}}} “When he has given this command, Śakra, along with his emanations and the lord of elephants, will then rush toward the gateways to the subterranean world as swiftly as the wind. Seeing this advance, Overjoyed and Vemacitrin will be terrified. Powerless, they will race toward the gateways to the subterranean world. However, Airāvaṇa will grab them as they flee and lift them out of their chariots. With a furious gaze in his eyes, Airāvaṇa will crush the chariots, smashing them into hundreds and thousands of pieces with his trunk as if they were heaps of straw.
