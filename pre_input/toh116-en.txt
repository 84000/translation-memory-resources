{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-55}} At the time of this great gathering, light rays shone in the great Avīci hell. Having shone there, they came to the Jetavana Monastery, where they became adornments for the monastery: pillars adorned with divine, precious jewels; multistoried buildings that were covered with gold; buildings with doors made of gold and silver; buildings with steps made of gold and silver; and upper stories made of gold and silver, the silver upper stories having gold pillars adorned with divine jewels and the gold upper stories having silver pillars adorned with divine jewels.
In the gardens around Jetavana, there appeared various kinds of wish-fulfilling trees. They had trunks of gold and leaves of silver and were bedecked with a variety of adornments, with beautiful monastic robes, {{note:{index:67,id:UT22084-051-004-565}}} with Kaśika cloth, with hundreds of thousands of pearl necklaces, and with hundreds of thousands of crowns, earrings, braided ribbons, armlets, and anklets.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-56}} Outside the monastery there appeared hundreds of trees, which, like the wish-fulfilling trees, were made from precious metals and were bedecked with precious bracelets.
Within the Jetavana Monastery, there appeared stairs made from diamonds and entrance chambers hung with pearls and silks. {{note:{index:68,id:UT22084-051-004-566}}}
Many bathing pools also appeared.

The Jetavana Monastery appeared completely beautified.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-57}} From within that assembly Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin arose from his seat, bared one shoulder, and kneeling on his right knee and facing the Bhagavat, placed his palms together and inquired of the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, I have perceived a great, wonderful marvel. Bhagavat, where did these great light rays come from? Who has this power?”
The Bhagavat replied, “Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva {{note:{index:72,id:UT22084-051-004-570}}} Avalokiteśvara entered the great Avīci hell. When he had completely liberated the beings there, he went to the city of the pretas. It was he who emanated these light rays.” {{note:{index:73,id:UT22084-051-004-571}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-58}} Then Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, as the great Avīci hell is without respite, how did Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara enter it? In the great Avīci hell a wall encloses a ground made of burning iron, which has become one raging flame in the shape of a reed basket. Within this Avīci hell there is a pot from which comes the sound of wailing. Many hundreds of thousands of tens of millions of hundreds of millions of beings have been thrown into that pot. Just as green or black mung beans are massed together in a water-filled vessel, rising and sinking as they are cooked, {{page:{number:10,folio:F.204.b}}} that is how the beings in the great Avīci hell undergo physical suffering. Bhagavat, how did Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara enter the great Avīci hell?”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-59}} The Bhagavat answered him, “Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara entered the great Avīci hell just as a cakravartin king enters a grove made of divine jewels. Noble son, it had no effect upon his body. As he approached the Avīci hell, it cooled. The beings that were Yama’s guards were in a state of agitation and extremely terrified. They wondered, {{note:{index:74,id:UT22084-051-004-572}}} ‘Why has an inauspicious sign appeared in this Avīci hell?’ When the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara entered the Avīci hell, lotus flowers the size of cartwheels appeared, the pot burst open, and the inferno of fire transformed into a pool. On seeing these inauspicious signs appear in Avīci hell, Yama’s guardians became dismayed.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-60}} “Then Yama’s guardians gathered their swords, clubs, {{note:{index:75,id:UT22084-051-004-573}}} short spears, long spears, maces, discuses, tridents, and so on, and, taking all their Avīci utensils, {{note:{index:76,id:UT22084-051-004-574}}} went to the Dharmarāja Yamarāja. When they arrived, they told him, ‘Divine One, know first that our place of work is completely destroyed.’
“Dharmarāja Yamarāja asked them, ‘Why is your place of work completely destroyed?’
“Yama’s guardians answered, ‘Divine One, {{note:{index:77,id:UT22084-051-004-575}}} know first that an inauspicious omen appeared in this Avīci hell, all of which became peaceful {{note:{index:78,id:UT22084-051-004-576}}} and cool. There entered a handsome being, with his hair in a topknot, his body beautified by divine adornments, with an extremely loving mind, and resembling a golden statue. {{note:{index:79,id:UT22084-051-004-577}}} {{page:{number:11,folio:F.205.a}}} That is the kind of being that arrived. The moment he arrived, lotus flowers the size of cartwheels appeared, the pot burst open, and the inferno of fire was transformed into a pool.’
“Yamarāja wondered, ‘What deity has manifested this power? Is this a special result that has occurred through the blessing of the deity Maheśvara, Nārāyaṇa, or some other deity? Have they descended to this level? Or has a powerful rākṣasa been born who rivals great Rāvaṇa?’ {{note:{index:80,id:UT22084-051-004-578}}}
“He looked with his divine sight into the heavens, wondering whose blessing this could be. Then he looked back into the Avīci hell and saw Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara there.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-61}} “Yamarāja went to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, bowed down his head to his feet, and made this special praise:
“ ‘I pay homage to Avalokiteśvara, Maheśvara, lover of lotuses, giver of the supreme boon, who has power; who illuminates the world; {{note:{index:81,id:UT22084-051-004-579}}} who brings relief; who has a hundred thousand arms; who has a hundred thousand times ten million eyes; who has eleven heads; who reaches Vaḍavāmukha; who delights in the Dharma; who completely frees all beings; who brings relief to turtles, crocodiles, and fish; who creates the greatest mass of wisdom; who brings joy; who is a splendor of jewels; who is sublime; who extinguishes Avīci; who is adorned by the splendor of wisdom; who delights in wisdom; who is the one to whom all devas make offerings, pay homage, and show reverence; who brings freedom from fear; who teaches the six perfections; who illuminates like the sun; {{note:{index:82,id:UT22084-051-004-580}}} {{page:{number:12,folio:F.205.b}}} who creates the lamp of Dharma; whose perfectly supreme form is whatever form is pleasing; who has the form of a gandharva; who has a form like a mountain of gold; who is deep like the vast ocean; who has attained the ultimate yoga; who shows his own face; who has many hundreds of thousands of samādhis; who brings true pleasure; who has a beautified body; who manifests as the supreme rishi; {{note:{index:83,id:UT22084-051-004-581}}} who brings freedom from the terrors of bondage in stocks and manacles; who is free from all existences; who has many retinues; who creates abundance; {{note:{index:84,id:UT22084-051-004-582}}} who is a precious wish-fulfilling jewel; who teaches the path to nirvāṇa; who brings the city of the pretas to an end; who is a parasol for beings; who liberates beings from illness; who has a sacred thread made of the nāga kings Nanda and Upananda; {{note:{index:85,id:UT22084-051-004-583}}} who reveals the beneficial lasso; who has hundreds of mantras; who terrifies Vajrapāṇi; who terrifies the three worlds; who frightens yakṣas, rākṣasas, bhūtas, pretas, and piśācas, {{note:{index:86,id:UT22084-051-004-584}}} vetālas, ḍākinīs, kūṣmāṇḍas, and apasmāras; who has eyes like blue lotuses; who has profound wisdom; {{note:{index:87,id:UT22084-051-004-585}}} who is the lord of knowledge; who brings freedom from all afflictions; who accumulates various paths to enlightenment; who has entered sacred liberation; who has paths to enlightenment accumulated within his body; who completely liberates pretas; and who has hundreds of thousands of samādhis as numerous as atoms.’
“In that way, Yamarāja praised Avalokiteśvara with a particularly sacred praise. Then Yamarāja circumambulated him three times and departed.” {{page:{number:13,folio:F.206.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-62}} Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, did Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara leave?”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-63}} The Bhagavat replied, “Noble son, he left the Avīci hell and went to the city of the pretas. Many hundreds of thousands of pretas came running toward him. They were like burned tree trunks; they were like standing skeletons; they were covered with hair; they had stomachs the size of mountains and mouths the size of a needle’s eye.
“As Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara arrived at the city of the pretas, it cooled and the vajra hail ceased. The staff-wielding guard at the gates, who had thick calves and red eyes, became kind and said, ‘I should not be performing this duty.’
“Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s mind was filled with compassion on seeing these beings, and he emitted ten rivers from his ten fingers; he emitted ten rivers from his ten toes; and he emitted great rivers from all his pores. When the pretas tasted the water, their throats widened, their bodies became whole, and they were completely satisfied by the supreme flavor of divine food.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-64}} “Then they contemplated human existence. {{note:{index:88,id:UT22084-051-004-586}}} They thought about saṃsāric existence in this way: ‘Oh! The humans in Jambudvīpa are happy. They can perfectly enjoy cool shade. Happy are those humans in Jambudvīpa who are always supporting their parents and honoring them. {{page:{number:14,folio:F.206.b}}} Happy are those good humans who always rely on a kalyāṇamitra. Those who continuously learn the Mahāyāna are good contemplative beings. Those who follow the eightfold path are good beings. Those who beat the dharmagaṇḍī are good beings. Those who repair dilapidated and ruined monasteries are good beings. Those who repair dilapidated, ruined, ancient stūpas are good beings. Those who are dedicated to the sacred representations and the dharmabhāṇakas are good beings. Those who have seen the activities of a tathāgata are good beings; those who have seen the activities of a pratyekabuddha are good beings; those who have seen the activities of a bodhisattva are good beings.’
“At that time there appeared the sound of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display ; wisdom, like a thunderbolt, destroyed the view of the aggregates as a self, {{note:{index:89,id:UT22084-051-004-587}}} which is like a mountain with twenty peaks; and the pretas were all reborn in the realm of Sukhāvatī as bodhisattvas named Ākāṅkṣitamukha.

Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked him, “Bhagavat, how is that so?” {{page:{number:15,folio:F.207.a}}}
The Bhagavat answered, “Noble son, there appeared in this world the Tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, perfect in wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tamed beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the Bhagavat Vipaśyin.
“At that time, Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, I was a merchant named Sugandhamukha, and I heard Tathāgata Vipaśyin describe the qualities of Avalokiteśvara.”

{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-71}} Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “What were the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara that you heard the tathāgata describe?”
The Bhagavat said, “When all the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, and humans had gathered together, the bhagavat Śikhin looked at the great gathering and began to speak of the Dharma within that assembly. At that time, light rays of various colors emanated from the mouth of Bhagavat Śikhin. They were blue, yellow, red, white, orange, and the color of crystal and of silver. They shone on all worlds in the ten directions, then returned and entered the mouth of the bhagavat.

“Bhagavat Śikhin replied, ‘Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is coming from the realm of Sukhāvatī. I manifest this kind of sign when he is coming. When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara comes, a profusion of wish-granting trees appears, a profusion of mango trees appears, star jasmine flowers and magnolia trees appear, ponds covered with flowers appear, and precious trees appear. There is a rain of various flowers, {{note:{index:92,id:UT22084-051-004-592}}} a rain of precious stones—jewels, pearls, diamonds, beryl, conch, crystal, and coral—and there is a rain of divine cloth.

We were going to Siṃhala Island bringing much merchandise in chariots, in bags, baskets, and pots, carried by camels, oxen, donkeys, and so on, so as to go to villages, towns, suburbs, cities, and markets.
“I found an excellent ship that had been to Siṃhala Island many times. I asked the pilot, ‘Toward what lands are the winds blowing? Are the winds blowing toward Ratnadvīpa, {{note:{index:176,id:UT22084-051-004-676}}} or are the winds blowing toward Yavanadvīpa, {{note:{index:177,id:UT22084-051-004-677}}} or are the winds blowing toward the island of the rākṣasīs?’ {{note:{index:178,id:UT22084-051-004-678}}}

“So we set sail in the great ship in the direction of Siṃhala Island, but the rākṣasīs who lived on Siṃhala Island sent untimely winds that broke the great ship into pieces. We {{note:{index:180,id:UT22084-051-004-680}}} fell into the water and swam to the shore.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-141}} “Five hundred rākṣasīs took on the form of maidens, and with a great cry came down to the shore. They gave us cotton robes. We put them on, wrung our clothes dry, {{page:{number:47,folio:F.223.a}}} and went to sit under a large magnolia tree. Seated, we talked among ourselves, asking each other what we should do, but we agreed that there was nothing we could do, and we became silent.
“The rākṣasīs came to us and said, ‘You who are not masters of a house, become masters. You who have no refuge, obtain a refuge. You who have no home, obtain a home. These will be your homes supplied with food. These will be your homes supplied with drink. These will be your gardens for you to enjoy. These will be your bathing pools for you to enjoy.’

The senior rākṣasī {{note:{index:181,id:UT22084-051-004-681}}} took me home to be the master of her house. She satisfied me with food that had perfect, divine flavors. Having satisfied me with food, she frolicked with me, and in this way I was perfectly satisfied with human pleasures.

“It answered, ‘This is one of the rākṣasīs who live on Siṃhala Island. She is going to kill you.’

“When I returned to the house, the lamp asked me, ‘Head merchant, did you see?’
“I answered, ‘I saw,’ and then asked it, ‘What can I do?’
“The lamp said, ‘Lord, I have a way by which you can comfortably and happily leave Siṃhala Island and see Jambudvīpa once more.’
“It said, ‘There is a divine king of horses named Bālāha who has compassion for the desolate and destitute.

“Once the lamp had told me this, I went to lie down next to the rākṣasī. She awoke and asked me, ‘Noble son, why is your body cold?’
“I answered, ‘I went outside the town to defecate and urinate. {{page:{number:49,folio:F.224.a}}} That’s why my body has become cold.’ And so she went back to sleep.

“Some said, ‘She gives me diadems, earrings, and necklaces.’
“Some said, ‘I don’t have to do any physical work.’
“Some said, ‘She cares for me with sandalwood, musk, and camphor.’
“After the merchants told me these things, I said to them, ‘It is not right for us to be attached to rākṣasīs in this way.’

“I told them, ‘On Siṃhala Island there is Bālāha, the king of horses, who has compassion for the desolate and destitute.

“Bālāha, the king of horses, was enjoying the sarvaśetāna herb. When he had finished enjoying it, he rolled back and forth on the golden sand and shook his body. When he shook his body, the island of Siṃhala shook.

“Bālāha, the king of horses, said to us, ‘None of you must look back at Siṃhala Island. None of you must turn your eyes toward Siṃhala Island.’
“We agreed to do as he said. Then first I alone mounted him, and then the five hundred merchants mounted him. When we were all mounted, the rākṣasīs who lived on Siṃhala Island came running after us, making a great clamor, weeping and wailing pitifully. Hearing the noise, the merchants turned round and looked back at them, and when they did so they fell headlong into the water. When they had fallen into the water, the rākṣasīs pulled them out and ate them.

“Then I sat with my parents and told them everything that had happened. My parents said, ‘Son, we have got you back alive. We do not need wealth. We only need a walking stick for when we are old, someone to guide us on the path when we are blind, someone to make food offerings to us when we have died, and someone to be our protector when we are dead.

You are a repository within the human realm. The devas, nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans gather to listen to the Dharma from you.
“You teach a Dharma that is like a great vajra. {{page:{number:74,folio:F.236.b}}} You liberate many beings who are bound in the bondage of saṃsāra. Meritorious are those beings who live in Vārāṇasī, can see you, and always gather around you. The instant they see you, you burn up all their bad karma.

{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-204}} The dharmabhāṇaka said to him, “Noble son, do not create a cause for remorse. Those who indulge in the afflictions create the realms of beings and have the characteristics of saṃsāra.
“Those who know the six-syllable mahāvidyā will not be polluted by desire, anger, or stupidity. Noble son, just as the gold in the Jambu River does not become stained, someone who wears the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās on his body will have a body that is not polluted by desire, anger, or stupidity.”

It is an unequalled {{note:{index:286,id:UT22084-051-004-786}}} vajra recitation. It is an unbreakable vajra recitation. It is a recitation of the highest wisdom. It is a recitation of unceasing wisdom. It is an unsurpassable recitation. It is a recitation that brings liberation. It is a recitation of the pure wisdom of the tathāgatas. It is a recitation that eliminates desire, anger, stupidity, and the sufferings of saṃsāra. It is a recitation of skill in all methods. It is a recitation of dhyāna, liberation, samādhi, and samāpatti. It is a recitation of entry into all Dharmas. It is a recitation continuously yearned for by the devas.

{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-208}} Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked him, “Bhagavat, how can we obtain the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās, so that we can dedicate ourselves to liberation?”
The dharmabhāṇaka replied, “Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, it is like this: Prajñāpāramitā is known to be the one who gave birth to all the tathāgatas. Even she places her palms together and pays homage to the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās, let alone the tathāgatas, arhats, samyaksaṃbuddhas, and the hosts of bodhisattvas.
“Noble son, this is an essence, like rice.

Why say more about its other virtues?
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-209}} “What does it mean that it is conceived of as a central essence? It can be conceived of as being like the essence of rice.

What is the essence? {{note:{index:292,id:UT22084-051-004-792}}} The essence is the rice. In that way, {{page:{number:77,folio:F.238.a}}} all other yogas are like husks, and from among all yogas, the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās is like the rice.

The dharmabhāṇaka wondered where this voice had come from. Again there came the voice from the sky, saying, “This bodhisattva has undergone many hardships. Give him the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās!”
The dharmabhāṇaka looked up into the sky and saw someone who had a body white as the autumn moon, a crown of coiled hair, an omniscient buddha {{note:{index:296,id:UT22084-051-004-796}}} upon his head, and a beautiful lotus in his hand, and was adorned with the splendor of lotuses.
Then the dharmabhāṇaka said to Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, {{page:{number:78,folio:F.238.b}}} “Noble son, the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has given permission for the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās to be given to you.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-212}} Then Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin reverently placed his palms together to receive it.
Oṁ maṇipadme hūṁ.
As soon as this was given, the earth shook in six ways.
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin attained these samādhis: the samādhi named Unceasing True Nature, the samādhi named Love, Compassion, and Rejoicing, the samādhi named Practicing Yoga, the samādhi named Established in the Entry to Liberation, the samādhi named Illuminating Everywhere, the samādhi named The King of Arrays, and the samādhi named Holding the Dharma.

{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-213}} As soon as Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin had obtained the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās, he offered the four continents, completely filled with the seven jewels, as payment to that upādhyāya.
The dharmabhāṇaka said, “There is no payment required for even one of the syllables, let alone the six syllables of the mahāvidyā, nor will I take anything from you, noble son. You are a bodhisattva, a noble being, with no one higher, and you are my pupil, noble son.”
The dharmabhāṇaka presented him with a string of pearls to the value of a hundred thousand silver coins and said, “Noble son, in accord with my instruction, present this to the Tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha Śākyamuni.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-214}} Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin bowed his head to the feet of the dharmabhāṇaka and departed, having obtained what he sought and with his wishes fulfilled.

Then the Bhagavat, the tathāgata, the arhat, the Samyaksaṃbuddha Śākyamuni asked, “Noble son, did you find what you sought?”
“Bhagavat, it happened, as the Bhagavat knows.”

{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-223}} “In those many-storied palaces, there are golden stairs beautified by delightful jewels of various kinds.
“In those many-storied palaces, there are seated tathāgatas who teach the Dharma to the humans in Jambudvīpa. {{note:{index:314,id:UT22084-051-004-814}}} They teach the six perfections: they teach the perfection of generosity, they teach the perfection of conduct, they teach the perfection of patience, they teach the perfection of diligence, they teach the perfection of meditation, and they teach the perfection of wisdom. {{page:{number:83,folio:F.241.a}}} They teach various kinds of Dharma, continually teaching the humans who live in Jambudvīpa.
“Thus, noble son, they see the pores of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara. They also see deities such as devas, nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, {{note:{index:315,id:UT22084-051-004-815}}} humans, nonhumans, Maheśvara, and Nārāyaṇa assembled in Jetavana Monastery, and many millions of trillions of bodhisattvas assembled there.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-224}} Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, are there no other pores?”
The Bhagavat replied, “Noble son, beyond that pore are the four great oceans that come from the big toe of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s right foot. Their depth is immeasurable. When water comes from the right big toe, it falls on Vaḍavāmukha, transforming it into a heap of ash. Noble son, that is the kind of blessing that Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-225}} But again, Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, is there yet another pore?”
The Bhagavat answered, “There are no more, noble son.”
Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, is Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara coming?”
The Bhagavat said, “Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara {{page:{number:84,folio:F.241.b}}} will come to this great monastery of Jetavana in order to see me, to bow down to me, to honor me, and to give a prophecy concerning the deity Maheśvara in a realm within this universe.” {{note:{index:316,id:UT22084-051-004-816}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-226}} The noble Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara radiated blue, yellow, red, white, crystal, and silver light rays, and those light rays went to Jetavana. When they came there, they circled the Bhagavat three times. Then they left Jetavana Monastery and went to the great Avīci hell. When they arrived there, they cooled the great Avīci hell.
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, from where did those light rays come, and where did they go?”
The Bhagavat answered, “Noble son, Avalokiteśvara radiated those various light rays. They came to this Jetavana Monastery. When they arrived they circled me three times and then went to the great Avīci hell.” {{note:{index:317,id:UT22084-051-004-817}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-227}} At that time, good omens manifested in Jetavana Monastery. Divine magnolia trees appeared and divine lotus pools appeared. {{note:{index:318,id:UT22084-051-004-818}}} At that time, Jetavana Monastery appeared to shine like divine gold. That is what Jetavana Monastery looked like.
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara then left the realm of Sukhāvatī and went to Jetavana Monastery, and eventually arrived there. He went inside Jetavana Monastery, bowed his head to the Bhagavat’s feet, and sat to one side. {{note:{index:319,id:UT22084-051-004-819}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-228}} The Bhagavat, with the voice of the cuckoo, asked, “Noble son, are you tired? Are you weary? Have you completely ripened beings?”
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to the Bhagavat, “I have done as the Bhagavat instructed. I have accomplished the task.”
The Bhagavat gave his approval, saying, “Noble son, it is excellent that you have accomplished the task. Excellent.”
Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara offered lotus flowers to the Bhagavat {{page:{number:85,folio:F.242.a}}} and said, “Bhagavat, the tathāgata Amitābha presents you with these lotus flowers and hopes you are not unwell, not fatigued, that you are in good health, and that life is pleasant.”
The Bhagavat accepted the lotuses and placed them on his left.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-229}} Then the deva Maheśvara came to the Bhagavat, bowed his head to the Bhagavat’s feet, and said, “Bhagavat, I pray that you give me a prophecy.”
The Bhagavat said, “Go, noble son, to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, who will give you the prophecy.”
So the deva Maheśvara went and bowed down to the feet of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and said, “I pay homage to Avalokiteśvara, great lord, who holds a lotus, {{note:{index:320,id:UT22084-051-004-820}}} who has a lotus face, who loves the lotus, who has a beautiful lotus in his hand, who has the splendor of lotuses, who travels around, who brings relief to beings, who completely illuminates the world, and who brings comfort.”
The deva Maheśvara praised Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara in that way and then sat silently.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-230}} Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara asked the deva Maheśvara, “Noble son, why are you silent?”
The deva Maheśvara answered, “I request the prophecy of my unsurpassable true enlightenment.”
Avalokiteśvara said, “Noble son, in the world named Vivṛta, {{page:{number:86,folio:F.242.b}}} you will be the Tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, perfect in wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the Bhagavat Bhasmeśvara.” {{note:{index:321,id:UT22084-051-004-821}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-231}} Then Umādevī came and bowed her head to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s feet and praised him, saying, “I pay homage to Avalokiteśvara, great lord, who gives life, who completely illuminates the world, {{note:{index:322,id:UT22084-051-004-822}}} who has a beautiful lotus in his hand, {{note:{index:323,id:UT22084-051-004-823}}} who has the splendor of beautiful lotuses, who travels around, who brings beings to nirvāṇa, who creates excellent minds, and who holds the Dharma.”
Umādevī praised Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara in that way and then said, “I pray that you free me from this inferior female body of a woman. I pray that you free me from the suffering of the dark impurities in the womb, and from always being owned.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-232}} Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to her, “Sister, your realm will be on the southern {{note:{index:324,id:UT22084-051-004-824}}} slope of Himavat, the king of mountains.” {{note:{index:325,id:UT22084-051-004-825}}} You will be the Tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, perfect in wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the Bhagavat Umeśvara.”
That was the prophecy that Umādevī received.
The Bhagavat said, “Look, Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, {{page:{number:87,folio:F.243.a}}} Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has given them prophecies of the highest complete enlightenment. This, noble son, is entitled ‘the Maheśvara episode.’ ” {{note:{index:326,id:UT22084-051-004-826}}}

Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin then said to the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, I pray that you teach today the special qualities of Avalokiteśvara.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-234}} The Bhagavat said, “Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, it like this: there are the kings of mountains Mount Cakravāla and Mount Mahācakravāla, {{note:{index:328,id:UT22084-051-004-828}}} the kings of mountains Mount Mucilinda and Mount Mahāmucilinda, {{note:{index:329,id:UT22084-051-004-829}}} the kings of mountains Mount Kāla and Mount Mahākāla, the kings of mountains Mount Saṃsṛṣṭa and Mount Mahāsaṃsṛṣṭa, {{note:{index:330,id:UT22084-051-004-830}}} the king of mountains Mount Pralambodara, {{note:{index:331,id:UT22084-051-004-831}}} the king of mountains Mount Anādarśaka, the king of mountains Mount Kṛtsrāgata, the king of mountains Mount Jālinīmukha, the king of mountains Mount Śataśṛṅga, the king of mountains Mount Bhavana, the king of mountains Mount Mahāmaṇiratna, the king of mountains Mount Sudarśana, and the king of mountains Mount Akāladarśana.

“Bhikṣus, the exclusive property of the Saṅgha, such as the embers of the saṅgha’s fire, the smoke of the saṅgha, the vajras of the saṅgha, or the baggage of the saṅgha, should not be used. There are remedies for poison, but there are no remedies for using the property of the saṅgha.” {{note:{index:369,id:UT22084-051-004-869}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-004-256}} Brother Ānanda said to the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, every bhikṣu will remember these words of instruction given by the Bhagavat and will keep the pratimokṣa vows, will follow the Vinaya, and will preserve the Bhagavat’s words of instruction.”
Then Brother Ānanda bowed his head to the Bhagavat’s feet and departed.
Then the mahāśrāvakas departed to their own buddha realms.
The devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans also departed.
The joyful Bhagavat had spoken these words, and the entire community and the world with its devas, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced in what the Bhagavat had said.
