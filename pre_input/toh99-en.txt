{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2344}} Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was staying in Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park at Śrāvastī, along with a great saṅgha of 1,250 monks. At that time, in the city of Transcending Virtue {{note:{index:21,id:UT22084-047-001-2373}}} there was a householder, a master builder, {{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-047-001-30}}} who had engaged venerable Pūrṇa to oversee the construction of a temple with a sandalwood courtyard exclusively dedicated to the Blessed One, exclusively with the Blessed One in mind, and exclusively for the sake of the Blessed One. Subsequently, that temple with its sandalwood courtyard {{page:{number:2,folio:F.2.a}}} had been constructed and completed without delay.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-31}} At that point, the householder master builder said to venerable Pūrṇa, “Pūrṇa, although this temple has been made exclusively for the Blessed One, exclusively with the Blessed One in mind, and exclusively for the sake of the Blessed One, we should also let others use it. In that way this gift of mine will have a greater effect and my efforts will be meaningful. My gift must be put to good use. If I offer this temple and it is used, it will make me very happy.” {{note:{index:23,id:UT22084-047-001-2471}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-32}} Venerable Pūrṇa, the superintendent, replied to the master builder, “Householder, no other ascetic or brahmin would be able to make use of this temple with its sandalwood courtyard, which has been built exclusively for the Blessed One, exclusively with the Blessed One in mind, and exclusively for the sake of the Blessed One. And why? Householder, because the Blessed One’s offering bowl, robes, sitting mat, clothing, park, walkway, seat, and dwelling place are objects venerated by gods and men, including divine beings, demons, Brahmā, ascetics, and brahmins. {{page:{number:3,folio:F.2.b}}} No one else can use them. And why? Because no ascetic or brahmin has such qualities. There is no ascetic or brahmin who has comparable qualities to the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha. His qualities are limitless. Householder, the Blessed One has countless qualities, inconceivable qualities, incomparable qualities, boundless qualities, and inexpressible qualities. Householder, the Blessed One has limitless knowledge, infinite knowledge, inconceivable knowledge, incomparable knowledge, boundless knowledge, and inexpressible knowledge. {{note:{index:24,id:UT22084-047-001-2551}}}

Householder, if the Blessed One so wishes, he can journey to billions of universes, more numerous than the grains of sand in uncountable Ganges rivers, in order to ripen sentient beings. Householder, the Thus-Gone One knows the thoughts and actions of all beings there. He knows them accurately, he sees them, he understands them, they appear directly to him. In the blink of an eye he knows the thoughts and actions of all beings. Householder, if the Thus-Gone One so wishes, he can journey to billions of realms with the mindset of benefiting all beings.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-489}} “Pūrṇa, if I were to invite him to a fine meal in order to acquire roots of virtue, would the Thus-Gone One come here?”
“Householder, even if one is just giving a little, one should still invite the Thus-Gone One to a fresh meal. In order to embrace your roots of virtue, the Blessed One will come here together with his congregation of hearers.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2353}} So the householder master builder, doing what venerable Pūrṇa had advised, fetched flowers, flower garlands, and incense. In the sandalwood courtyard and the roof of the temple he placed flower decorations and sprinkled perfume. He then faced in the direction where the Blessed One was dwelling, draped his shawl over one shoulder, placed his right knee on the ground, and, with palms joined, he said, “Blessed One, please consider me with compassion! Thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha, please come here, together with your congregation of hearers, to accept a fine meal! {{page:{number:222,folio:F.112.a}}} Blessed One, you who reside in the grove of Prince Jeta, with your divine, non-human ear may you hear this invitation made by this householder master builder and agree to come here!”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-491}} In this way, the householder master builder earnestly invited the Blessed One. He then told all his servants, workers, employees, family members, kinsfolk, and companions, “All of you, listen! I have invited the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha, together with his congregation of hearers, to a fine meal. You must now do everything you can to assist in this regard—everything that is in your power!”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2374}} All his friends, kinsmen, relatives, male and female servants, workers, and employees replied to the householder master builder, “Householder, you have gone mad! Householder, you’re confused! Who can invite the Blessed One for a fine meal without being able to see him? Householder master builder, you should invite the Blessed One properly.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-493}} But the householder master builder told his friends, kinsmen, relatives, male and female servants, workers, and employees, “Friends, the Blessed One has obtained the boundless qualities of a buddha. Thus, he knows my thoughts and therefore he will also accept my invitation.”
Hearing this, they all felt delighted, joyful, happy, thrilled, and merry, and that very evening they began preparing plenty of the finest food and drink.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2354}} That afternoon, as the Blessed One arose from his meditative seclusion, he went into the bamboo courtyard. {{page:{number:223,folio:F.112.b}}} At that time the bamboo courtyard was filled with many monks who had assembled there, including venerable Ānanda. The Blessed One then spoke to venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, go to the city of Śrāvastī and summon all the monks in town back to this gathering place here with me.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-495}} Venerable Ānanda obliged and, doing as the Blessed One had instructed, he went to the city of Śrāvastī, summoning all the monks in town back to the gathering place. When they were all back together with the Blessed One, Ānanda said, “Blessed One, all the monks who were in the city of Śrāvastī are now gathered here. Blessed One, they are all here now.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-497}} So the Blessed One then went to the assembly hall, took his seat, and said to the monks, “Monks, in the city of Transcending Virtue there is a householder master builder who has invited the Buddha and the congregation of monks. I have accepted the invitation, so those monks among you who have miraculous abilities, please go now and fetch your ordination sticks.” At that point there was a group of five hundred monks who picked up their ordination sticks. The Buddha then spoke to them: “Monks, in order to delight others with a display of various miraculous abilities, you should journey there through the sky.”
“Blessed One, we will do that,” the monks replied, and they listened to the instructions of the Blessed One.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2475}} In the early morning when the night had passed, the Blessed One put on his lower garment, dressed in his Dharma robes, {{page:{number:224,folio:F.113.a}}} and picked up his alms bowl. He then rose up into the air above the grove of Prince Jeta and flew toward the city of Transcending Virtue. At that time in Rājagṛha there was a monk known as Valkalāyana, who lived in seclusion under a fig tree on the slopes of the Hill of Sages. During the first and last watch of the night he would never sleep but diligently practice, persevering in the practices related to the thirty-seven factors of awakening as well as the practices of tranquility and insight. As he was there practicing, he saw the Blessed One and the congregation of hearers traveling through the sky, as if they were majestic swans. Folding his hands in the direction of the Blessed One, he bowed down and prostrated to him.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2376}} The Blessed One then turned to venerable Valkalāyana and said, “Valkalāyana, come with us!” As soon as venerable Valkalāyana realized what the Blessed One was saying, he jumped right off the cliff into the gorge without any consideration for life and limb. As soon as he leaped into space, he obtained the six superknowledges.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2377}} At that point the Blessed One, Valkalāyana, and all five hundred worthy ones proceeded toward the city of Transcending Virtue.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-498}} Once there, the monks descended on the sandalwood courtyard and the temple in a display of various miraculous emanations. Some took on the form of lions, some the form of tigers; some were elephants, while others were in the shape of horses, bulls, nāgas, garuḍa kings, universal monarchs, and ministers. Some remained in their usual shape as monks. Some monks radiated blue lights, {{page:{number:225,folio:F.113.b}}} while others radiated red, white, and purple lights from their bodies. Some caused a rain to fall, others made the wind blow. Some brought down a rain of gems, while others made it rain with gold, silver, and perfume. Some brought a cool breeze, others carried the ground on their shoulders, while yet others brought clouds with oceans of water. Some arrived in carriages, such as elephant carriages, horse carriages, nāga carriages, kumbhāṇḍa carriages, yakṣa carriages, and gandharva carriages. Still others performed other miracles, such as letting fires blaze and water pour from their bodies. It was amidst all of these miracles and many others that they descended upon the sandalwood courtyard and the temple.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-499}} The Blessed One assumed his own form adorned with the thirty-two marks and the eighty signs of a great being. He was beautiful, shining, with peaceful faculties and a peaceful mind. He was gentle and possessed a sacred tranquility. He was perfectly gentle and utterly tranquil. Brahmā, who is lord of the Sahā world; Śakra, who is lord of the gods; the four great kings; and thousands of gods from the pure abodes venerated him by bringing down a rain of nectar and māndārava flowers as he descended on the sandalwood courtyard and the temple. In this way the Blessed One along with his assembly of hearers caused all beings there to be overjoyed. The brahmins and householders in Transcending Virtue {{page:{number:226,folio:F.114.a}}} all saw the Blessed One and his assembly of hearers descending from the sky and it seemed to them as if they were great majestic swans. Seeing this, tens of thousands of beings purified the eye of Dharma so that it became stainless and free of blemishes. Tens of thousands of beings, who had practiced with previous blessed buddhas, engendered the mind of awakening upon seeing the miraculous manifestation of the Buddha. As soon as they had engendered the mind of awakening, they developed acceptance that phenomena are unborn. The thousands of beings who had not previously engendered the mind of awakening, now did so. Upon seeing the miracles of the hearers, eighty thousand beings, who had previously been tamed by the hearers, now purified the eye of Dharma so that it became stainless and free of blemishes with regard to phenomena. As the tens of thousands of gods witnessed the Blessed One’s miracles, they purified the eye of Dharma so that it became stainless and free of blemishes with regard to phenomena. As tens of thousands of gods in the form realm purified the eye of Dharma so that it became stainless and free of blemishes with regard to phenomena, they obtained the result of a non-returner.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-500}} Then Śakra, the lord of the gods, said to a gandharva prince known as Pañcaśikha, “Pañcaśikha, you must pay respect to the Thus-Gone One.”
“I shall do so,” replied the gandharva prince Pañcaśikha.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2378}} Paying heed to what Śakra, the lord of the gods, had instructed, he and six million other gandharvas paid respect to the Thus-Gone One with song and music. Their tunes and songs caused the nāga kings in the oceans so much joy, pleasure, and happiness that they ventured out from their abodes. As they left their realms, the main elements in the oceans began to churn. The nāga king Sundara and eight hundred million nāgas left the oceans in order to behold the Blessed One. {{page:{number:227,folio:F.114.b}}} The nāga king Surasundara and nine hundred million other nāgas left the oceans in order to behold, venerate, and serve the Blessed One. The nāga king Sāgara and nine hundred million other nāgas left the oceans in order to behold the Blessed One. The nāga king Golden Crown and nine hundred million other nāgas left the oceans in order to behold the Blessed One. The nāga king Utpala Eye and nine hundred million other nāgas left the oceans in order to behold the Blessed One. The nāga king Nanda and nine hundred million other nāgas left the oceans in order to behold the Blessed One. Also to behold the Blessed One came the nāga king Upananda with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Anavatapta with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Elarāvaṇa with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Encompassing Son {{note:{index:30,id:UT22084-047-001-502}}} with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Dark Eyes with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Gautama with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Kambala with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Dhṛtarāṣṭra with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Nīlagrīva with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Golden Throat with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Terrifying with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Manasvin with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Vairocana with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Viraja with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Mahāprabha with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Pratāpana with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Bali with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Mahāmegha with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Mahācandra with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Blower of Wind with nine hundred million nāgas; {{page:{number:228,folio:F.115.a}}} the nāga king Power Wielder with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Sūryagarbha {{note:{index:31,id:UT22084-047-001-503}}} with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Resilient One with nine hundred million nāgas; the nāga king Reflecting All with nine hundred million nāgas; and the nāga king Causing Downpour with nine hundred million nāgas. Apart from them, there was a further boundless number of quintillions of nāgas, each with a retinue of nine hundred million other nāgas, who rose from the oceans in order to behold the Blessed One.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-504}} These nāgas all stirred the oceans, while on land the monks caused a commotion in the cities, towns, marketplaces, and hillside villages. Then the earth began to quiver, tremble, quake, wobble, rock, sway, vibrate, shudder, and reel.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2379}} At that point the householder master builder personally began distributing bountiful and delicious food and drink to the Buddha and the congregation of monks until they were all pleased.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2380}} The Blessed One then warned the monks, “Monks, do not eat these alms! The disturbance by these nāgas has made the city of Transcending Virtue unsuitable.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2381}} Once the Blessed One had accepted his meal, he flew into the sky like a great majestic swan. The Blessed One then discharged the gathering of monks and instead projected a boundless display of hundreds of thousands of emanations. For those nāga kings who wished to see the Blessed One, an emanation of the Blessed One appeared. And in order to ripen those nāga kings who did not have faith in the Blessed One and did not wish to behold him, {{page:{number:229,folio:F.115.b}}} he projected a boundless display of quintillions of light rays, so that an infinite number of quintillions of nāgas gained acceptance that phenomena are unborn, and an equal number gained trust in the Buddha. As soon as they had gained trust in the Buddha, they passed away from their nāga existence and were reborn in the higher realms. As the Buddha had now tamed an infinite number of quintillions of nāgas, he partook of the meal offerings and flew again into the sky.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-505}} At that point in the area of Samapāṇi­tala­jāta there lived an ascetic called Agnidatta, who witnessed the Blessed One flying through the sky. Seeing this, he felt strong devotion to the Blessed One and called out to him, “Blessed One, please grant me that ability! If you come to stay here with me, I will worship you!” The Blessed One knew the thoughts of the ascetic Agnidatta and, out of love for beings of the future, he put down his feet on a flat rock. Then the Blessed One said to the ascetic Agnidatta, “Priest, in order that you develop a trusting mind, this is a support for your worship.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-506}} Then the Blessed One said to Mahā­maudgalyāyana, “Maudgalyāyana, come! We must go to the ocean where Anavatapta resides.”
“Certainly, Blessed One,” Mahā­maudgalyāyana replied, thus obeying the request of the Blessed One. They proceeded to the shores of the ocean where the nāga king Anavatapta resided.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2382}} When the nāga king Anavatapta realized that the Blessed One had arrived together with his community of hearers, he manifested five hundred seats made of the seven precious substances: gold, silver, beryl, crystal, red pearls, coral, and emeralds. {{page:{number:230,folio:F.116.a}}} At the center of these five hundred seats he arranged a seat for the Blessed One made of the seven precious substances and covered it in a fine cloth of the nāgas. The nāga king Anavatapta, together with a retinue of nāga maidens, then went before the Blessed One.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2383}} When the Blessed One knew that Mahā­maudgalyāyana had finished his meal and washed his alms bowl and hands, he said to him, “Maudgalyāyana, please go and tell the elder Śāriputra that the teacher is asking for him.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-507}} “Yes, Blessed One,” replied venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, and he did as the Blessed One had instructed.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2384}} As fast as a strong man can stretch out or bend his arm, venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana left Anavatapta’s ocean and arrived back at the grove of Prince Jeta, right in front of venerable Śāriputra, who was busy stitching his outer robe.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2385}} The two of them first paid various compliments to each other before venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana said, “Venerable Śāriputra, our teacher is calling for you. Since our teacher is fond of you, you must come with me. Our teacher is asking you to go.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-508}} In reply, venerable Śāriputra said, “Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, I should first finish sewing my robe.”
Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana now transformed five of his fingers into needles and began stitching.
“Venerable Maudgalyāyana, why are you doing that?” asked venerable Śāriputra.
“We have to stitch your robe quickly!”
“Very well, then finish the stitching.” {{page:{number:231,folio:F.116.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-509}} So venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana immediately completed the stitching and insisted, “Venerable Śāriputra, come on then, we are leaving now!”
“But I am not leaving.”
“If you do not come, I will carry you with my strength.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-510}} “Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, as soon as you can lift this belt with your strength I will know that you can also carry me.”
In the meantime, venerable Śāriputra had transformed his belt to weigh as much as seven worlds. So when venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana attempted to lift the belt by means of his magical powers , the entire trichiliocosm trembled, yet he was unable to lift the belt.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-511}} At that point many waves appeared on Anavatapta’s ocean, which caused venerable Aśvajit to ask the Blessed One, “Blessed One, what is causing this great earthquake?”
The Blessed One replied to venerable Aśvajit, “It is a manifestation caused by the great hearers.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2386}} Venerable Śāriputra then said to venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, “Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, just go ahead! I will come as well.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2387}} When venerable Śāriputra arrived before the Blessed One, he prostrated to the Blessed One’s feet and took a seat. Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana arrived later, since venerable Śāriputra had attained miraculous abilities related to travel and therefore was the first to arrive before the Blessed One.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-514}} Then, since the Blessed One had caused all this to happen, the nāga kings of the ocean had come to see the Blessed One, and were now also in attendance. At this point the nāga king Sundarānanda said to the Blessed One, “If the Blessed One would grant me the opportunity, I have something to ask of the Thus-Gone One.”
“Sundarānanda, go ahead. For the sake of clarifying your question I will grant an opportunity for all to speak!” {{page:{number:232,folio:F.117.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-516}} Sundarānanda then spoke these verses:
“Let me ask this of the teacher who grants happiness: When acting, how should one act, So that through the path of happiness one reaches nirvāṇa? Blissful one, with your generosity, please teach this!
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-517}} “Here in the nāga realm of Anavatapta we request you, Protector and Blissful One, please teach. As a result of virtuous actions you are beautiful. Through such goodness the Blissful One has come about.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-518}} “As you practiced in your previous existences, You joyfully made all beings happy. As you did such good deeds, You have reached nirvāṇa through the paths of happiness.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-519}} “With the words of the teacher, I, Sundara, became happy, And immediately I knelt on the ground. With boundless joy I am filled with devotion, And prostrate to our guide, Light of the World.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-520}} “I prostrate to the teacher’s intelligent learning. I prostrate to you who leaves all existences behind. I prostrate to you who has the pure and fearless mind. I prostrate to the unique words of the Blissful One.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-521}} The nāga king Surasundara then spoke to the Blessed One in these melodious verses:
“Your fine eyes shine with beauty. Your virtuous mind is freed from disturbing emotions. Your experience is one of stainless wisdom. As you carried out activities, how were your perfect lives?
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-522}} “In order to benefit the world and its gods, Whatever you did, it was in search of awakening and peace. Sacred and supreme being, please teach us About your transcendent mind when you engaged in activity.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-523}} “Victorious One, you have overcome all stains and controlled your faculties. Your mind is free from the ties of desire. We are followers of your realized mind. With your peaceful and undisturbed mind, please teach us.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-524}} “Learned ones act virtuously, And do not regress from that, even at the cost of their life. Whenever you act, you are free of disturbing emotions, And act virtuously with your body and speech.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-525}} “As you carried out good deeds, {{page:{number:233,folio:F.117.b}}} You acted purely toward beings in saṃsāra. Like a lotus blooming in a lake, You are unstained, your awakening accomplished.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-526}} “The speech of the Blissful One, Has made the nāga Surasundara happy and joyful. Right now I bow to the ground, And pay homage to the Buddha, the supreme among men.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-527}} “Sage, you benefit the three worlds. I pay homage to your peaceful intelligence. I will follow the example of your activities, And give rise to the mind that never wavers from awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-528}} “When practicing for the welfare of others, I will disregard life and limb. Bringing an end to suffering, I will become a buddha, And attain unsurpassed awakening and peace.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-529}} Knowing the thoughts of that nāga, The Victorious One smiled, having conquered all enemies. At that point as many buddha realms As there are sand grains in the Ganges were bathed in light.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-530}} As the Blissful One smiled, The gods in the sky called out their approval: “Amazing! The Victorious One has overcome all stains and mastered the faculties. He is unequaled and unexcelled!”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-531}} Many buddha realms shook, And the gods in the desire realm were puzzled. Many assemblies of gods were delighted, And paid homage to the Victorious One, the able ruler.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-532}} The teacher’s hearer who was supreme in miraculous abilities, Maudgalyāyana, asked the Victorious One, “Blessed One, that boundless smile of yours, Blessed Blissful One, what are its causes and circumstances?”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-533}} When Maudgalyāyana asked in this way, The Victorious One replied to clear away doubt: “This nāga who is paying homage to me Will become a buddha in the future.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-534}} “All these realms pervaded by light Will become a single realm of that victorious one. Hence, as he becomes such a victorious one, The name of this guide will be Powerful Victory Banner.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-535}} “Limitless quintillions of beings {{page:{number:234,folio:F.118.a}}} Shall be taken across existence by this guide. That is why I smiled. Maudgalyāyana, you must know this!”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-536}} When the nāga heard this prophecy He became utterly thrilled. Hearing this prophecy, He floated upward to a height of eighty palm trees.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-537}} Floating in space, he surveyed the pure buddha realms in the ten directions, And beheld countless excellent buddhas. Seeing these buddhas, who are supreme among men, He praised the victorious ones in this verse:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-538}} “Victorious ones, you benefit others and have conquered the enemy. You have controlled faculties and your speech is impeccable. I salute you, radiant speakers of the truth! I salute you, blissful ones who speak words without confusion!”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-539}} At that point the nāga king Sāgara addressed the Blessed One in these melodious verses:
“I pay homage to you who relieves fear and has liberated speech! When engaged in activity, whatever you have done Has been free from fear, so that you liberate others. Please teach me that path that relieves fear!
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-540}} “Guide, your being is free from fear, And you liberate others from fear as well. When I hear your well-spoken words, I will become insatiable in acting them out.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-541}} As the nāga Sāgara, the Great Sea, Made this request to the teacher for the good of all, He was timid and respectful, As he sat before the lord of men.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-542}} The Guide, who knew his thoughts, Was fearless in whatever he did. Thus, to free others from fear, He taught in a voice that possesses eight qualities.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-543}} Without any sticks or swords, he taught beings The activities of awakening and what must be done. Again and again he granted them fearlessness From the threats of water, deserts, and warfare.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-544}} As he carried out these good deeds, He was fearless and had reached awakening. With a loving mind in composure, He terrified even the most powerful and horrifying demon. {{page:{number:235,folio:F.118.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-545}} With his knowledge of the ten powers he delighted Sāgara, Who immediately knelt on the ground. Peaceful and free from fear, He saluted the Blissful One with joined palms:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-546}} “I salute the lord of existence! I salute the one who is free from anguish and fear! I also will liberate beings from anguish and fear. I also will become a thus-gone one, a master free from anguish.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-547}} Then the nāga king Golden Crown addressed the Blessed One in these melodious verses:
“Great sage, you have virtuous eyes and your senses are controlled. You have crossed the ocean of existence and reached the other shore. You have reached dry land and become a perfect being who has dried up craving. For the sake of beings, I request you to teach!
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-548}} “No matter what, I will become a blissful one, And abide by the teaching of the victorious one. Not even a thousand demons shall wear me out. Please teach us what must be done!”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-549}} The Buddha sat unmoving, As the leaders of the nāgas made such requests of the Guide. Knowing the thoughts of the leaders of the nāgas, He taught while his mind had abandoned all affliction:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-550}} “With a good motivation one surely comes to possess the Dharma. Certainty must be gained with regard to the empty object. Do not waver from the teaching that is victorious over existence, And aspire to immeasurable awakening!”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-551}} When the nāga Golden Crown, who possessed great miraculous abilities, Heard the Buddha’s words, he had no doubt. He developed an unflinching resolve for awakening, And praised the one who has transcended all fears:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-552}} “You have crossed the ocean of existence and arrived at dry land. You have no doubt and you have obtained an unmoving and stable state. Within existence, you sit firm with your retinue, Like the divine abodes on the king of mountains.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-553}} “I take refuge in this steadfastness, And pledge to become myself like an unmoving mountain. At that point, I will be beyond shaking, But rest like an unmoving mountain.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-554}} The exalted one, who read his mind, Uttered this prophecy in a sweet-sounding tune: {{page:{number:236,folio:F.119.a}}} “In the future, after eighty thousand eons, You will become a buddha.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-555}} “You will become a victorious one through a pleasant path. Your name shall be most beautiful: Valgudarśanā. You will liberate billions of beings, And establish them on the cool, pleasant, and peaceful path.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-556}} When the nāga heard the Buddha’s words, He felt a limitless joy and inspiration, Which cleared him of all disturbing emotions. He then prostrated to the exalted guide of beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-557}} Then the nāga king Utpala Eye addressed the Blessed One in these melodious verses:
“Perfect being, tamer of others, boundless splendor! Your mind is peaceful and you have perfected peace. In your liberation, you possess the peaceful qualities of tranquility. Skilled in peace, your speech is that of a blissful one.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-558}} “Whatever your offspring, the bodhisattvas, do, They delight in tranquility, rely on tranquility, And become skilled in tranquility. Omniscient one, quickly, destroy my doubt!”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-559}} When that nāga had addressed the Victorious One, The Victorious One offered a teaching to King Utpala Eye: “Bodhisattvas train in beautiful tranquility, Which is virtuous karma.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-560}} “Therefore, a skilled bodhisattva Does not get distracted when engaged in activities. By relying on tranquility for millions of eons, One gains sacred awakening and becomes a buddha, the perfect hero.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-561}} “Realizing awakening with a peaceful mind, The guide brings beings to peace. As his mind is peaceful and undisturbed, He causes the afflictions of beings to settle and become peaceful.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-562}} When the nāga Utpala Eye Heard the well-spoken words of the victorious one, All afflictions disappeared and his mind became peaceful, And he engendered the mind set on supreme awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-563}} Basing his mind on tranquility, He engendered the mind of awakening and praised the Victorious One: “Thanks to you, I have realized tranquility! With a mind perfectly at ease, I will become a buddha!” {{page:{number:237,folio:F.119.b}}}

“Blissful One, you have realized tranquility. Victorious One, perfect being, I ask you: Since you abide in perfect awakening, Perfect being, how should one practice special insight?”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-565}} So Nanda asked the leader, who has his being under control. Perceiving the past existences of that nāga, He understood that the nāga had accumulated virtuous karma. Thus, the leader, who has his being under control, replied:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-566}} “In order to search for sacred wisdom, perfect awakening, One must give, unstintingly and without miserliness, One’s wealth and grains, and other bountiful objects, Including one’s spouse and even oneself.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-567}} “Performing such wholesome actions, One must bear great hardships. Then one will master sacred wisdom and become a victorious buddha. That is the result of practicing insight.”

“I ask the guide of all beings, Through what actions should your offspring, the bodhisattvas, Practice the equality of tranquility and insight, And attain the awakening of peace without disturbance?”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-569}} Thus the nāga asked the guide, Who knows the genuine practice of tranquility and insight. Since the guide had become unimpeded in this practice, He delivered this teaching of the blissful ones:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-570}} “When bodhisattvas are engaged in activity, They must rely equally on the strength of both of these practices. In that case, for the sake of others, they will purify equally A quintillion realms.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-571}} “After many millions of eons they will awaken, And take their seat in perfect realms. This result will be praised for millions of eons, Uninterruptedly by millions of buddhas.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-572}} At that point, as the nāga king Upananda Heard this praise of the equality of the vehicles, A boundless joy and happiness arose in him, And he engendered the mind set on perfect awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-573}} For the benefit of the world, the Buddha then gave a prophecy of awakening: “In the future you will be a buddha, {{page:{number:238,folio:F.120.a}}} And your name shall be Victorious Guide with All-Seeing Eyes. You will liberate billions of beings.”

{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-577}} “If one can act in such a fine way, One will be gentle and compassionate to any being Who longs for pleasure in saṃsāra. By giving wealth to others, that summarizes the practice.

“Golden Victor, what deeds did you perform That led you to steadfastly penetrate knowledge of the three times? I ask you this, you who have space-like wisdom— Guide of beings, please explain this to me.”

{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-798}} “If you constantly apply mindfulness, You will not fall under the sway of affliction and Māra. If you constantly practice mindfulness with purity of mind, Then you will not be led into the influence of Māra.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-799}} Hearing the Victor’s excellent speech, The nāga was delighted by the Teacher’s words. He praised the Blissful One with a clear mind And pure and irreproachable language:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-800}} “You have conquered birth in existence and are full of love. Perceiving how beings are following bad paths, You eliminate doubt and with a joyful mind Lead beings onto the path prescribed by the victors.

{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-802}} Then the nāga king Causing Downpour asked the Blessed One in the form of a song in verse:
“Supreme and loving refuge of beings, All-seeing , compassionate, eminent Victor, How should one practice toward flawless awakening? With your assemblage of ten powers and wisdom, I beseech you:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-803}} “O Protector of the World, please extinguish my doubts!” Aware of the thoughts of all beings, The Blissful One delighted the nāga, saying, “To understand your mind, train in steady diligence,
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-804}} Just as the Blissful One has taught. To understand your mind, gain conviction.” Hearing of the path taught by the Victor, he remained there, His mind elated, having removed all doubt.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-805}} With joy he knelt on the ground And praised the Guide who benefits the world:
“Having eliminated all affliction, you are unsurpassed. {{page:{number:261,folio:F.131.b}}} There is no one like you, let alone superior. You delight the minds of beings irreproachably— Blissful One, homage to your tremendous awakening!”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-807}} The Blessed One was aware of the thoughts of all these nāga kings. He understood their karma and he understood their aspirations.

They display signs of kindness, signs of adherence, signs of being guides, signs of leadership, and signs of reaching the end.

Knowledge of What Is Possible
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-809}} {{note:{index:38,id:UT22084-047-001-2485}}} Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana then addressed the Blessed One. “From the Thus-Gone One’s correct knowledge of the ripening of beings’ karma, up to the Blessed One’s great miraculous powers and right up to the Blessed One’s great majesty—all of these qualities are truly amazing. Blessed One, what action was it whose ripening led the Blessed One to attain the knowledge of what is possible? Blessed One, please consider all beings kindly and grant a reply. When the bodhisattva great beings hear what the Blessed One declares, they will take joy, pleasure, and delight in carrying out the practices of unexcelled and perfect awakening. Then they will engage in such practices.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-810}} The Blessed One said to venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, “Excellent, Maudgalyāyana, excellent. {{page:{number:262,folio:F.132.a}}} Maudgalyāyana, your intention in asking this question to the Blessed One is to help many beings, to bring about many beings’ welfare, and because you care for beings. You asked in order to help, benefit, and bring about the well-being of multitudes of beings. It is excellent that you had the thought to ask this question to the Thus-Gone One.

{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-811}} “Of course,” venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana replied to the Blessed One. He listened attentively to the Blessed One, who proceeded: “Maudgalyāyana, when in the past I was engaged in the practice of a bodhisattva, in order to know what is possible, I served and asked questions to countless thus-gone ones. You should understand, Maudgalyāyana, the amount of roots of virtue I created in doing so, through the following story.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-812}} “Long ago, Maudgalyāyana, in the distant past there appeared in the world a thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha named Flower Bearer; he was learned and venerable, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman who guided beings, unexcelled, a teacher of gods and humans, a blessed buddha. This thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha called Flower Bearer had a community of nine hundred sixty million hearers. At that time there was a brahmin named Blue Lotus Eyes, who was similar to a great sal tree. He offered a monastery to the blessed thus-gone Flower Bearer and his community of hearers. While doing so, he made an aspiration: ‘By the root of virtue from having provided a dwelling for the Blessed One and his community of hearers, O Blessed One, may I gain knowledge of what is possible.’
“The thus-gone Flower Bearer then showed his approval to me, saying, ‘Excellent. Excellent, Blue Lotus Eyes. By this root of virtue, Blue Lotus Eyes, {{page:{number:263,folio:F.132.b}}} in the future you will gain knowledge of what is possible.’ And so it was through that root of virtue that I achieved knowledge of what is possible.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-814}} The Blessed One then spoke this verse:
“By the root of virtue Of offering a monastery And a home for meditators, I gained knowledge of what is possible.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-815}} “When I had created this root of virtue, I then formed the resolve: ‘I rejoice in the merit of all beings in the worlds throughout the ten directions who have brought about the roots of virtue for the knowledge of what is possible; I dedicate the merit from this act of rejoicing as well toward unexcelled and perfect awakening.’ It was due to that root of virtue that I came to gain knowledge of the origin as related to knowledge of what is possible.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-816}} The Blessed One then proceeded to utter these verses:
“In order to know what is possible, I rejoiced in the actions of anyone Who practiced without indolence. With my attention unwavering
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-817}} “I rejoiced in virtue, And bearing in mind the deeds Of such lords among men, rejoiced. This is how I achieved knowledge of the origin.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-818}} “I constantly and continuously rejoiced in what roots of virtue had been formed, without any attachment to the three realms in my mind. By the root of virtue of having no doubt about their ripening, I realized the knowledge of cessation as related to knowledge of what is possible. I did not reach such realization by being lazy; I was diligent on this path. Through such roots of virtue I realized the knowledge of the path that leads to cessation as related to knowledge of what is possible.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-819}} The Blessed One then proceeded to utter these verses:
“Knowledge of what is possible, As well as of origin , cessation, And the path to achieve these— The supreme among humans understands them.

Knowledge of What Is Impossible
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-821}} “Maudgalyāyana, I also created an unfathomable amount of roots of virtue for the purpose of knowledge of what is impossible. {{page:{number:264,folio:F.133.a}}} Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, in the distant past there appeared in the world a thus-gone named Non-Abiding Action. The thus-gone Non-Abiding Action had a gathering of sixty-eight thousand hearers. At that time there was a householder named Listening Practice, who supplied the thus-gone Non-Abiding Action with all his belongings and then made the prayer: ‘By this root of virtue, may I achieve the non-abiding Dharma.’ At the same time, he did not form any aspirations to gain any wealth thereby. Because of forming such roots of virtue, I have now fully overcome the basis for further existence, transmigration, death, or rebirth. It is due to this root of virtue that I realized knowledge of what is impossible.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-822}} The Blessed One then proceeded to utter this verse:
“He who rallied beings, While applying the powers of discipline and patience With a mind that did not rely on anything, Achieved knowledge of what is impossible.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-823}} “I brought countless sentient beings to knowledge of what is impossible, thereby creating roots of virtue; I then rejoiced in those roots of virtue. Due to those roots of virtue I accomplished knowledge of the origin as related to knowledge of what is impossible. Moreover, I dedicated those roots of virtue exclusively toward unexcelled and perfect awakening, and never toward manifesting aggregates. It was through those roots of virtue that I accomplished knowledge of cessation as related to knowledge of what is impossible.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-824}} “I also created countless roots of virtue toward the purpose of achieving knowledge of the path. Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, in the distant past there appeared in the world a thus-gone named Extractor of Thorns, with a full hundred thousand hearers. At that time there was a brahmin, who was similar to a great sal tree, named Indradatta. {{page:{number:265,folio:F.133.b}}} He supplied the thus-gone Extractor of Thorns as well as his community of hearers with all their necessities for ten thousand years. Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time Indradatta, the brahmin similar to a great sal tree, was anyone else, do not think so. Because in those days I was Indradatta, the brahmin similar to a great sal tree. Therefore, Mahā­maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas who seek knowledge of the path that leads to cessation as related to knowledge of what is impossible should create virtue, and then conscientiously dedicate it toward knowledge of the path that leads to cessation as related to knowledge of what is impossible.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-825}} “Maudgalyāyana, when the Thus-Gone One was training in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, I made use of the higher training in discipline—applying it and training in it to a great extent. As the karma from doing so ripened, my lifespan became stable, my body came to possess the major marks of a great being, my hands became superb, and I gained the minor marks as well. In addition, I gained the knowledge of what is impossible. I caused numerous beings to uphold the application of the higher training in discipline, and then by those roots of virtue, I gained knowledge of the origin as related to knowledge of what is impossible.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-826}} “If I may extol my application of the higher training in discipline, it is due to the ripening of the karma associated with it that I gained knowledge of cessation as related to knowledge of what is impossible. I also inspired numerous multitudes of beings to genuinely apply the higher training in discipline as well. It is due to the ripening of the karma associated with that that I gained knowledge of the path that leads to cessation as related to knowledge of what is impossible. Thus I realized the state of being utterly dependable. Maudgalyāyana, I have never broken the promises I made in the past when I was in training as a bodhisattva—I followed through with my promises exactly as I made them.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-827}} “Long ago, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a patron-king named Śrīgarbha, who reigned over numerous regions, which were under the single umbrella of his command. {{page:{number:266,folio:F.134.a}}} He was true to his promises and never went against them. At this time there was also a brahmin named Brahmadeva, who paid a visit to King Śrīgarbha and sang to him this verse:
“ ‘Lord Śrīgarbha, you’ve become victorious, Ruling the land and seas with your virtues. Please grant me your daughter for a wife— O King, please help make my wishes bear fruit.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-829}} “The brahmin was an ascetic, his body emaciated. He had blond hair and bared a set of revolting teeth. His eyes were like glass and looked hideous, and his hair was tied up in braids. Seeing him the king was shocked, scared, disgusted, and had goose bumps. He even fell into a state of panic, as he thought, ‘If I don’t give him my daughter, he’ll surely put a curse on me. Nonetheless, I have vowed to serve all sentient beings and shall not go against my word.’ His daughter, whose name was Jana­pada­kalyāṇī—‘Good Lady of the Land’—was beautiful and lovely and she bore all the special features of royalty. He continued to reflect, ‘I have vowed to fulfill the wishes of all sentient beings. Yet this ascetic is too ugly for my daughter, who is so ravishing. I would not be happy if he had her for himself, and therefore I must break my vow.’ He stayed for some time pondering this, absorbed in his thoughts. Eventually his daughter came to him and spoke this verse:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-830}} “ ‘Father, consider and consider well! Please don’t refuse the brahmin’s request. Even my own parents who created me Do not have authority to do that, so please let us marry.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-831}} “When King Śrīgarbha heard what she said, he was pleased, {{page:{number:267,folio:F.134.b}}} delighted, and overjoyed. Feeling joyful, elated, and happy, he offered his daughter Jana­pada­kalyāṇī to the brahmin. The brahmin then took the girl with him and departed. They had a son who also took a wife and had a son, and then took ordination. The root of virtue the king created in fulfilling the brahmin’s wishes led him to be reborn like an ascetic among the gods who make use of others’ emanations. When he had reached the end of the life span of the six classes of desire realm gods, he was again born as a human and attained all of the inalienable qualities. Maudgalyāyana, at that time King Śrīgarbha was none other than me; I was King Śrīgarbha then. Due to that root of virtue I achieved knowledge of what is impossible, never to be caught again in any of the nooses of evil.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-832}} “Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, when I was involved in the trainings of a bodhisattva, I led limitless sentient beings to adopt the roots of virtue. It was due to the roots of virtue from doing so that I achieved knowledge of the origin as related to knowledge of what is impossible. Without a doubt those roots of virtue came to ripen, and when the karma came to ripen I gained realization of the knowledge of cessation as related to knowledge of what is impossible, as well as the perfect major and minor marks. When I formed such roots of virtue, I also led others to such roots of virtue, and felt limitless joy in doing so. Due to the roots of virtue from having done so, I achieved knowledge of the path leading to cessation as related to knowledge of what is impossible. With such knowledge I can accurately discern, for both myself and others, the knowledge of the path that leads to cessation as related to knowledge of what is impossible.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-833}} The Blessed One then proceeded to utter this verse:

Knowledge of the Past
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-834}} “Maudgalyāyana, {{page:{number:268,folio:F.135.a}}} when I, the Thus-Gone One, was training in the practices of a bodhisattva, I always maintained utter mindfulness. For a long time I dwelled by means of the faculty of mindfulness without speaking. Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, in the distant past there appeared in the world a thus-gone named Fear-Proclaiming Master; he was learned and venerable, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman who guided beings, unexcelled, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, a blessed one. The thus-gone Fear-Proclaiming Master had as his principal attendant a monk named Pleasant. For six hundred million years he attended to the thus-gone Fear-Proclaiming Master and pleased him, never displeasing him. He memorized his teachings and never pursued his own interests. In that eon, in that buddha realm alone there were twelve thousand buddhas, and the monk Pleasant was the principal attendant to all of them. At some point later there was a thus-gone one named Achiever of the Strength of Power; the monk Pleasant was his principal attendant as well.

Moreover, I happily rejoiced in others’ roots of virtue, and the roots of virtue from doing so led me to achieve knowledge of the origin as related to knowledge of the past. I dedicated those roots of virtue and that knowledge by the very same knowledge, and due to the roots of virtue from having done so, actualized knowledge of cessation as related to knowledge of the past. Whatever methods I applied in practice, I inspired multitudes of beings toward knowledge of them.

The thus-gone Luminous Wisdom Lamp had a following of one hundred thousand hearers. Once when he was teaching his hearers on the topic of the future there was in the audience a monk named Always Diligent, who thought to himself, ‘How amazing! In the future may I attain insight into unobscured wisdom!’ With that thought in mind he tossed a large golden flower toward the thus-gone Luminous Wisdom Lamp, and made a prayer: ‘How amazing—in the future may this wisdom dawn in me!’ Due to that root of virtue I achieved knowledge of the future. Also due to that root of virtue I came to understand dependent origination. Furthermore, due to that root of virtue I achieved knowledge of the origin as related to knowledge of the future. In general, if the causes and conditions are present, one will accomplish knowledge of the origin as related to knowledge of the future, while such understanding will not come about if those causes are absent. Due to such roots of virtue, I achieved knowledge of cessation as related to knowledge of the future.

Moreover, upon hearing it he felt unfathomable wonder at being in the Thus-Gone One’s presence, and thought to himself, ‘It is amazing how the Thus-Gone One teaches the Dharma with such unhindered eloquence on the topic of the present. How marvelous!’ Feeling such wonder to be in the Thus-Gone One’s presence, he tossed a flower made of a precious substance toward the Thus-Gone One and made a prayer: ‘How amazing!

Lacking any protection or shelter, a bear saved him and took him into his den. There they survived on fruits and roots for seven days. Thinking the man must be suffering from the cold, the bear cradled the man in his arms. After the seven days passed and the storm cleared, they emerged from the den and the bear sent the man off. However, the man disregarded the help that was given to him and led a hunter to the bear so that it was killed. {{page:{number:276,folio:F.139.a}}} In this way ungratefulness brings suffering in the world.

The harm that comes from aging, the harm that comes from sickness, and the harm that comes from dying.

Once there, a hideous piśāca demon arrived. It sat cross-legged in midair in the middle of the dining hall where the king was sitting, and spoke to him: ‘O great lord of the land who seeks the sublime teachings, may you be victorious! I have an excellent instruction I heard from thus-gone ones in the past—if you are interested you may have it.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-939}} “King Brahmadatta then replied to the piśāca demon, ‘O great ghost, I do want the teaching. Whatever you wish is my command!’
“The demon answered, ‘O great lord of the land, if you give me the three things most dear to you—you yourself, your wife, and your son—I will then give you this sublime teaching.’
“ ‘What will you do with us?’ asked the king.
“ ‘I will eat you, but I shall also give you a teaching.’ {{page:{number:290,folio:F.146.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-940}} “King Brahmadatta then glanced to both sides, seeing his wife on his left and his dear son on his right. They told him, ‘Your Majesty, you should give us up immediately, and hear whatever teaching there is that has the capability of liberating from cyclic existence.’
“Maudgalyāyana, the piśāca demon was aware of their noble intention, and so granted them a sublime teaching in verse:
“ ‘If you seek happiness for yourself And others, do not do anything harmful. Fools who do harmful things seeking happiness Will face the consequence of each one.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-942}} “Then King Brahmadatta thought to himself, ‘What an amazing verse of sublime teaching! I would sacrifice as many of my own bodies as there grains of sand in the Ganges for this verse. Having sacrificed that many bodies, one should seek out this verse.’ Standing up, he took his wife with his left hand and his son with his right, and told the piśāca demon:
“ ‘This verse is of immense benefit to me. Whatever pleases you, you shall enjoy it.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-943}} “Maudgalyāyana, the form of the piśāca demon then vanished and its true form was revealed. It then spoke in verse to King Brahmadatta:
“ ‘I commend your courage in giving— You have overcome the sin of stinginess. Your gifts are accepted; May your wishes be fulfilled.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-945}} “King Brahmadatta then asked the ghost, ‘My friend, who exactly are you?’
“He replied, ‘Friend, I am Śakra, lord of the gods. Whatever is the foremost thing you desire, Your Majesty, please ask me.’
“King Brahmadatta then said, ‘O Lord of the Gods, if you will consent to bestowing the most supreme thing of all, please grant that supreme thing which is not born, does not age, does not become sick, does not die, does not feel pain, does not lament, does not suffer, does not experience unhappiness, and is never disturbed.’
“ ‘Your Majesty,’ replied Śakra, ‘I do not possess such a thing. {{page:{number:291,folio:F.146.b}}} However, the Blessed Buddha does possess such a perfect thing. Please request some other supreme thing you desire.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-947}} “King Brahmadatta then addressed Śakra, lord of the gods: ‘You may be lord, but yet you are powerless—all I see is a fool.’
“Śakra became dejected, disgraced like an elephant who has sunk in the mud.
“Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time the one known as King Brahmadatta was anyone else, do not think so. In those days King Brahmadatta was me. Maudgalyāyana, due to those roots of virtue I gained knowledge of the path leading to cessation as related to knowledge of the present. Thus, Maudgalyāyana, those bodhisattva great beings who want to fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, and who moreover wish to achieve knowledge of the path leading to cessation as related to knowledge of the present, should train in giving up all they own, and practice generosity without hesitation.”
Knowledge of Karma
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-949}} “Maudgalyāyana, I also underwent countless trials and deprivations in order to understand karma. Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, in the distant past there was a brahmin named Descendant of Bharadvāja. Once he was traveling to visit someone. He was resting along the way when untimely storm clouds formed in the sky and it began to rain. The brahmin Descendant of Bharadvāja took shelter under a tree without anything to eat, while it continued to rain for seven days. In the hollow of the tree trunk there happened to live an extraordinary rabbit. It came out of its hollow and licked the foot of Descendant of Bharadvāja, who then took the rabbit onto his lap and held it there for the week he was there, petting it with his hand. He looked at the rabbit with affection in his heart and caressed its body. {{page:{number:292,folio:F.147.a}}} With loving gestures he stroked it and with love in his voice and in his heart, he spoke to it, uttering for instance these verses:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-950}} “ ‘Rabbit, it is well that you live here in the forest, To be righteous and follow a virtuous teacher. But, how are you able to live here in this forest? Please grant a reply to my question.

{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-952}} “The rabbit replied:
“ ‘O human brahmin, please hear what I say. Look, O Dharma practitioner, around this forest— There is no grass or anything to drink, But to see a sage like you brings me delight.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-953}} “ ‘Seeing the virtuous, one practices disciplined conduct And becomes glad and joyful at such happiness in the world. Tell me, what deeds have you performed to enter the human realm? And what deeds lead to rebirth as an animal?
“ ‘I would be overjoyed to hear about this. Please choose your words well and tell me.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-955}} “The rabbit continued:
“ ‘In a past life I listened to a Dharma teaching, But then hurt the Dharma teacher— Due to that I ended up as an animal.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-956}} “The brahmin said:
“ ‘I have been here a while, so I must go. Be patient, little one—quench your thirst And eat some grass, you will not die here.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-957}} “The rabbit continued:
“ ‘I am not interested in water, I don’t want grass, and I don’t need speeches. Brahmin, don’t forsake me or go away But look after me and stay here in the forest.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-958}} “The brahmin retorted:
“ ‘But, little one, what could I eat here? There is nothing to drink, nor place to dwell, So how could a brahmin Make a home in this forest?’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-959}} “The rabbit responded:
“ ‘O sage, since you’ve asked: There is no food, nor anything to drink, Not even sesame seeds or rice. I do not have a mat or bedding.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-960}} “ ‘So I’ll give myself to you, O sage— {{page:{number:293,folio:F.147.b}}} You can wear my skin with pleasure, O sage. You will then find pleasure in this visible world. Wearing my skin, please stay here in my forest.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-961}} “The brahmin decided to test him, saying:
“ ‘I will eat you today and make my home in the forest. Please kill yourself and give your body to me— Once I’ve eaten you, I can stay here contentedly.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-962}} “The rabbit replied:
“ ‘I will throw myself in the fire without hesitation; Today you will wear my skin. Once I die you will be happy And the wise will rejoice.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-963}} “To continue to test him, The sage gathered grass and wood And started a fire, then told the rabbit, ‘Roast yourself so I can stay in the forest.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-964}} “The rabbit saw the fire; then, full of faith And without a second thought, It jumped into the flames As if diving into a pool of cool water.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-965}} “The sage was pleased and lovingly Grabbed the rabbit and saved it. ‘Little one, may you live in this forest an eon. I will stay in the forest to help you.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-966}} “Remaining there in the forest, The sage gave the rabbit helpful advice, So that it did countless good deeds And found happiness in the higher realms.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-967}} “What do you think, Maudgalyāyana? Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time the rabbit was anyone else, do not think so. In those days the rabbit was me. And what do you think, Maudgalyāyana? In case you may think that at that time the sage was anyone else, Maudgalyāyana, do not think so. In those days the sage was Śāriputra. Due to those deeds and roots of virtue, I gained knowledge of karma. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, those bodhisattva great beings who wish to fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood should train in knowledge of karma and not mix up the principles of karma. They should also dedicate their merit toward unexcelled and perfect awakening. Maudgalyāyana, {{page:{number:294,folio:F.148.a}}} in this way should bodhisattva great beings understand the knowledge of karma.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-968}} “Maudgalyāyana, when I was training as a bodhisattva in the past I created countless roots of virtue and underwent countless trials and deprivations in order to gain knowledge of the origin as related to knowledge of karma. Long ago in cyclic existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a patron-king named Aśokaśrī, who reigned over numerous regions under the single umbrella of his command. At that time there appeared in the world a thus-gone named Defeater of the Force of Evil. The blessed thus-gone Defeater of the Force of Evil had a community of nine hundred million hearers, all worthy ones whose defilements had ended.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-969}} “Once, sitting in the midst of his nine hundred million hearers, the thus-gone Defeater of the Force of Evil gave a Dharma teaching on the topic of knowledge of the origin as related to knowledge of karma. Present in the audience on that occasion was a bodhisattva great being named Dispeller of Suffering. He stood up from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and then he knelt on his right knee. With his palms together he bowed toward the blessed thus-gone Defeater of the Force of Evil, and supplicated him in the form of a song:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-970}} “ ‘Lord of men, your mind rich with virtue, Self-manifest guide, I ask of you: Protector, how should heirs of the Guide Understand the causes of good actions?
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-971}} “ ‘How can their conduct become pure and detached? How can they follow virtue with pure conduct? What should they do to achieve pure action? O Guide, please tell the causes of pure action!
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-972}} “ ‘How can we achieve purity of action? How can beings make their actions pure? How can we remember the causes of pure actions? O Guide, foremost helmsman, please explain this! {{page:{number:295,folio:F.148.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-973}} “ ‘Lord of men, once your heirs hear your immaculate words On the attitude of pleasant, wholly virtuous conduct And pure, peaceful action , the enactment of impartial conduct, O Guide, they will be well founded in awakening.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-974}} “Maudgalyāyana, then the thus-gone Defeater of the Force of Evil replied to the bodhisattva Dispeller of Suffering, ‘Dispeller of Suffering, you act to help many beings, to bring about many beings’ welfare, and because you care for beings. It is excellent that you have the thought to ask this question to the Thus-Gone One. So, noble son, listen well and keep what I am about to say in your heart.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-975}} The bodhisattva Dispeller of Suffering assented and listened carefully as the Blessed One had directed. The Blessed One then proceeded: ‘Noble son, those bodhisattva great beings who want to fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood should train in giving up pride. They should apply themselves to being an object of all beings’ reverence. They should correctly understand the joy of the Dharma. They should never forsake the mind of awakening. They should please their spiritual guides. They should be indefatigable in their pursuit of the Dharma. They should exert themselves in extensive learning. They should seek out scriptures that are well scrutinized. They should train in discernment. They should also train in discerning individual tenets. They should be skilled in ritual service. They should respect their teachers. They should never be discourteous to their teachers. They should never go against their teachers’ words. They should seek out significant scriptures and shun the other ones that are insignificant. Immersing themselves in the vehicle of bodhisattvas, they should shun all the Lokāyata scriptures; treatises on criminal punishment, sorcery, linguistics, and demonology; the scriptures of Jambhaka; {{page:{number:296,folio:F.149.a}}} works on children’s games, cooking, gambling, acrobatics, magic, commerce, butchery, bartending, sex, and travel; works demonstrating ignorance regarding livelihood; works on sleep or paralysis; treatises that create confusion; works on snake catching; and otherwise any treatises that are at odds with liberation and simply cause more confusion. Why is this, you may ask? Because these types of works are an obstruction to liberation.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-976}} “ ‘Furthermore, Dispeller of Suffering, bodhisattva great beings who want to fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood should exert themselves in being generous, disciplined, and restrained. They should make themselves worthy of attracting sentient beings. Their speech should in all cases be agreeable, and never in the slightest amount or manner be disagreeable, or spoken inopportunely. Thus they should utter words that are appropriate for the occasion.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-977}} “Maudgalyāyana, once there were two friends, one named Dark Joy and the other called Guru. Both belonged to the king’s court. One served the king—that was Guru—and the other, Dark Joy, chased after prostitutes. Guru, the assistant who served the king, spoke in an opportune and appropriate manner, while the one who chased after prostitutes, the assistant Dark Joy, always spoke inopportunely and inappropriately. When the prostitutes knew he had imbibed too much wine and become drunk, they would carry him out on a straw mat {{page:{number:297,folio:F.149.b}}} and dump him on a street corner. Being so different from Guru, that young man uttered inopportune and inappropriate language, which led to him becoming further disturbed. What do you think, Maudgalyāyana? In case you may think that at that time the assistant Guru was anyone else, Maudgalyāyana, do not think so. In those days I was the assistant named Guru. And what do you think, Maudgalyāyana? In case you may think that at that time the assistant Dark Joy was anyone else, Maudgalyāyana, do not think so. In those days the assistant named Dark Joy was Devadatta. He became disturbed from using language that was inopportune and inappropriate. The origin of the happiness I feel lies in the fact that at that time I spoke opportunely and appropriately. The cause that led to the karmic ripening by which Devadatta undergoes so much suffering lies in the inopportune and inappropriate language he uttered.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-978}} “Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should exercise themselves in knowledge of the origin as related to knowledge of karma. {{note:{index:41,id:UT22084-047-001-979}}} Maudgalyāyana, those bodhisattva great beings who live by opportune speech carry out the practice of mindfulness. Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas who live by the strengths can be said to be conscientious. They will never decline in the qualities of a bodhisattva. Maudgalyāyana, what are the qualities of a bodhisattva I refer to? They are what a bodhisattva should never allow to decline, namely the six perfections: the perfection of generosity, the perfection of discipline, the perfection of patience, the perfection of diligence, the perfection of concentration, and the perfection of insight. Maudgalyāyana, these are qualities of bodhisattvas. Bodhisattvas should never let them decline.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-980}} “Bodhisattvas who live by mindfulness {{page:{number:298,folio:F.150.a}}} train in remembering to give. In this way they perfect the meritorious activity of generosity and thus counteract stinginess. Those who counteract stinginess uphold generosity. They have no concerns of possessing anything, and those who have no concerns of possessing anything cut their fetters. Those who cut their fetters are liberated, and those who are liberated are free. Those who are free are beyond observation and pass beyond suffering within the field of nirvāṇa free from any remainder of the aggregates. Maudgalyāyana, these are the qualities of bodhisattvas: bodhisattvas are bound by nothing and never regress. Maudgalyāyana, because bodhisattvas never regress, they should be regarded as teachers by the whole world including gods, and all other beings such as demons, Brahmā, mendicants, and brahmins. They should be regarded as guides, leaders, lamps, illuminators, and similarly as clarifiers, mentors, instructors, soothers, and peacemakers. They should be regarded as beings who bring joy, who enrich, who take the lead, who lead the way, and who bring things to an end. They should be regarded as liberated, as perfected, as illuminators, and as those who bring happiness. They should be regarded as a foundation, a protection, a refuge, as perfected, and as those who bestow fearlessness.
“Why is this, Maudgalyāyana? Because bodhisattvas derive their great compassion from these sentient beings, as they think, ‘Alas! These sentient beings have no protector. Some of them wish to escape suffering and gain the pleasure of desire. Others wish to escape suffering and gain the pleasure of equilibrium. Thus they deviate from the path and go astray, ending up on inferior paths.’ {{page:{number:299,folio:F.150.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-982}} “Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, in the distant past there was a teacher known as Practicing Detachment. He was someone who led sentient beings to freedom and emancipation from the harm of sense pleasures and regarded that state as pure. He led numerous beings to that state and when they became detached from sense pleasures, he would assert that in that moment they had reached nirvāṇa. Thus he was able to establish many of them fully in detachment from sense pleasures. A number of them would then have the idea, ‘I am now perfectly detached from sense pleasures.’ When beings had become detached from sense pleasures, they were told they had achieved nirvāṇa, and that they would never take on a physical form again. He established eighty million beings in this state of acceptance, and they all thought they were liberated. In such a frame of mind, after they died they were reborn in the realm of Brahmā. Witnessing that happen, they concluded, ‘This so-called nirvāṇa is a perverted doctrine. The path leading to this so-called nirvāṇa is a perverted path. Any mendicants or brahmins who espouse such a doctrine of nirvāṇa are preaching falsehoods.’ In fact, after they were born there, although they did see Brahmā’s celestial palace, it immediately vanished and they instead became beings in the great hells. This shows that while other paths may claim to lead directly to liberation, emancipation from sense pleasures is not liberation.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-983}} “Some mendicants and brahmins hold that liberation can take place through the bliss of concentration. Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, in the distant past there was a sage named Inferior Class. He perceived sense pleasures to be fetters and so renounced them. He took ordination and eventually achieved the first absorption level, with both conception and discernment. Then he thought, ‘No matter what I direct my conception and discernment toward, I am not completely at peace. {{page:{number:300,folio:F.151.a}}} There must be something more tranquil and magnificent than this.’ With that in mind, he achieved a non-conceptual state of meditation. Then he thought to himself, ‘There is no longer any conception or discernment—this must be nirvāṇa. It is so tranquil and magnificent . Without conception or discernment there is no need to continue to reincarnate—there is no longer the slightest appropriation, and so I have passed into nirvāṇa in the realm without remainder.’ Emerging from his state of absorption, he went on to establish six hundred thousand beings in the same state of acceptance. Each of them also thought, ‘Now that I am rid of conception and discernment, there will be no more rebirth. With no need to continue taking rebirth, I have achieved nirvāṇa.’ So pleased with their state of acceptance and experiences, luminous celestial palaces manifested before them. Beholding those palaces, however, they had the thought, ‘This so-called nirvāṇa is a fallacy. Those mendicants and brahmins who preach about nirvāṇa are misguided. Why? Because there cannot be a celestial palace in the state of nirvāṇa.’ In fact, as soon as they beheld them, the celestial palaces disappeared, and they fell into the great hell realms.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-984}} “At this time there was a brahmin known as Possessor of Myriad Knowledges who had the five superknowledges as well as extraordinary vision. He could see those beings who had ended up in the great hell, and thought to himself, ‘Alas, the state of this world is really in decline. These beings’ misconceptions have landed them in the great hell.’ With this in mind he rested in a state of absorption, and by the miraculous powers created by his equilibrium, all those beings in the great hell were cooled. They also heard a voice saying, ‘Listen, all of you! There is a nirvāṇa—you have just not heard about it. You have come to take something that is not nirvāṇa to be nirvāṇa—this is why you were reborn in hell. {{page:{number:301,folio:F.151.b}}} You all must totally give up these ideas! If you do, you will achieve nirvāṇa!’ When the beings heard these words, they gave up their ideas and again conceived of nirvāṇa. As soon as they did so, they died within their existence in the great hell and were transported into the presence of the teacher Possessor of Myriad Knowledges.
“Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time the teacher Possessor of Myriad Knowledges was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was the teacher Possessor of Myriad Knowledges. Maudgalyāyana, for long sentient beings have been deceived by misconceptions. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should rid themselves of observing distorted conceptions. They should apply effort to understand the essential characteristics of phenomena. They should also seek out spiritual guides.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-986}} “Maudgalyāyana, the ‘awakening’ of bodhisattvas happens in association with a spiritual guide. Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should not follow the vehicle of the hearers; neither should they follow the vehicle of the solitary buddhas. Why is this, you may ask, Maudgalyāyana? Faulty discipline and wrong views are not a bad influence on bodhisattvas compared to the negative influence that the vehicles of the hearers and solitary buddhas have on them. Why is this? Faulty discipline cannot ruin a bodhisattva’s discipline, nor can wrong views ruin a bodhisattva’s view. Why is this, you may ask? Faulty discipline cannot make a bodhisattva’s discipline faulty, nor can wrong views distort a bodhisattva’s view. {{page:{number:302,folio:F.152.a}}} However, the adherents of the vehicle of the hearers and the vehicle of the solitary buddhas cannot lead bodhisattvas to undefiled knowledge. It is for this reason that adherents of the vehicles of hearers and solitary buddhas are a bad influence for bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-987}} “Moreover, for those who are well founded in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas, it is permissible to fraternize with people with faulty discipline and distorted ideas, while this is not the case for the vehicles of the hearers and solitary buddhas. Bodhisattvas have distanced themselves from faulty discipline and distorted ideas. Followers of the hearers and solitary buddhas should be viewed as murderers, since they terminate the presence in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas. Those bodhisattvas who are grounded in the vehicle beyond analysis become unable to pursue it. In view of this, bodhisattvas should not fraternize with followers of the vehicles of the hearers and solitary buddhas. It is incongruous for lions to keep company with foxes. In that sense, all followers of the vehicles of the hearers and solitary buddhas should be regarded like foxes, whereas those who are grounded in the vehicle of bodhisattvas should be considered analogous to lions. Why is that?
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-988}} “Hearers are involved with benefiting themselves, while bodhisattvas are involved in helping both themselves and others. Hearers only know their own path, while bodhisattvas understand fully the paths of all sentient beings as well as their own. Hearers only purify their own minds, while bodhisattvas purify all sentient beings’ minds as well as their own. Hearers and solitary buddhas pacify their own afflictions, while bodhisattvas pacify others’ afflictions as well as their own. Hearers use their one path to escape, while bodhisattvas traverse the great path. Hearers and solitary buddhas abandon the afflictions but not the habits for them, {{page:{number:303,folio:F.152.b}}} while bodhisattvas, upon fully awakening to buddhahood, abandon not only the afflictions but also the habits to which they are connected. Hearers attain nirvāṇa via a path taught by someone else, while bodhisattvas attain nirvāṇa by means of a path that is self-manifest. The sublime Dharma of the hearers does not last, while the sublime Dharma of the bodhisattvas remains after they awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. Hearers and solitary buddhas lack the excellent powers, while bodhisattvas gain the excellent ten powers upon fully awakening to buddhahood. Hearers and solitary buddhas lack the excellent types of fearlessness, while buddhas master the excellent types of fearlessness. Hearers and solitary buddhas lack the thus-gone ones’ correct understanding, while the thus-gone ones possess extraordinarily correct understanding. Hearers and solitary buddhas all lack the marks, while the thus-gone ones possess extraordinary marks.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-989}} “Those who train in the thus-gone ones’ correct understanding can be described by means of the following analogy. They can be compared to people who are ignorant of the great trichiliocosm, which causes their minds to be entirely enmeshed in limitless negativity and non-virtue, but who later gain the same qualities as a buddha. Those who cultivate these qualities of bodhisattvas realize this path and thus cannot be deluded by anyone in the world, including the gods. Thus, when bodhisattvas die in this life, they are irreversible from unexcelled and perfect awakening, and have the thought, ‘Alas! How pointlessly and blindly these sentient beings immerse themselves in all that is the opposite of virtue. Controlled by negativity, whenever they encounter a desirable sight, sound, smell, taste, or texture, they become inharmonious and dreadful. {{page:{number:304,folio:F.153.a}}} They lack correct understanding of deliverance.’ For instance, if someone is bitten by a venomous snake, they will think to attack the snake rather than trying to remove the poison. Similarly, foolish ordinary beings become unhappy thinking about the sense pleasures of the gods instead of trying to remove their own afflictions. Why is this, you may ask? It is because they do not correctly understand the cause of suffering. Therefore bodhisattva great beings who want to benefit sentient beings and counteract what does not benefit them should understand precisely how the afflictions serve as the causes of karma.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-990}} “Maudgalyāyana, I have explained how to understand and recognize that afflictions lead to the appropriation of karma, just as I have explained how the end of defilements is not understood or perceived. How is this cognized and perceived, you may ask? Through correct mental engagement and incorrect mental engagement. What is incorrect mental engagement? It refers to the three ways of darkness. What is correct then? The three gateways to liberation: emptiness, absence of marks, and absence of wishes. Once one has a basis in emptiness, there is no longer any doubt or reservation about there being a self, something that is ‘mine,’ or something that is permanent, stable, tranquil, or eternal. Once one has realized this with certainty, one overcomes any darkness and confusion regarding the absence of self and something being ‘mine,’ just as daylight eliminates darkness. Similarly, once one has certainty about emptiness, one will no longer be threatened by the darkness. This is how the Blessed One gains knowledge, and how the Thus-Gone One’s ten powers are revealed. This can be said about knowledge of what is possible, knowledge of the origin as related to knowledge of what is possible, knowledge of cessation as related to knowledge of what is possible, knowledge of the path leading to cessation as related to knowledge of what is possible, and so on, all the way through to knowledge of the path leading to cessation as related to knowledge of omniscience.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-991}} “Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, those noble sons and daughters {{page:{number:305,folio:F.153.b}}} who are well grounded in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas and who wish to fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood should have knowledge of the three ways of dark confusion. Moreover, they should correctly understand the three gateways to liberation and aspire toward the ten powers. They should develop compassion for sentient beings who are obscured by the transitory collection and darkness, and practice for the sake of revealing what sentient beings’ darknesses are.”

In one particular past life he was a universal monarch named Mahāprabha , endowed with the seven royal treasures. From a sage named Intense Splendor, who possessed the five superknowledges, he learned that those who kill follow a course to the lower realms, that those who forsake killing follow a course to the higher realms, and that those who bring an end to the afflictions follow a course to omniscience.

It would be so excellent and outstanding if I could know the paths that lead to all destinations.’ {{note:{index:42,id:UT22084-047-001-994}}} He also wondered, ‘What are the causes of the knowledge of the paths that lead to all destinations?’ Thinking further, he realized, ‘The causes that create the paths that lead to all destinations lie in the formation of karma. But what are the causes that lead to the formation of karma? The causes that lead to the formation of karma are the afflictions of desire, anger, and ignorance. But what are the causes of desire, anger, and ignorance? The causes leading to karma and the afflictions lie in distorted mental engagement. {{page:{number:306,folio:F.154.a}}} Distorted mental engagement produces afflictions, which in turn lead to the formation of physical, verbal, and mental karma. Prompted by distorted mental engagement, the six sense faculties are formed, on the basis of which more afflictions come about. Then again afflictions lead to the formation of karma, and that karma ripens into further formation of the six sense faculties. This immense amount of past suffering is what is not understood. What have sentient beings failed in and what is it they do not correctly understand? What knowledge will lead to the end of suffering and how can it be achieved?’ To this he told himself, ‘One who has no afflictions will understand correctly. Without afflictions then, no karma will be created. When no karma is created, the six sense faculties will not be formed. When no karma is created, that is nirvāṇa. To be distorted is cyclic existence, while to be undistorted is nirvāṇa. What is undertaken by distortion is undone through being undistorted. By distortion one revolves in the wheel of cyclic existence, while by being undistorted one turns the wheel of Dharma. One is bound by distortion and freed by being undistorted. Whoever understands this becomes free from the paths of cyclic existence, eradicates their associated suffering, and achieves the path of nirvāṇa.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-995}} “Once Mahāprabha attained knowledge of the six sense faculties as the ripening of all karma, he entered among the multitudes of beings. Due to his roots of virtue he then came to understand all of the topics of knowledge. First he practiced all types of craftsmanship. Then, as a way of taking care of all sentient beings, he taught the science of medicine to treat their physical ailments. Having formed the wish that sentient beings stay healthy, in order for them to acquire some resources, he next taught them conventional modes of prudent conduct. Then he taught them archery so that they might gain further wealth and protect it. {{page:{number:307,folio:F.154.b}}} After that he taught them astrology so that their goals would be accomplished. Finally, he taught them to understand how to become liberated so that they might overcome suffering and gain happiness. Thus he taught a variety of skills and crafts to eliminate sentient beings’ suffering.
“Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time the sage named Hiraṇyavatī was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was the sage Hiraṇyavatī. Endeavoring to help all sentient beings, I taught them knowledge of every type of skill and vocation.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-997}} The Blessed One then uttered these verses:
“At that time, as Hiraṇyavatī the sage, I was a strict ascetic. In order to help sentient beings, I taught them various vocations.

Nearby him there lived a sage named Vikrāntagāmin who lived off fruits. One day Vikrāntagāmin the sage went off into the forest looking for fruit. In the forest he found a fruit tree replete with an abundance of fruit. At the base of the tree, though, was a poisonous snake. It could propel venom with its breath and, {{page:{number:308,folio:F.155.a}}} once airborne, the poison would incinerate everything within its field of vision. When the sage approached, the poisonous snake was fast asleep, but he thought, ‘If this poisonous snake were to wake up, it would torch everything in sight. I’ll use my magical powers to cast it into the pond that keeps the world’s poisonous snakes.’ And so with his magical powers he hurled the poisonous snake into the pond. As soon as it landed in the pond of poisonous snakes it died and the other snakes devoured it. Then the sage Vikrāntagāmin said to his students, ‘Young brahmins, the more afflictions there are being formed and produced at present, the greater the suffering that is being assumed. Just look here. I can see that this poisonous snake died in the pond of venomous snakes. This poisonous snake was in fact formerly a human. He did nothing to counteract his faults, and so he incurred the fault of hatred, which escalated and now he suffers from that very same fault.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1003}} “Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, one must counteract one’s present faults. All the misfortune that sentient beings fall into happens because they have done nothing to counteract their afflictions in the present. All the suffering they underwent in the past happened because of doing nothing to counteract those present afflictions. In just the same way, mendicants and brahmins have gone through suffering in the past. Those sentient beings who experienced happiness in the past did so as a result of the contemporaneous positivity they fostered in the past. Whatever happiness sentient beings will experience in the future—it is all due to fostering positivity in the present that one experiences happiness in the future. Whatever suffering sentient beings undergo in the present, it all occurs because they do nothing to counteract their present afflictions. Whatever happiness sentient beings experience in the present, {{page:{number:309,folio:F.155.b}}} it all occurs because they counteract their present afflictions. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, one must train in eliminating one’s present afflictions. Maudgalyāyana, those noble sons and daughters who are well grounded in the vehicle of the bodhisattvas should train in this way. Whatever happiness sentient beings experienced in the past, it all occurred due to the good qualities they fostered in that moment. Whatever happiness sentient beings will experience in the future, it will occur due to the good qualities they foster in that moment. And just the same, whatever happiness sentient beings experience in the present, it is all caused by the good qualities they foster in the present. Even right now in the present, they immediately experience happiness.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1004}} “Accordingly, the cause of present suffering lies in the cause of the present. Thus, one must understand and analyze anything that functions as such a cause. Through the thorough comprehension of non-virtue we arrive at what is called the imputed cause , while proper mental engagement with virtue is known as the enacted cause. {{note:{index:43,id:UT22084-047-001-1005}}} These make up the causes of cyclic existence and nirvāṇa. Bodhisattvas must counteract the causes of cyclic existence and foster the causes of nirvāṇa.

Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a magician named Gatherer of Myriad Creations who was well versed in magical creations. He exhibited a variety of magical creations in front of large audiences, whether it was the forms of elephants, horses, bulls, or persons. There was no one who caught on to his tricks.
“What do you think, Maudgalyāyana? In case you may think that at that time the magician was anyone else, Maudgalyāyana, do not think so. In those days I was the magician. In those days {{page:{number:310,folio:F.156.a}}} I performed numerous magical illusions for sentient beings, just like now I teach beings that everything is like a magical illusion. Just as a magician performs a variety of magical illusions, I cause the perception of others to realize the paths that lead to all destinations, and in their perception I make them train on the path to nirvāṇa. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should train in such perceptions.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1008}} “Maudgalyāyana, I created innumerable roots of virtue in order to gain knowledge of the origin as related to knowledge of the paths that lead to all destinations. Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there appeared in the world one named Sandalwood Heir who had served past victors, and who had limitless faith in as well as limitless fondness for the Thus-Gone One. He saw that in order to attain the buddhas’ wisdom, the paths that lead to all destinations must cease. He thought to himself, ‘Complete awakening to buddhahood does not take place through the knowledge of the noble ones, nor can it happen on the basis of any other knowledge. What is the reason for this? It is because such knowledge grasps to something as being real, whether that grasping is to the path, or to nirvāṇa. Complete awakening to buddhahood can only take place when there is no longer the slightest bit of grasping to anything as real. Thus, one must not fixate on knowledge of the paths that lead to all destinations. It is like the analogy of traveling in a boat: once you reach the other shore, you leave the boat behind. In the same way, after attaining complete awakening, you must leave behind the knowledge of the paths that lead to all destinations. As we must, without clinging, regard all phenomena as lacking a concrete essence, so too we must, without any observation, give up knowledge of the paths that lead to all destinations. In this sense we should regard the teachings as like a boat.’ {{page:{number:311,folio:F.156.b}}}
“What do you think, Maudgalyāyana? In case you may think that at that time Sandalwood Heir was anyone else, Maudgalyāyana, do not think so. In those days I was Sandalwood Heir. Thus, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should have no observation of anything.

He was incredibly skilled at the lute—in fact just by plucking one string of his lute he could make it sound like a flute, a lute, a nakula , a beautiful voice, cymbals, a drum, or the sound of ten million other instruments. He was similarly skilled in lyrical composition and embellishment, not to mention at playing the lute itself. He performed before large audiences, and no matter what he played, the audience loved it. His lute never malfunctioned, and he was able to delight his audience with every song he played. As much of an expert as he had become in the art of lute-playing, he found himself going off to a solitary place and reflecting, ‘Alas! How beguiled these beings are by the sound of my lute! And yet they fail to understand that such a sound is transient. Those who understand appearances and realize all that can be seen are called “noble ones.” Just to come to a correct understanding of this on a relative level is to achieve acceptance that phenomena are unborn.’ Achieving such acceptance himself, he went on to lead untold hundreds of billions of beings to the irreversible stage.

Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattva great beings should think as follows: ‘Alas, the sound of a lute is entirely transitory. As it arises, it does not come from anywhere nor, as it ceases, does it go anywhere. While on a relative level it can be said to begin and end, fundamentally it is not anything that can be apprehended. Anything whose nature is to originate and cease, such cessation is said to be merely on a relative level.’ One should become skilled in the practice of engagement.

The world was forty thousand leagues wide and flat as the palm of a hand, and there were many trees but none of them had thorns. It had everything that this present Sahā world does, except that it was free of any defects. At that time there appeared in the world a thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha named Defeater of Darkness; he was learned and venerable, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman who guided beings, unexcelled, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, a blessed one. The thus-gone Defeater of Darkness lived to be six hundred trillion years old. It happened that at that time in his buddhafield, every sentient being that was born suffered sickness and ailments. Besides those beings who remained healthy, and those who eventually died of natural causes at the end of their human life, the others died along with their physical aggregates and were reborn with the same fortune as the gods of Making Use of Others’ Emanations.

Knowledge of the Several Elements
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1014}} “Maudgalyāyana, in the past when I was training in the practices of a bodhisattva, I created countless roots of virtue for the sake of gaining knowledge of the several elements. Long ago in limitless cyclic existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a brahmin named Bearer of Victory, who was like a great sal tree. He was wise, bright, prudent, knowledgeable, well informed, intelligent by nature, and introspective. Once, when thinking about good qualities and faults, he settled his mind in a disengaged state and began to wonder, ‘Where did the basis of faults come from? And where did the basis of good qualities come from?’ Pondering that, without anyone else’s assistance, knowledge welled up from within himself, and he concluded, ‘We become afflicted because we do nothing to counteract the various afflictions happening in the present. If we do counteract the afflictions happening in the present, we will not become afflicted. If we obstruct the wholesome qualities happening in the present, we will not foster goodness. If we foster the good qualities happening in the present, we will foster goodness.’ {{page:{number:314,folio:F.158.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1015}} “As the brahmin Bearer of Victory, who was like a great sal tree, then learned to discern with precision his wholesome qualities that were occurring from his unwholesome qualities to be counteracted, he was able to foster the wholesome qualities that were occurring and reject the unwholesome qualities that were occurring. As he abandoned his unwholesome qualities and utilized the wholesome ones, he achieved absorption. He achieved such an absorption that he was able to permanently eliminate all unwholesomeness and develop wholesome qualities. He continued to practice in that way through to completion, mastery, and total assimilation, such that for eight million eons he avoided falling into misfortune.

Due to those roots of virtue, I have now abandoned the afflictions including the links of their habitual tendencies, and achieved wisdom that is unobscured in relation to phenomena.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1017}} Then venerable Maudgalyāyana said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, it is amazing the way the Blessed One, without ever being discouraged, donned the great armor so well and became unsurpassedly and completely awakened for the sake of others.”
The Blessed One then replied to venerable Maudgalyāyana, “Yes, Maudgalyāyana, the thus-gone ones don this great armor to bring sentient beings caught in the current to safety. Maudgalyāyana, if you do not protect yourself, you cannot help others. This way you can help others by paying no heed to risks to life and limb. {{page:{number:315,folio:F.158.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1018}} “Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a man named Chief Water God, who was the chief of a region of peaceful villages, cities, and towns. He was rich, wealthy, prosperous, had many resources, many possessions, was endowed with numerous assets and goods, and owned jewels, pearls, beryl stones, conch shells, crystals, coral, silver, and gold. He was also wise, bright, prudent, and compassionate; he had the wish to help all sentient beings.
“At that time the king who ruled over these peaceful towns and cities was a spiritually-minded Dharma king named Bandhumat. He was rivaled by a powerful king named Severe God who commanded a large army and, unsatisfied with the extent of his kingdom, had his mind set on invading other territories. Organizing the four divisions of his army, he advanced toward the territory of King Bandhumat to conquer it.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1019}} “At that point King Bandhumat addressed his ministers, saying, ‘O village chiefs, this King Severe God, being unsatisfied with his own kingdom, is now advancing with his troops, forces, and armies to take over mine. Please think about what we can do, O village chiefs.’
“Some responded, ‘We need to muster courage! If we are brave they can be repelled!’ Others answered, ‘We should donate our wealth to protect the kingdom. That way we can properly guard the kingdom and the kingdom can flourish!’ Others said, ‘We should leave it to the ministers and cabinet ministers. The cabinet ministers should take charge!’ Still others said, ‘We should gather our forces and use military action to defend ourselves!’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1021}} “Finally, King Bandhumat approached the city chief Water God and said to him, ‘Water God, you must know—King Severe God {{page:{number:316,folio:F.159.a}}} is dissatisfied with his own kingdom and so is now coming to conquer my land. What should be done?’
The city chief Water God then replied to King Bandhumat, ‘Your Highness, whatever I am capable of, I will do. Whatever wealth I possess, I will donate. You may try to use magical spells, but spells will not be enough to stage a defense—the army will still advance. So to succeed, you could send a messenger and offer an elephant. However, that also will not be enough to repel them—their army will still advance.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1022}} “King Bandhumat then dispatched a messenger to the rival king to say, ‘I beg you: Let’s both just be satisfied with our own kingdoms—I with mine and you with yours. Let us form a truce—I implore you to retreat.’ Continuing, he said, ‘Your livelihood will soon be passed on to others. My friend, you should therefore understand how to sustain yourself with just one meal, with just one set of clothes, and with just one bed, and to stay with just one wife. Why is this, you may ask? The wise do not get caught up in quarrels with others, for one is not able to sustain multiple world systems. Someone may own a whole mountain of gold and yet still not be satisfied, but desire to gain even more. Please reflect on this, my friend, and be generous. Why? Because wise people should learn contentment. When acting in this agreeable manner, you will not be overtaken by those more overcome by desire. If you kill me, the kingdom will be yours, though if I kill you, the kingdom will be mine.’ Such was the letter that he sent with the messenger.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1023}} “King Bandhumat then thought, {{page:{number:317,folio:F.159.b}}} ‘There are so many worldly elements, and it is due to our attachment to the elements that we experience suffering. Whenever there is an element, there is a need for people’s material things; if there were no elements, there would be no need for people’s material things. Since taking on elements in the past, though we pursue material things, we just suffer more. Why should we suffer due to the elements? If I continue to create this, I will only continue to suffer.’ Reflecting in this way, he gave up his kingdom and took ordination. Developing in the four abodes of Brahmā, he then took rebirth in the realm of Brahmā. Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time King Bandhumat was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was King Bandhumat. At that time I gave up the defects of the several elements. Since I still now perceive the faults of the several elements, I am free from appropriation.

Once he wondered, ‘What is this self that governs as the lord of humans? By which human name does the self govern as the lord?’ He then concluded, ‘It must be the eighteen elements. What is the origin and basis of these eighteen elements of human beings?’ Concerning this he concluded, ‘They are created by karma, which is itself of three types: the type born out of desire, the type born out of anger, and the type born out of ignorance. Karma born out of desire leads to the formation of the realms of five classes of beings: the hells, the animal realm, the realm of the Lord of Death, the human world, and the god realm. Karma born out of anger leads to {{page:{number:318,folio:F.160.a}}} the formation of the realms of three classes of beings: the hells, the animal realm, and the realm of the Lord of Death. Karma born out of ignorance also leads to the formation of the realms of five classes of beings: the hells, the animal realm, the realm of the Lord of Death, the human realm, and the god realm. How is this? Desire functions via five senses, while anger functions via three, and ignorance functions via five. How, exactly? Any locus of our desire is likewise a locus of ignorance. Anger is only a locus of the lower realms. Thus, they are referred to as “the several elements.”

Maudgalyāyana, in case you may have any doubts or hesitations so as to think that at that time King Brahmadeva was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was King Brahmadeva.

Each brahmin was offered an appropriate dish, while the majority of the offering ceremony was arranged on a golden platform, and women carried out the distribution of gifts. A different woman distributed a gift to each brahmin, with each woman making a particular offering to each brahmin. They were allowed to accept what they liked or leave what they did not. Each enjoyed to the utmost whatever he liked and could refuse whatever he did not like.

Once he wondered to himself, ‘What makes these sentient beings appear in so many different colors, {{page:{number:322,folio:F.162.a}}} in so many different shapes, making so many different sounds, with their various virtues, various classes, various family lines, and various names? What are the causes and conditions that lead to this?’
“Yet, since he had no knowledge of the present, he was unable to answer. He then thought, ‘What mendicant or brahmin could explain this matter?’ In pursuit of this knowledge he sent men everywhere in the ten directions, ordering them, ‘Please go find out: in this world what mendicant, brahmin, teacher, or teacher’s son understands this matter and can eliminate my doubts about it?’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1037}} “The prince’s father, King Susthita, then told him, ‘My son, what you have in mind is inconceivable. What you have entrusted them to do is unfeasible. Son, your contemplations will merely disturb you and disturb the king as well. You will never come to a conclusion about something that is inconceivable. Why do I say this, my son? Because there are no answers to these questions. Please just enjoy the kingdom—revel in the entire world as a lord of pleasures. But give up your pursuit, my son—thinking of such meaningless things will only make you tired and disturbed!’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1038}} “Prince Kāruṇika then addressed King Susthita, saying, ‘Your Majesty, please do not let the dense darkness remain that way! The subjects in your land include people of lovely color, ugly color, and some that are perfect in every regard. They include beautiful people and ugly ones, people of high class and low class, rich people and poor people, foolish people and clever ones, people who know a variety of trades, those who have a craft and those who are learning one, people who are poor at first but later become rich through effort, and people who are ill and then recover from their illness. Your Majesty, it should be understood in this way and in this manner. {{page:{number:323,folio:F.162.b}}} If these things have causes, I do not know them. Your Majesty, my lack of knowledge of something does not mean that it does not exist. There are many trades I do not know, and what I do understand is not always known to those of other trades. Such knowledge does exist, Your Highness, and yet I do not possess it. Therefore, I am asking my questions to wise and well-respected mendicants and brahmins, to those whose insight is well respected.’
“King Susthita then replied to Prince Kāruṇika, ‘My son, by all means, go ahead and ask your questions to those mendicants and brahmins whose wisdom is well respected and whose insight is well respected.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1039}} “At that time there lived in the world a thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha named Jyotiṣprabhā; he was learned and venerable, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman who guided beings, unexcelled, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, a blessed one. Once, Prince Kāruṇika heard a voice in the sky saying, ‘The thus-gone called Jyotiṣprabhā is living in the world and will answer your questions!’ So when the night was over, Prince Kāruṇika went before King Susthita and told him, ‘Your Majesty, you should know this: Your Majesty, last night while I was sleeping, I heard a voice in the sky saying, “The thus-gone called Jyotiṣprabhā is living in the world and will answer your questions!” ’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1040}} “King Susthita then replied to Prince Kāruṇika, ‘My son, where does this thus-gone one named Jyotiṣprabhā live?’ At that moment the thus-gone Jyotiṣprabhā was aware of what King Susthita was thinking and wondering. Manifesting the miraculous powers he had, he miraculously illuminated the entire eastern region. Prince Kāruṇika and King Susthita then beheld the Blessed One, {{page:{number:324,folio:F.163.a}}} the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Jyotiṣprabhā, and due to the light, they could also see his entire buddha realm. They felt faith in the blessed thus-gone Jyotiṣprabhā. With such faith in their hearts, Prince Kāruṇika went before the thus-gone Jyotiṣprabhā along with six hundred thousand other beings. Paying great reverence to the thus-gone Jyotiṣprabhā, they sat off to one side. Sitting off to one side, Prince Kāruṇika then sang his questions to the Blessed One in song:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1041}} “ ‘Peerless Teacher, guardian of beings, I ask you who are skilled in healing, Please explain, O Guide, why do different beings Have such a variety of elements and traits?
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1042}} “ ‘Please explain, Great Sage and Guide, Why is there such a variety— The abundance of different colors, shapes, and castes, Births, classes, sounds, and names?

{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1045}} “Aware of what Prince Kāruṇika had in mind, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Jyotiṣprabhā smiled. Noticing the smile, Prince Kāruṇika prayed, ‘May I attain buddhahood!’ and then asked the Thus-Gone One in verse:
“ ‘Guardian whose smile benefits the world, Please grant me prophecy So that anyone who hears it Will become a peerless self-arisen one.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1047}} “ ‘Lord of men, looking at your retinue Of divine beings, lions among men, Supreme among men, please speak and dispel my doubts, {{page:{number:325,folio:F.163.b}}} That they may receive prophesies.’

{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2340}} “Maudgalyāyana, in case you may have any doubts or reservations, thinking that at that time Prince Kāruṇika was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was Prince Kāruṇika. For this reason, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should gain knowledge of all treatises. Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas who are knowledgeable about all treatises enter into the state of omniscience. Why is this, Maudgalyāyana? It is because making a composition about omniscient wisdom means to be knowledgeable about all treatises. Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas who are knowledgeable about all treatises come to take on the disposition of the authors of those treatises. By this identity they teach the treatises. You should know that in this regard the Thus-Gone One’s knowledge of the path that leads to cessation as related to knowledge of the several elements refers to omniscience. Why is this? Afflictions can be inferred from the presence of karma. Due to these afflictions further karma is formed. Mind can be inferred from the presence of the afflictions. Due to the presence of involvement in afflictions, one can infer the presence of mind that is attached, angry, or deluded. Based on the presence of mind one can infer the presence of the person. In this way the Thus-Gone One declares sentient beings’ transmigrations. For instance, ‘Because of creating this karma, this individual will transmigrate as a hell being.’ Or, ‘Because of creating this karma, this individual will transmigrate to be born as an animal.’ Or, ‘Because of creating this karma, this individual will transmigrate to the realm of the Lord of Death.’ Or, ‘Because of creating this karma, this individual will transmigrate into the class of demigods.’ Or, ‘Because of creating this karma, this individual will transmigrate as a human.’ Or, ‘Because of creating this karma, this individual will transmigrate to the higher realms.’ {{page:{number:326,folio:F.164.a}}} Or, ‘Because of creating this karma, this individual will transmigrate to nirvāṇa.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1049}} “Consider this analogy: An artist or their skilled apprentice may clean a plank of wood or wipe a wall thoroughly and then apply paint to it; having properly done so, whatever form he or she then wishes to paint can then manifest. It is due to inference based on such actions that the artist becomes known as a skilled artist. Similarly, Maudgalyāyana, afflictions can be deduced based on the presence of karma; and in the same manner, a certain karma will be created due to the presence of an affliction. It may arise from desire, from anger, from ignorance, from desire and anger, from desire and ignorance, from anger and desire, from anger and ignorance, from ignorance and desire, or from ignorance and anger—in any case the presence of an affliction can be deduced based on the presence of karma, just as the individual can be deduced based on the presence of an affliction.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1050}} “Thus, you should understand that a person appears based on the formation of karma in this way: ‘This individual must be a hell being, dwelling among hell beings. This other individual must be an animal, living in the animal realm. This other individual must be a being in the realm of the Lord of Death, dwelling in the realm of the Lord of Death. This other individual must be a demigod, dwelling in the demigod realms. This other individual must be a human, dwelling in the realm of humans. This other individual must be a god, dwelling in the god realms. This other individual must have attained nirvāṇa, and dwells in nirvāṇa.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1051}} “In this way, from the presence of karma, afflictions are inferred; from the presence of afflictions, individuals are inferred; {{page:{number:327,folio:F.164.b}}} from individuals, transmigrations are inferred; from transmigrations, types of ripening are inferred; from the presence of types of ripening, cyclic existence is inferred; from the presence of cyclic existence, the suffering of cyclic existence is inferred; and from the presence of the suffering of cyclic existence, karma and afflictions are inferred. When suffering and the afflictions come to an end, there is freedom. When afflictions come to an end, karma comes to an end. When karma comes to an end, there is no formation. When there is no formation, that is nirvāṇa. What leads to nirvāṇa, you may ask? Nirvāṇa is the transcendence of this very suffering, just as rubbing sticks together sets them ablaze, yet the fire dies when the wood runs out. There is no other fire than that—when the wood is finished the fire dies. In the same way, when karma and afflictions come to an end, one transcends suffering. There is no other suffering than that—that is the transcendence of suffering. Nirvāṇa happens when karma and afflictions come to an end.

In the buddha realm of the thus-gone Master of the Three Realms there was a brahmin, who was similar to a sal tree, named Moon Eyebrows. He was a chanter and mantra holder, and had mastered the threefold knowledge, as well as grammar and ritual sciences, including history, rhetoric, the scriptures of the Lokāyata, and the scriptures on ritual offerings. He was born into the lineage of those with the characteristics of a great being.

He thought, ‘Any great being who comes to possess the thirty-two marks of a great being other than by my mantra teachings must be one of two types, and could not be anything else. If he is a house dweller, he will become a universal emperor, ruling as lord over the four continents. As a spiritually inclined Dharma king, he will possess the seven treasures. The seven treasures are the precious wheel, the precious elephant, the precious horse, the precious jewel, the precious queen, the precious steward, and the precious minister.

I must examine whether this blessed thus-gone named Master of the Three Realms possesses the thirty-two marks of a great being or not. If I see that he does possess the thirty-two marks of a great being, {{page:{number:329,folio:F.165.b}}} I will know that he is to be regarded as a thus-gone.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1055}} “With that the brahmin Moon Eyebrows, who was similar to a sal tree, paid a visit to the blessed thus-gone Master of the Three Realms along with sixty other great brahmin householders. After exchanging pleasantries with Thus-Gone One Master of the Three Realms, they sat off to one side. Sitting to the side, the brahmin Moon Eyebrows, who was similar to a sal tree, wondered about the blessed thus-gone Master of the Three Realms’ thirty-two marks of a great being. Then he saw that the blessed thus-gone Master of the Three Realms indeed had the thirty-two marks of a great being. Moon Eyebrows wondered, however, about two of blessed thus-gone Master of the Three Realms’ marks of a great being in particular: he had doubts about whether his genitals were concealed in a sheath and whether his tongue was long.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1056}} “The blessed thus-gone Master of the Three Realms was aware of the brahmin Moon Eyebrows’ thoughts, and so he extended his tongue from his mouth to lick both his cheeks entirely from eye to ear before licking his ear lobes. Witnessing such signs, exactly as they ought to appear, the great brahmin householder also saw that the Thus-Gone One’s genitals were indeed concealed in a sheath. Thus, he no longer had any reservations about the Thus-Gone One’s thirty-two marks of a great being. Without any doubts, he stood up from his seat and knelt on his right knee. Joining his palms, he bowed toward the thus-gone Master of the Three Realms. Bowing to his feet, he kissed them, and then raised them up.

“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a king named Virtuous Vision, who maintained his kingdom in a righteous manner. At the same time there was also a thus-gone one named Unhindered Vision; he was learned and venerable, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman who guided beings, unexcelled, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, a blessed one. {{page:{number:332,folio:F.167.a}}} The thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Unhindered Vision had a buddha realm consisting of a number of trichiliocosms equal to the amount of grains of sand in the Ganges River. In that buddha realm no sentient beings were born who had disturbed discipline, nor, for that matter, any beings with any afflictions. All those beings, who had in the past formed roots of virtue with perfect buddhas, now also formed roots of virtue in the presence of the thus-gone Unhindered Vision. The thus-gone Unhindered Vision was aware of all those beings’ thoughts, and so he proceeded to praise the thus-gone ones’ ten powers: ‘Everything that is excellent can be accomplished on the basis of the thus-gone ones’ ten powers. Thus, in order to realize them, you should be diligent even at the risk of harming your body, skin, organs, bones, stomach, flesh, and blood. If you forsake diligence, you will not achieve the thus-gone ones’ ten powers.’

Thus-Gone One Unhindered Vision led the way for all of them. The Thus-Gone One was able to bring all those countless sentient beings to the wisdom of buddhahood. He led them all to awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood and total nirvāṇa. What do you think, Maudgalyāyana? In case you may think that at that time King Virtuous Vision was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was King Virtuous Vision. Because of this, from that point onward, I was indefatigable in bringing sentient beings to maturity. How is this? When I was training as a bodhisattva, the more I brought beings to maturity, {{page:{number:333,folio:F.167.b}}} the more they passed beyond suffering. Maudgalyāyana, as inconceivable a number of beings as they were, I was able to lead them all to transcend suffering. One could not even count their number. Maudgalyāyana, applying myself to the preservation of the Buddha’s lineage, I led that amount of sentient beings to unexcelled and perfect awakening, and brought them to maturity.

When her parents were giving her up for marriage, she begged them: ‘Father, Mother—please don’t give me up for marriage!’
“Her parents replied, ‘Child, what is your wish?’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1089}} “She answered, ‘Father, Mother—please do not give me up for marriage! If you ask why I say this, Father, it is because the more one acquires, the more one suffers. Those who have no possessions have no suffering. Just look, Father, at how much grief comes with being a householder. With no household the grief of being a householder would be gone. With having children come the troubles of having children. Without children the troubles of having children would be gone. With attachments come the troubles of attachments; without attachments the troubles of attachments would be gone. This is how I understand attachments: they are the source of all problems. This is how I understand the householder life: I understand it as something harmful. {{page:{number:338,folio:F.170.a}}} Father, sentient beings have interest in various elements. Those who take pleasure in cyclic existence seek out attachments. Those who take no pleasure in cyclic existence do not seek out attachments. I take no pleasure in cyclic existence; thus I do not seek out attachments. Happiness occurs when one gives up all attachments.’
“What do you think, Maudgalyāyana? In case you may think that at that time Princess Innumerable was anyone else, Maudgalyāyana, do not think so. In those days I was Princess Innumerable. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, just as with me in the past, so with bodhisattvas in the present—if they have attachments, they will suffer, while they will not suffer if they have no attachments. They should understand this principle and train in having no attachments. Maudgalyāyana, when I was training in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, in order to understand the path that leads to cessation as related to knowledge of the various elements, I came to understand perfectly the knowledge of the origin as related to the various elements. Then, wondering how I could explain it to beings, I created a multitude of different roots of virtue.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1091}} “Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there appeared in the world a man named Jayasena the Swordsmith, who had mastered all the fine points of his trade. He had mastered every trade with a seal and was well familiar with all of the seals of vessels. {{note:{index:46,id:UT22084-047-001-1092}}} One day Jayasena the Swordsmith had the thought, ‘I hold the seal of every single trade. There is not even a single trade seal I do not possess.’
“At that time there appeared in the world a thus-gone one named Infinite Vision; he was learned and venerable, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman who guided beings, unexcelled, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, a blessed one. At that time there was a benevolent god, who was an old friend of Jayasena, and who had before been his relative. Once, while in midair, {{page:{number:339,folio:F.170.b}}} this god made his physical appearance vanish, and then spoke these verses:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1094}} “ ‘My friend! The perfect Buddha, foremost of humans, has appeared. He loves all beings and his name is Infinite Vision. He helps all beings and has transcended everything. He is a teacher who puts an end to questions and removes doubts.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1095}} “ ‘Go before him—the Sage, who knows everything as it is— Ask what is on your mind, and put what you hear into practice. What the Teacher says is true; he has no other kind of words. So put whatever he says into practice just as you hear it.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1096}} “Jayasena the Swordsmith heard the god’s eloquent speech. After that night had passed, he began to search everywhere, asking people where the blessed thus-gone Infinite Vision was currently dwelling. He worked hard to find the Thus-Gone One; when it was not known where the Thus-Gone One was dwelling, he would ask where he might have traveled. At that point the thus-gone Infinite Vision knew the time for Jayasena the Swordsmith’s roots of virtue was ripe, and so the Thus-Gone One manifested his form, sitting cross-legged in midair, and then spoke these verses to Jayasena the Swordsmith:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1097}} “ ‘The one you look for, the sublime Thus-Gone One, Guardian of the World, is here for you, and asks what you seek. I respond to questions and clear people’s doubts. So, quickly, ask what is on your mind.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1098}} “With a calm mind, he said, ‘I ask about a craft— Where in the world is there the slightest craft I do not know?’ Jayasena thus asked the radiant Buddha. Then the all-seeing guide and teacher replied:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1099}} “ ‘Where there is no craft and neither any craftsman, Everything is non-arisen: this is the supreme human’s craft. Learn my craft and you will soon become a craftsman! Learning every craft, you will then benefit sentient beings.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1100}} “Then, without moving from that spot, Jayasena the Swordsmith achieved acceptance that phenomena are unborn.
“Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time Jayasena the Swordsmith {{page:{number:340,folio:F.171.a}}} was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was Jayasena the Swordsmith, and trained in the unexcelled craft. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas who wish to train in understanding the path leading to cessation as related to knowledge of the various elements should train in the non-origination of everything.”
Knowledge of the World
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1101}} “Maudgalyāyana, when I was training in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, in order to understand the world, I decided to cultivate an understanding of the world with which I could teach beings in an accurate manner. With that in mind, I created a variety of different roots of virtue.
“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a root digger named Truly Discerned Concept, who had extrasensory perception of all beings’ minds. He went from town to city to village to kingdom to palace teaching his knowledge about roots. At that time there was also a mendicant named Udāyī who had cultivated all the roots of virtue. He heard that a root digger named Truly Discerned Concept was teaching his knowledge of roots to large gatherings of people. This made him think, ‘One should not teach in this way about worldly knowledge, and yet I will go and learn this sort of worldly knowledge.’ Learning the knowledge of roots, he then went to a hermitage and sat in solitude in his quarters, analyzing: ‘Where can I seek out worldly knowledge?’ The thought then came to him: ‘I need not seek worldly knowledge anywhere else than this very body.’ His contemplations continued: ‘What is this world?’ And then the thought came to him: ‘This world is the five aggregates, which arise, age, become ill, {{page:{number:341,folio:F.171.b}}} and die. In that sense they are fleeting, transient, transitory, and perishable. They are unsteady, and prone to decay and decomposition. Whoever understands the world with such knowledge will bring an end to the suffering of aging, bring an end to the suffering of sickness, and bring an end to the suffering of death.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1103}} “He then felt compassion for sentient beings, thinking, ‘None of these beings understand how the entire world consists of fleeting and transient phenomena. I will liberate all these sentient beings from the world.’ And setting himself to this, he achieved the five types of superknowledge, and amused himself with his five types of superknowledge. He then went on to teach them to others. By means of his five types of superknowledge, he could see how sentient beings rush through the five classes of beings. Feeling immense compassion for them, he proceeded to lead all beings in the buddha realm to attain the five types of superknowledge.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1104}} “Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time Udāyī the mendicant was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was Udāyī the mendicant. In that way I led all of the sentient beings throughout the buddha realm to possess the five types of superknowledge. I dedicated all those beings’ five types of superknowledge toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening. I also served all those beings by leading them to fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, thus reaching total nirvāṇa. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should understand the world to be their own fathom-tall body. They should also understand the origin of that world, the cessation of that world, and the path that leads to the cessation of that world. {{page:{number:342,folio:F.172.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1105}} “Furthermore, Maudgalyāyana, when I was training in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, I created numerous different roots of virtue in order to understand the world. I came to acquire the perfection of generosity, just as I came to possess the perfections of discipline, patience, diligence, concentration, and insight. Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past—a countlessly, inconceivably, immeasurably, incalculably, and inexpressibly long time ago—there was a captain named Kāruṇika. He was clever, bright, prudent, knowledgeable about the cardinal directions and the intermediate directions, as well as about what is true and false, astrology, daytime, moments, seconds, and instants, and he was skilled in means and knowledgeable about the lower realms. Once, feeling confident, and having carried out the ceremonies for good fortune and auspiciousness, he set off to sea with five hundred merchants on board. On the way, the captain who was acting as guide for the five hundred merchants expounded at length about the world: ‘To the east of this world there are innumerable other worlds, some of which are being formed, some of which are ceasing, some of which are disintegrating, and some of which are emerging. Still others remain in a state of post-disintegration, others remain after being formed, and others are just emerging. Friends, such worlds are innumerable . Likewise, in all these worlds throughout the ten directions there are beings of superior type and beings of inferior type. Some of them are rich, some poor. Some of them are servants, some lords. You should understand the world in numerous ways, both in terms of general knowledge and specific knowledge. My friends, in this way, you should exert yourselves in the world and in knowledge of the world.’ {{page:{number:343,folio:F.172.b}}}
“What do you think, Maudgalyāyana? In case you may think that at that time the captain Kāruṇika was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was the captain Kāruṇika. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should engage in the practices of the world and worldly behavior.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1107}} “Furthermore, Maudgalyāyana, when I was training in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, I created numerous different roots of virtue in order to understand the world. Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a prostitute named Adapting to All Beings. She was gorgeous and had a lovely figure. She was attractive, and had a fine complexion. She was fully developed and sublime. Whoever she was with, she adapted herself to their mindset. She never revealed herself nor gave herself up. In the same way, Maudgalyāyana, if you understand how all composite things truly are, you will see that they are insubstantial. Composite things are in no way fixed. If you think they are clean, they will appear to be clean. If you think they are unclean, they will appear to be unclean. The same can be said for perceiving things to be pleasurable or painful, permanent or impermanent, having characteristics or lacking characteristics—they will all appear in the corresponding manner. Maudgalyāyana, to perceive things as clean brings bondage; to recognize them as unclean brings liberation. To perceive things as pleasurable brings bondage; to recognize them as painful brings liberation. To perceive things as permanent brings bondage; to recognize them as impermanent brings liberation. To perceive that there is a self brings bondage; to recognize selflessness brings liberation. To perceive things as having characteristics brings bondage; to recognize them as lacking characteristics brings liberation. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattva great beings who seek complete nirvāṇa, {{page:{number:344,folio:F.173.a}}} and who wish to bring sentient beings to complete nirvāṇa, should forsake the characteristic of cleanliness and rely on the characteristic of uncleanliness. This can be applied to the others as well, up to forsaking characteristics and utilizing the absence of characteristics—this is the path to liberation.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1108}} “Maudgalyāyana, you may wonder how bodhisattvas should cultivate knowledge of the origin as related to knowledge of the world. Maudgalyāyana, in this regard bodhisattva great beings who wish to fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood should never give up relying on a spiritual guide. Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a bodhisattva named Truly Noble Radiance. He was well established in unsurpassed and perfect awakening, had formed roots of virtue with innumerable thus-gone ones, and possessed a variety of roots of virtue. In his dreams when he was sleeping, he never experienced anything other than being engaged with the thus-gone ones in conversation; in this way he got to know the thus-gone ones. At that time there had appeared in the world a thus-gone one named Unhindered Teacher. While he was together with the thus-gone Unhindered Teacher, they shared the following conversation. He asked, ‘Blessed One, how can one genuinely achieve understanding of the origin as related to knowledge of the world? What serves as the immediate cause of knowledge of the origin as related to knowledge of the world?’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1109}} “ ‘Noble son,” came the reply, “it is excellent that you had the thought to benefit many beings, and to ask this question of the Thus-Gone One in order to benefit many beings. Thus, noble son, listen well and keep what I am about to say in your heart.’
“ ‘Of course, Blessed One,’ he said, and he listened to the Blessed One attentively.

To internalize that knowledge, they should exert themselves in gaining realization. Bodhisattvas who are engaged in such explanations and the doctrines of past generations should learn the conventions of ordinary people, the conventions of a particular town, and the conventions of a particular region. Wherever they go, they should learn the conventions of that place. As much worldly knowledge as there is, they should master all of it.’
“What do you think, Maudgalyāyana? In case you may think that at that time the bodhisattva called Truly Noble Radiance was anyone else, do not think so. And why? Because in those days I was the bodhisattva called Truly Noble Radiance.

Dwelling among such queens with qualities like goddesses, King Viśvabhū was nonetheless free of desire and free of anything negative and unvirtuous. He was intelligent and discerning and had come to the culmination of the first level of concentration with its concomitant joy and bliss born of disengagement. Similarly, he reached the culmination of everything up to the fourth level of concentration, in which he abided. After dwelling in equanimity at the fourth level of concentration, he eventually emerged from it, and had the insight, ‘Sentient beings pine after the five sense pleasures; they are totally attached to their desires. They engage in and carry out harmful actions, due to which they fall into the lower states. Some of them create the karma for becoming hell beings, others for becoming animals, others for entering the realm of the Lord of Death, others the divine realms, and others the human realm but with short lives. Some have a longer life, others face less harm. Some end up in a low class while others end up in a noble class. Some have little charisma while others have more charisma. Some have little wealth while others have more wealth. Some are unintelligent while others are intelligent. Some exert themselves in following the current, while others exert themselves in going against the current.’ Then he had the thought, ‘These paths are in disharmony with the goal. I must guide these beings onto the path of the completely awakened ones.’

Having achieved the five types of superknowledge, he was compelled by compassion {{page:{number:354,folio:F.178.a}}} and thus went from town to town, city to city, and region to region engaged in teaching the path of the ten virtuous actions and putting an end to the path of the ten unvirtuous actions. He then led all those beings onto the path of the ten virtuous actions in that very buddha realm, and turned them away from the path of the ten unvirtuous actions. He dedicated the path of the ten virtuous actions practiced by all those beings toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Then he led everyone in that buddha realm to the irreversible stage. Having guided all beings in that buddha realm to the irreversible stage, after dying, he became Brahmā in the Brahmā Realm where he was reborn into the state of Great Brahmā. Once there, he was both subdued and not subdued. {{note:{index:47,id:UT22084-047-001-1149}}} Eventually, after dying there, at the termination of the eon he was born into the same state as the luminous gods. Born among the luminous gods, when the next eon ended, he was again reborn into the realm of Brahmā. There in the realm of Brahmā he led one quintillion beings to the level of non-regression. When that realm came to an end, he was again reborn among the luminous gods. While he dwelled there, he led countless hundreds of billions of beings to the irreversible stage, such that they dwelled where there was no one ever born who was without the Dharma. Applying these hundreds of thousands of methods, after he died in the realm of Brahmā, he migrated among the luminous gods, and from there again to the realm of Brahmā. When on occasion he would appear in the human realm, he would still possess the five types of superknowledge even though there was no buddha present. When there was a buddha present, he would serve as attendant to that blessed buddha. Accumulating such roots of virtue, the blessed buddhas then led him to enter into equanimity, in which he then remained. Whether there was pleasure or whether there was disengagement, he knew the Thus-Gone One was present. {{page:{number:355,folio:F.178.b}}}

Knowledge of Absorption
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1206}} “Maudgalyāyana, when I was training in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, I created numerous different roots of virtue in order to understand absorption. I did this by pondering how I could use the equanimity of concentration against my senses being distracted by objects. Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a former king, now a sage, named King Birth Seeker. He had given up royal affairs to ordain. Yet despite having ordained, his senses were distracted by objects. He thought to himself, ‘Oh, how sad! Having forsaken all objects and ordained, it is unfit and improper that my senses are yet distracted. With my deluded senses so caught in the cage of objects, I must apply concentration that is like space, and thereby develop the great strength to defeat all opponents. If I am to do this, though, what is the equipoise of bodhisattva great beings that is like space?’ Then King Birth Seeker reflected, ‘All these phenomena are like space. {{page:{number:370,folio:F.186.a}}} In the sense that there is nothing obstructing space, all objects are similar to space. Non-conceptuality is unobstructed; non-conceptuality is liberation. Conceptuality is a fetter, while non-conceptuality is what cuts that fetter. So I will give up conceptuality.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1207}} “He then set himself to the task of severing all attachments. Achieving the absorption that is like space, he attained acceptance that phenomena are unborn. At that point he was able to develop the power over the realm of phenomena, and so he levitated to the height of seven palm trees. There in midair, he uttered these verses:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1208}} “ ‘Whoever realizes the principle of non-obstruction Has understood the domain of all buddhas, Penetrated the domain of the past buddhas, And comprehended the doctrine of the Dharma kings.

In case you may think that at that time the sage King Birth Seeker—who achieved acceptance that phenomena are unborn without learning it from another—was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was the sage King Birth Seeker. Due to those roots of virtue, I was reborn in a buddha realm for eight hundred million years, where the notion ‘the Thus-Gone One is’ did not occur. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, those noble sons or daughters who want to fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood should train to gain understanding and realization of the profound Dharma whether buddhas appear and they meet them or not.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1218}} “Furthermore, Maudgalyāyana, I created numerous roots of virtue in order to understand the origin as related to knowledge of absorption.

Maudgalyāyana, the thus-gone Proclaimer of Fame had a twofold following of hearers. One of his assemblies of hearers consisted of a gathering of seventy-seven quintillion hearers. The second gathering consisted of one hundred sextillion hearers. All were worthy ones whose defilements were exhausted, who were free of afflictions, controlled, and who had obtained supreme perfection in mastering all mental states.

Aside from that single monk, born among the long-living gods, there were no sentient beings who had failed to produce the seeds of awakening. As the thus-gone Proclaimer of Fame was carrying out his awakened activity, he wondered, ‘Other than that single being, is there anyone else in my entire buddha realm whom I cannot benefit?’ He saw that the monk’s roots of virtue enabled him to be a worthy vessel for unsurpassed and perfect awakening, and yet he had ended up unfree. Thus he lacked the fortune to produce the roots of virtue for unsurpassed and perfect awakening. After the monk died, he descended to the Hell of Incessant Pain, where he remained for eons. There as well he did not have the fortune to form the roots of virtue needed for unsurpassed and perfect awakening. When he eventually died there, he was born as a human, though as a gesticulating, blind, and mute fool incapable of comprehending the Dharma. Then emanations of the Thus-Gone One finally brought him to maturity.

Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas who wish to please the thus-gone ones should make themselves worthy vessels. They should not sadden the Thus-Gone One, but make themselves worthy vessels. {{page:{number:373,folio:F.187.b}}} Those noble sons and daughters who abide by the Great Vehicle should make themselves worthy vessels under the safeguarding of the Thus-Gone One.

In case you may think that at that time that single bodhisattva who was not a vessel for the Dharma and who had taken rebirth among the long-living gods was anyone else, do not think so. In those days the unworthy bodhisattva was the thus-gone Amṛtaprabha. He had disparaged the Dharma and thus fell astray. What do you think, Maudgalyāyana? In case you may think that at that time the thus-gone one who brought that being to maturity was anyone else, do not think so. It was the thus-gone Sarvārthasiddhi.

“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a king named Pure Intellect. He possessed limitless roots of virtue. He had practiced the pure conduct of countless thus-gone ones while serving as their attendants on numerous occasions. {{page:{number:374,folio:F.188.a}}} Having attended to those thus-gone ones with the awakening mind of all the thus-gone ones, he eventually had the thought, ‘I should not try to please the Thus-Gone One with conceptual service. I should not serve the Thus-Gone One with a mundane materialistic attitude. Instead, since what I desire is omniscience, I should try to serve the thus-gone ones without any sense of pleasing them or displeasing them. By serving the thus-gone ones in this way, may I achieve omniscient wisdom. Forming such a resolve, just as I fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, I will also fully awaken all sentient beings to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood through the easy path of the swift superknowledges. Thus, as I carry out the training of a bodhisattva, all those beings will subsequently achieve unsurpassed and perfect awakening through the easy path of the swift superknowledges. In that field where I fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect awakening, may buddhas be plentiful; may there never be a scarcity of buddhas!’ With that in mind, I served all the thus-gone ones.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1225}} “Due to those roots of virtue, here in my excellent eon, nine hundred and ninety-six thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect buddhas have appeared.

Acting in the service of all those thus-gone ones, I achieved the supreme attainment and utmost renown. I immersed myself in intense contemplation of all the thus-gone ones’ teachings.

Bodhisattvas who seek a vast buddha realm should begin by seeing stainless wisdom and then engage in training. They should be insatiable in forming roots of virtue in order to realize omniscient wisdom.
“Maudgalyāyana, I created numerous different roots of virtue in order to understand the path leading to cessation as related to knowledge of absorption. I did this by reflecting, ‘In the pursuit of unsurpassed and perfect awakening, how might I fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect awakening, and then go on to genuinely teach beings the path that leads to cessation as related to knowledge of absorption?

Knowledge of Equilibrium

“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a religious king named Utterly Stable Conduct, who reigned over numerous regions under the single umbrella of his command. In that era there were six hundred million cities in this world, which was sixty thousand leagues across. The towns, cities, and villages being in close proximity, the domestic fowls of the cities and villages would roam freely in the other towns. There lived King Utterly Stable Conduct. There were no thieves, robbers, or barbarians, but plenty of people of good morals. {{page:{number:378,folio:F.190.a}}} There were many festivals. The world was filled with merry people, and people who cultivated the Dharma were plentiful. The word ‘evil’ was unknown anywhere, let alone actual evil behavior. The environment was beautified by groves, parks, ponds, and pools, like a divine garden. It was jubilant with the continuous, uninterrupted songs of conches, clay and wooden drums, three-stringed lutes, lutes resounding everywhere, single-stringed lutes, flutes, nakulas , beautiful voices, hand-drums, dance-cords, banduras , kettle drums, bracelets, and various lesser instruments. Like an abode of spirits or gods, it was filled with ornamental divine trees and trees of incense, garlands, and silk, and there were trees with desirable fruits. Noble beings lived there; there were no other beings but noble beings.

They were modest, decent, and possessed the modesty achieved by noble beings. They also created karma primarily with reference to the thus-gone Stainless Zenith. There the thus-gone Stainless Zenith lived and was honored. The pleasant sounds of reverence and worship reverberated, and it became widely reported how noble beings had gathered there.

He guided some of them with the vehicle of the hearers, some of them with the vehicle of the solitary buddhas, and some of them with the unsurpassed vehicle of the buddhas. When the thus-gone Stainless Zenith taught the Dharma, speech endowed with eight qualities emerged from his mouth and his voice contained the five hundred aspects of speech. Thus, as it emerged, it was understood throughout the entire buddha realm. When the thus-gone Stainless Zenith taught the Dharma, the entire buddha realm was sprinkled with perfumed water. As the Thus-Gone One was manifesting his activity, when the blessed thus-gone Stainless Zenith would teach the Dharma, the sounds of divine instruments came from the sky. Whatever the beings there wished and enjoyed to hear, they would hear as pleasing, beautiful, and jubilant utterances, which they relished. Whatever utterances they enjoyed or desired, they would hear those very sounds. If they desired the joy of nirvāṇa, they happily experienced its bliss, free of anything unwholesome. Those beings who desired the Dharma heard the words ‘impermanence,’ ‘suffering,’ ‘no-self,’ ‘peace,’ ‘nirvāṇa,’ ‘Buddha,’ ‘Dharma,’ and ‘Saṅgha.’ They heard the words ‘recollection of the Buddha,’ ‘recollection of the Dharma,’ ‘recollection of the Saṅgha,’ ‘recollection of discipline,’ ‘recollection of relinquishment,’ and ‘recollection of the deities.’ {{page:{number:380,folio:F.191.a}}} As the Thus-Gone One’s activity came to fruition, cool winds blew on those listening to the Dharma.

Concerning this, bodhisattvas should understand that escape from desirous thoughts constitutes a remedy to conceptualization. Such notions of escaping desire reverse desirous thoughts and remedy them.

Throughout the entire realm there was no punishment and no threat of weapons. Instead, everyone lived according to the law. Everyone in King Golden Banner’s kingdom, which was called Victorious , was practicing the path of the ten virtues. In the buddha realm in that era there were no hell beings, no animals, no inhabitants of the realms of the Lord of Death, and no demigods. All the beings in the buddha realm at that time were engaged in the path of the ten virtues and their life span was fixed at eighty thousand years.

I was the joyful servant of the monastic saṅgha, and always kept my mind in equilibrium. I dedicated all those roots of virtue, moreover, to manifesting the cessation of equilibrium. Due to those roots of virtue, I did actualize knowledge of cessation as related to knowledge of equilibrium.

The sages and men who recited ancient legends explained the essence of the past accomplishments of the universal monarchs. They explained the ancient legends of how accomplished universal monarchs ruled and maintained their kingdom, and what proclamations they made. The noble accomplished monarch listened carefully to the sages and reciters of ancient legends, and proceeded to rule the kingdom accordingly. He applied a loving attitude toward all beings. He proclaimed the Dharma of the kingdom and engendered the four abodes of Brahmā. He also led all beings to engender the four abodes of Brahmā and all of them were reborn in the realm of Brahmā where they cultivated the path leading to cessation as related to knowledge of equilibrium.

He was not free from desire, but had taken hold of the faculties via discernment, not through meditation. So that his faculties would not be afflicted with respect to their objects, he wandered from one remote place to another, from grove to grove, and from forest to forest. After a while he happened to see a woman. Since he had been trying to restrain his faculties but without meditating, as soon as he saw the woman, he was beset with passionate desire. As that passionate desire welled up within him, he caught himself, and then thought, ‘While I am restraining my senses by means of analysis, it is not happening via discernment born of understanding.’ {{page:{number:391,folio:F.196.b}}} He then thought, ‘I should seek the unafflicted wisdom of the noble ones, the understanding by which I can restrain my senses.’ While he was then reflecting in this way, he had the following personal insight: ‘The afflictive phenomena that arise in this way must be understood. The afflictions that arise toward women must be understood. By this type of analysis one does not apprehend afflictive phenomena, nor does one apprehend the phenomena toward which one is afflicted.’ At that moment he achieved freedom from attachment to the objects of desire.

{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1307}} “The bodhisattva called Non-Deficiency of Mind then went before the thus-gone Ambrosial King along with myriad other beings, including six hundred thousand brahmins, eight hundred forty thousand great householders of the warrior caste, and innumerable tens of thousands of brahmins. The thus-gone Ambrosial King saw the bodhisattva Non-Deficiency of Mind and the masses of other beings approaching in the distance. As he watched them, he used his miraculous powers to fill the entire buddha realm with a golden light . Then, using his miraculous abilities again, he made it so that there was no distinction or difference between gods and humans, that is to say, no one thought, ‘These are gods, while these over here are humans.’ The huge multitude of beings comprising the entourage became utterly quiet, such that there was not even the sound of a single being clearing their throat.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1308}} “When the bodhisattva Non-Deficiency of Mind noticed how calm the group had become and heard the silence, he thought, ‘Whatever sound does not arise, does not cease. Whatever has ceased is also unborn.’ He continued to reflect, ‘Thus if a sound does not arise, it does not cease. Since it is non-existent, there is no thing that really ceases. {{page:{number:403,folio:F.202.b}}} Because there is no real existence, there is also no birth.’ He then wondered, ‘What is the nature of these phenomena that arise?’ before the insight came to him: ‘These arising phenomena of existence have no real nature. They are unborn and unceasing.’ When in that moment he did not apprehend any nature of phenomena, he achieved acceptance that phenomena are unborn. Then, realizing that the bodhisattva called Non-Deficiency of Mind had achieved acceptance that phenomena are unborn, the thus-gone Ambrosial King gave his approval: ‘Wonderful! Noble son, how excellent that you have come to understand phenomena correctly.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1309}} “What do you think, Maudgalyāyana? In case you may think that at that time the bodhisattva named Non-Deficiency of Mind was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was the bodhisattva named Non-Deficiency of Mind. Due to those roots of virtue, for seventy-six incalculable eons I did not fall astray or become confused about the Dharma. I never had an unwholesome state of mind, whether born of attachment, born of anger, or born of stupidity. I constantly rested my mind within omniscience. Due to such lucidity of mind, I was able to leave behind my habitual tendencies. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should discern the cessation of phenomena; thus will habitual tendencies be overcome.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1310}} “Maudgalyāyana, when I was training in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, I created countless different roots of virtue in order to understand the path leading to cessation as related to purification. I did this by wondering, ‘How can I fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, and then teach beings correctly?’
“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a spiritually inclined Dharma king named Immaculate Consecration. {{page:{number:404,folio:F.203.a}}} He held the seven treasures, and so forth. He investigated and inquired, along with his two ministers and other experts, as to where in the world the secluded hermitages of the ascetics and brahmins were.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1312}} “At the same time, in the vicinity of King Immaculate Consecration was a thus-gone one named Vimalanetra; he was learned and venerable, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman who guided beings, unexcelled, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, a blessed one. He was a Dharma teacher whose instructions were good in the past, good in the middle, good in the end, of excellent meaning, and with excellent words—unmixed, complete, pure, and chaste. King Immaculate Consecration heard that the thus-gone Vimalanetra was teaching the Dharma in his area, and that in the Thus-Gone One’s retinue was a saṅgha of innumerable monks. When he heard this news, he thought, ‘The Thus-Gone One is wise, as he surely possesses extraordinary wisdom. Since someone with a retinue as big as his must be in harmony with the Dharma, no one will be able to repudiate him. I will go before the thus-gone Vimalanetra, and ask him about knowledge of gathering as related to knowledge of purification.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1313}} “With that in mind, he went before the thus-gone Vimalanetra along with eight hundred thousand other beings, one thousand ministers, and eight hundred thousand wives. At that time the Thus-Gone One was teaching the Dharma, while surrounded by countless tens of thousands of beings. The audience was silent and listening attentively with their ears perked, with all sentient beings in mind. Not even the sound of someone clearing their throat arose among anyone in the crowd. Due to having gathered roots of virtue in the past, the king was able to remain in equilibrium up to the fourth concentration while surrounded by his eight hundred thousand women. {{page:{number:405,folio:F.203.b}}} Merely beholding the Thus-Gone One, he noticed how his senses and demeanor were calm, and thus felt unfathomable appreciation for the Thus-Gone One. He then reflected, ‘With such a large following, it is impossible that someone could repudiate the Thus-Gone One. Why not? Because his following is so large. The Thus-Gone One’s demeanor is so calm. No one else has a demeanor like his. It is extraordinary! Without a doubt the Thus-Gone One possesses extraordinary wisdom.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1314}} “He then approached the Thus-Gone One along with his entourage and retinue of queens. The thus-gone Vimalanetra greeted him from a distance, saying, ‘Your Highness, come nearer; be welcome, Your Highness! Your Highness, you have labored a long time to see the Thus-Gone One. Your Highness, it is not in vain that you have come to see the Thus-Gone One. Your Highness, you will leave with your reward. Receiving the Thus-Gone One’s reply to your question, your purpose will be fulfilled.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1315}} “King Immaculate Consecration and his entourage then bowed their heads at the Thus-Gone One’s feet, before then sitting off to one side. At that point, eight hundred million gods from the Brahmā Realm manifested in the sky above the Thus-Gone One, all of them with their palms together. They were invisible even to the gods of the desire realm, no need to mention humans. However, by the miraculous power of the thus-gone Vimalanetra, the entire retinue of humans, gods of the desire realm, and gods of the Brahmā Realm became visible to King Immaculate Consecration. Witnessing all that, he thought, ‘No one can repudiate the thus-gone Vimalanetra. {{page:{number:406,folio:F.204.a}}} It is impossible ! Not even all these gods of the desire realm that are here with their palms together, or the gods of the Brahmā Realm that are here in midair with their palms together could repudiate him, so forget about someone human.’ He then stood up from his seat, knelt on his right knee, and, bowing toward the Thus-Gone One with his palms together, praised the blessed thus-gone Vimalanetra with these verses:
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1316}} “ ‘With great wisdom you have gone beyond all phenomena—homage to you! The entire world, including the gods, is here before you with palms joined. Gods, humans, gandharvas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas— All are here, gazing upon the Buddha with joined palms.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1317}} “ ‘They are here because the Blessed One possesses all-seeing wisdom. That is why the whole world, including the gods, now join their palms in homage.

{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1321}} The thus-gone Vimalanetra listened to King Immaculate Consecration’s {{note:{index:57,id:UT22084-047-001-1322}}} words of insight for the benefit and happiness of all beings. With his flawless voice and liberated eloquence {{page:{number:407,folio:F.204.b}}} he then spoke the following verses in reply:
“ ‘Excellent that you ask this to benefit the whole world, excellent! Listen, for I shall explain this to you accurately. Like a blazing fire, wisdom burns away the afflictions. When understood, absorbed, and practiced in this way,
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1324}} “ ‘There is no attachment to the knowledge that liberates from afflictions.

Due to the ensuing roots of virtue he avoided unfortunate rebirths for ninety-six innumerable eons, and he was never born into the lower classes. His teeth never rotted and his eyes were never yellow, fearful, or deluded. He was always radiant and endowed with mindfulness, knowledge, and miraculous powers . Cared for by the buddhas, he would be born into buddha realms, and there always recognize the buddha present. In this way he trained innumerable trillions of beings in cyclic existence by means of the three vehicles of hearers, solitary buddhas, and unsurpassed buddhas.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1333}} “Maudgalyāyana, in case you may have any doubts or hesitations so as to think that at that time King Immaculate Consecration was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was King Immaculate Consecration. As I engaged in the practice of a bodhisattva, I prayed that the beings of the buddha realms into which I am born will always become aware of the presence of the Buddha. Keeping that wish, I engaged in the practice of a bodhisattva. Since that mindset was free of any ill will, I was able to train, by remaining attached to that, innumerably many tens of thousands of beings. Maudgalyāyana, it is in that way that bodhisattva great beings {{page:{number:409,folio:F.205.b}}} should complete and perfect their aspirations.”
Knowledge of Abiding
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1334}} “Maudgalyāyana, when I was training in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, I created unfathomably numerous roots of virtue in order to understand abiding. I did this by wondering, ‘How can I fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood and then teach beings about the knowledge of abiding?’
“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past, there appeared in the world a thus-gone one named King of Banyan Trees; he was learned and venerable, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a steersman who guided beings, unexcelled, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, a blessed one. The buddha realm of the thus-gone King of Banyan Trees consisted of ninety-six ineffable worlds. Throughout the vast cities of that buddha realm there were no realms of hell, no animals, nor any realms of the Lord of Death. Sentient beings there were not of different complexion, but all were alike, sharing the same golden color. The shapes of the beings there were not different either, as all grew to the size of a banyan tree. Neither did their possessions differ, because all property was shared, and the beings of that realm did not have different lifespans. Everyone’s life was equally long, lasting for eighty trillion years. No one died from anything but natural causes and no one would die with fear. Everyone would pass away in special circumstances.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1336}} “Blessed One,” inquired venerable Maudgalyāyana, “if beings there were not different from each other, how could their deaths be special?” {{page:{number:410,folio:F.206.a}}}
The Blessed One replied, “Well said, Maudgalyāyana, excellent. Generally, there is no apparent existence with respect to phenomena. Therefore, with respect to phenomena there is also no apparent existence for hearers or solitary buddhas. Even the existence of bodhisattvas who have aroused the mind of awakening for the first time and thus brought forth the initial mind of awakening is also not apparent, so why even mention the hearers? Maudgalyāyana, this does not even pertain to the level of those bodhisattvas who abide on the level of a regent. Nevertheless, Maudgalyāyana, they appear due to the power of such bodhisattvas’ roots of virtue. Maudgalyāyana, in this realm, however, beings did not progress by means of any roots of virtue. Still, the minds of those bodhisattvas would constantly develop, without ever waning, throughout day and night. It is in this sense that they were special.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1337}} “At that time in the realm of the thus-gone King of Banyan Trees there lived a bodhisattva named Beyond Doubt who ruled a kingdom. In the retinue of King Beyond Doubt there were eight million women, and he had one thousand ministers. Once, during the summer, the king went, without great craving, to a cool and peaceful park full of flowering trees, together with eight hundred thousand of the ladies. There King Beyond Doubt made the following prayer: ‘May all beings who are near me and experience poverty avail themselves of my treasury and find wealth.’ And with this thought in mind he ruled his kingdom.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1338}} “King Beyond Doubt did not have any notions of flawed discipline, nor did he entertain ideas about the observation of discipline. {{page:{number:411,folio:F.206.b}}} He did not have any thoughts about being mindful, and neither did he remain ensnared by the mind of desire, the mind of anger, or the mind of stupidity. Thus, with a completely pure mind , he never separated from the mind of awakening. Whether coming, going, staying, sitting, lying down, or asleep, he was free of any conceit. Needless to mention that he did not become careless either. Instead he continuously entered the mind of awakening. He had love for suffering beings, compassion for afflicted beings, delight at witnessing happy beings, and equanimity with respect to those who had completed their tasks. As he lay down to sleep at night, he gave rise to the mind of awakening, wishing, ‘I must find out where in the world to find a person worthy of offerings who will develop my roots of virtue and be my spiritual teacher. How can I rest in the first concentration, and how can I emerge from it? Likewise, how can I enter and emerge from all the concentrations up to and including the fourth? Likewise, how can I rest in the knowledge of abiding in the states of love, compassion, joy, and equanimity? How can I emerge within the knowledge of abiding? How can I rest in the knowledge of abiding as related to knowledge of the origin , knowledge of cessation, and knowledge of the path that leads to cessation, and how can I emerge from the knowledge of abiding as related to knowledge of the origin , knowledge of cessation, and knowledge of the path that leads to cessation? How can I rest in the knowledge of abiding, the origin , cessation, and the path, as well as the knowledge of omniscience, and how can I emerge from them?

“Thus, without any second thoughts about his kingdom and possessions, King Beyond Doubt left behind his city and traveled to see the thus-gone King of Banyan Trees. Possessing the stainless buddha eye, the thus-gone King of Banyan Trees saw that King Beyond Doubt was leaving his city. He then emanated a wish-fulfilling cotton fabric, suspended above the entire path traveled by the king. Along the way he created lakes, pools, and ponds, and he made the road as even as the palm of a hand.

Seeing all these gifts of provisions for his journey, the king said to his ministers, ‘Village chiefs, how is it possible that divine beings, whose bodies are vastly superior to those of humans, are in this way worshiping me?

“ ‘Venerable ones,’ replied the bodhisattvas, ‘we understand the teaching of the Blessed One to be telling us to examine what “done” means. And if you do that, you will not be thinking, “I have done many things.” Venerable ones, once in the past there was a sage by the name of Red Horse. This sage set out on a journey thinking, “I shall travel to the end of the world before I die.” When the sage walked, he stepped from one Sumeru mountaintop to another, traveling with great speed, as when one travels miraculously through mental powers . Yet still he died before reaching the end of the world. Venerable ones, the Blessed Buddha does not tell us to reach the end of the world on foot. Rather, it is due to wisdom that one reaches the end of the world. Venerable ones, if you stay concerned about suffering then you will also be conceiving of suffering in the future.

I upheld the three types of teaching of all those thus-gone ones as they gained perfect awakening, remained, and finally passed beyond suffering.

Still others remain in a state of post-disintegration, and others remain after being formed. Friends, such worlds are innumerable . Likewise, in all these worlds throughout the ten directions, there are beings of superior type and beings of inferior type. Some of them are rich, some poor. Some of them are servants, some lords. Thus you should understand the world in numerous ways, both in terms of general knowledge and specific knowledge.

When asleep, in his dreams the bodhisattva would have actual conversations with thus-gone ones. Thus, while nobody else could see it, he would accompany the thus-gone ones and ask them questions. At that time there was in the world a thus-gone one known as Unhindered Teacher. Once when in the company of that thus-gone one the bodhisattva Noble Light asked him, ‘Blessed One, how may one gain knowledge of the origin as related to knowledge of the world?

{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1433}} “Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past, there was a captain named Loving All Beings who had abundant possessions. This captain went to sea with a group of five hundred merchants, yet when their ship was in the middle of the ocean it was attacked by a sea monster. As the monster held the ship in its jaws the merchants paid homage and cried out to whichever gods they had faith and belief in. Thus they called out to Śiva, Skanda, Maheśvara, Indra, Varuṇa , Prajāpati, Brahmā, Kṣemaṅkara , Sūrya, or Candra. Some even paid homage to the ocean itself, and some again sat speechless, thinking, ‘We have no protector of that sort—let us just die!’ Regardless, nobody came to anyone’s rescue.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1434}} “The captain Loving All Beings thought to himself, ‘Alas, all these merchants have relied on an inferior source of refuge. They have put their hopes in a being who is neither a protector nor a refuge. In their mistaken devotion they perceive that things have essences. Yet were I to teach, I would not teach any essences to anyone.’
“Thus, Maudgalyāyana, when conditioned things are understood correctly, as they are, one does not perceive any entities. There is no certainty with respect to formations. If one wishes for purity one must give up the marks of purity and instead rely on the marks of impurity. Similarly, one must give up marks and rely on the absence of marks; that is the path of liberation. Maudgalyāyana, for the sake of knowledge with an interest in several elements I teach that permanence is bondage, and impermanence is liberation; self is bondage, and absence of self is liberation; and marks {{page:{number:429,folio:F.215.b}}} are bondage, and absence of marks is liberation.

Yet if one conceives of impurity one will display an impure appearance. If one thinks in terms of happiness, suffering, permanence, impermanence, self, absence of self, marks, or absence of marks, one will display an appearance of the absence of marks. {{note:{index:65,id:UT22084-047-001-1437}}} Maudgalyāyana, conceiving of purity is bondage, thinking of impurity is liberation. Conceiving of happiness is bondage, thinking of suffering is liberation. It is in this way that affliction occurs.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1438}} “The captain Loving All Beings wanted to free his companions from their distress. At that time a thus-gone one known as Conqueror of All Darkness had appeared in the world.

“Stricken by terror in the face of death, the merchants became entirely focused and cried, ‘Homage to the thus-gone Conqueror of All Darkness!’ {{page:{number:430,folio:F.216.a}}} As soon as the sea monster heard the name of the Buddha it was pleased, and so it closed its mouth and let all the merchants escape from their agony.
“Maudgalyāyana, what do you think? In case you may think that, at that time, the captain Loving All Beings was anyone else, do not think so. And why not? Because in those days I was the captain Loving All Beings.

Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past, there appeared in the world a thus-gone one named Friend of Beings. Within the buddha realm of the thus-gone Friend of Beings was a bodhisattva known as Nityodyukta. Rousing diligence, this bodhisattva’s mind was undaunted, he had donned the great armor, and had pure aspirations for innumerable buddha realms. He had pure aspirations for inconceivable, incomparable, immeasurable, and inexpressible buddha realms. This bodhisattva asked himself, ‘What are the causes and conditions for knowing the distinct and numerous inclinations of sentient beings? What are the various inclinations of sentient beings?’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1443}} “He then thought, ‘Sentient beings are concerned about, and take delight in, whichever objects they rely on the most. Those are the objects they are fond of and pursue. They concentrate on those objects to the extent that they will be adverse to others. However, if that object disappears from their experience, they instead become accustomed to another, which will {{page:{number:431,folio:F.216.b}}} then replace the former object as their object of concern. And so the process continues, as the inclinations shift from one type of object to another. Sentient beings will thus pursue whichever object they currently find rewarding and they will be hostile toward whichever object they deem flawed. One should therefore not become obsessed with the qualities of any object, nor should one develop aggression toward any object one may hold to be flawed. Instead, one should discern the objects and then remain neutral.’ In this way the bodhisattva Nityodyukta would neither crave for desirable objects nor be averse to faulty ones. Instead he would discern objects and remain neutral. In doing so, his achievement of the qualities of the bodhisattvas became irreversible.
“Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time the bodhisattva Nityodyukta was anyone else, do not think so. Because in those days the thus-gone Dīpaṃkara was the bodhisattva Nityodyukta.

In order to show the flaws of being attached to several inclinations he taught the knowledge of cessation as related to knowledge of several inclinations. Thus, he would explain, ‘All the inclinations, the qualities of cessation, and your own inclinations should not become the cause of obsession, because all of these inclinations are deceptive. {{page:{number:432,folio:F.217.a}}} Your inclinations are one thing and the essence of the Dharma another. So let go of your inclinations.’ Through such teaching many thousands of beings were freed from suffering.

Likewise, when I was inclined toward sounds, I would present all sorts of musical offerings to the memorials of the thus-gone ones, and still that was not enough for me. When I was inclined toward scents, I would produce abundant fragrances, and still that was not enough for me. When I was inclined toward taste, I would produce many different grains and a wide variety of dishes, and still that was not enough for me. When I was inclined toward texture, I would receive a wide array of soft garments, and still that was not enough for me. Maudgalyāyana, when I was inclined toward mental phenomena, I trained in various forms of knowledge, and still that was not enough for me.

As he in this manner served the Blessed One, he accomplished the five superknowledges and became skilled in knowing the minds of others. The blessed thus-gone Noble Peace knew his state of mind and so, whenever the thus-gone went off into solitude the bodhisattva would follow the Blessed One without considering his own objectives. And as the thus-gone Noble Peace knew the bodhisattva’s thoughts, he would act likewise. Whenever Vasuṁdhara would go somewhere the Thus-Gone One would be present there, and the bodhisattva Vasuṁdhara would in the same way also follow the thus-gone Noble Peace. Such was the way in which the Thus-Gone One trained the bodhisattva in the activities of the buddhas. In this way the bodhisattva was introduced to the Thus-Gone One’s knowledge of diverse elements.

When previously that thus-gone one had pursued the activities of a bodhisattva he did not ripen any beings by means of the vehicles of the hearers or solitary buddhas. Instead, he made all sentient beings embrace the mind of awakening. This unsurpassed and perfect buddha established the beings of his buddha realm within unsurpassed and perfect awakening and this Thus-Gone One taught them the Dharma based on the six perfections. The Thus-Gone Skilled in Releasing into Awakening brought an infinite number of beings to the irreversible stage, and having remained for innumerable eons he then passed beyond suffering within the field of nirvāṇa free from any remainder of the aggregates.

Because before, when that thus-gone was training in the practices of a bodhisattva, he would guide all beings toward upholding the Bodhisattva Vehicle, and thus all beings came to abide within that vehicle. Hence, that Thus-Gone One taught the Bodhisattva Vehicle to sentient beings, and those who received his teaching would attain deliverance within that vehicle.

Meanwhile the bodhisattva assumed the form of Vegadharin himself and thus he entered the realm of the māras and took up residence there. While in the land of the māras, he made nine hundred ninety thousand divine maidens embrace awakening. Speaking to them about the nature of the bodhisattva, he caused all these thousands of divine maidens to become irreversible from unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. Having guided all these divine maidens to the irreversible stage, he then, within the very realm of the māras, created a display for frolicking in the pleasures of the five senses. As the māra Vegadharin, who still had the dog corpse tied to him, returned to his homeland he saw gods and goddesses engaged together in playful enjoyments.

“The bodhisattva Bold Strength now produced another miraculous feat, and thus created a second māra realm above that of Vegadharin’s, yet vastly superior in terms of miraculous displays, splendor, power, and glory.

I therefore gave away innumerable elephant mounts, horses, chariots, and infantrymen. Thus, in order to accomplish the accumulations for the middle path, I produced unfathomable roots of virtue. If they had form, those roots of virtue could not even be contained within as many universes as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges.

During his reign the world underwent great developments, and so on each continent eight hundred million new cities sprang up. Each of the cities was square, measuring ten leagues on each side. They were of an artful checker design, and the buildings were plated with gold. The cities were encircled by ramparts of various precious stones, and the fences were made of gold from the Jāmbū River. Above hung nets of invaluable jewels, the ground was studded with priceless jewels, and the cities were adorned with nets of small bells that were made of the seven precious substances.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1528}} “These cities were the abode of beings who had gathered unfathomable roots of virtue. The cities were beautified by trees of the seven precious substances and full of enjoyments, both outside and within. Whenever the inhabitants wished to play, they would do so accompanied by the natural sound of the five types of instruments. Likewise, whenever the music of sitars, flutes, and cymbals would be appropriate, {{page:{number:452,folio:F.227.a}}} such music would come about naturally. Whenever people wished to enjoy the music of gandharvas, such music could be heard. Whatever the people wished to enjoy, such entertainment would indeed manifest, and remain for as long as they desired. Whether for one year, a thousand years, or ten thousand years, people could frolic for as long as they wished. Such were the riches of those cities, each one of them a center of entertainment.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1529}} “At that time there had appeared a thus-gone one known as Amṛtaprabha, whose retinue included eight hundred thousand hearers. King Joyful Sight adorned his entire world of four continents with silk tassels and ornaments, and so he offered it, along with the people of that time, for the use of the blessed thus-gone Amṛtaprabha and his saṅgha of hearers. The king also offered his children, spouse, and retinue. Thus that blessed one and his saṅgha of eight hundred thousand hearers took up residence in innumerable dwellings, and for eight million years King Joyful Sight offered them the most delicious meals. His queen and retinue also made similar offerings.

Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas must have faith in the buddhas and in the saṅgha of monks. Having attained faith, one will gain pleasurable enjoyments throughout innumerable and boundless eons, and also accomplish awakening.”

An expert in all the treatises, he observed the thoughts of sentient beings, and he was in pursuit of knowledge of the faculty of insight, both as a power and a non-power. To obtain knowledge of the power and non-power of the faculty of insight, he made offerings to those in possession of special cognition. Thus, for this purpose, the king practiced generosity continuously throughout day and night for eighty thousand years while also making inquiries among mendicants and brahmins.

He gathered those mendicants and brahmins who sincerely practiced recitation.

Thus, with respect to all knowledge, he would know what is a power and a non-power. He would be aware of when actions cease subsequent to the functioning of knowledge, or when they cease without the functioning of knowledge. He would know how they cease with a slight action, or with no action. He would know how a person becomes a vessel of knowledge, or how a person becomes capable of pacifying the afflictions.

He protected the minds of others, refrained from harsh words, followed the rules, and recollected the sages of the past. He possessed these and infinitely many other special qualities.
“Among his special cognitive abilities were miraculous skills, as well as the divine ear; knowledge of the minds of others; knowledge of past abodes; knowledge of the death, transference, and rebirth of sentient beings; knowledge of the arts and sciences; knowledge of administration; knowledge of Dharma; knowledge of time; knowledge of duration; knowledge of self; knowledge of means; and innumerably many other types of special cognition.

Whenever he came across extremists he would not take any offerings from any of them, outcastes included, once they had understood who he was. Thus his way of maintaining a beggar’s livelihood without taking any alms became well known throughout the world’s ten directions.
“At that time there was in the southern snowy mountains a sage known as Sarvavit, who had attained the five superknowledges. Throughout day and night he remained in his retreat, dwelling in the absorption known as thinking of the entire world .

This king would make declarations about all things, determining them to be in exactly one way, and not any other. The king had a wise minister called Dharmacārin, who was an expert in the ways of analysis and who sustained the kingdom. This minister had served boundless thus-gone ones, created boundless roots of virtue, and was firmly established within the Great Vehicle.

There was one jar for sesame oil, another for butter, another again for sugar, and one jar for drink, and one for food. He also had similar jars made out of different precious substances. Presenting the precious jars to the king, the minister asked, ‘Your Majesty, to what foods do these jars belong?’ {{page:{number:467,folio:F.234.b}}}
“ ‘Chief of the city,’ replied the king, ‘let me tell you what kinds of jars these are. Here is a water jug, and that one is for sesame oil. This one is a butter jar, and that one is for honey. This jar is for food and that one for drink. These are golden jars and those are of silver.’ Thus the king identified all the jars.

He poured drink into the honey jar and honey into the jar for drinking. In that way he changed all the jars around. He then invited the king for lunch, and when the king had arrived he told the servants, ‘Friends, bring us some water from the washbasin. We wish to wash our hands, so please bring a bit of water.’ The servants did as instructed and so they offered a jar full of water. When King Determiner of Things now saw all the full vessels, he exclaimed to his minister, ‘Chief of the city, have all these jars not gone to waste? The water jar is full of butter. Likewise, do not all illusory things in this way go to waste?’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1605}} “ ‘All things come to an end,’ replied the minister, ‘just as these jars have all lost their previous features. There is no certainty about anything. All entities undergo destruction. All things change. Characterized by impermanence, all things are subject to destruction. Characterized by change, they turn into something else. No thing lasts and nothing is certain about anything. We see things differently and things change. Therefore, great king, train yourself in recognizing the impermanence of all impermanent things. Train yourself in recognizing how all these uncertain things are in movement. Moreover, Your Majesty, {{page:{number:468,folio:F.235.a}}} youth becomes old age. The youth grows up, the grownup ages, and the old person succumbs. Hence, no thing is certain.’

To those involved in conceptuality he would teach the inhalation and exhalation of the breath as well as impermanence. To those involved in marks he would teach absence of marks and impermanence.

{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1655}} “The king thought to himself, ‘What type of science might one learn to become free from birth, destruction, death, and unhappiness? Might there be some form of science that is devoid of unhappiness?’ Yet when inquiring in this way he failed to find any such science that is beyond arising, destruction, death, and birth. ‘These actions are like a potter’s jars,’ he thought. ‘They contain no sentient being, and they will end. If beings do not engage in karmic formation there will neither be death nor birth.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1656}} “At that point the king attained mental absorption, and as his mind thus rested in equipoise, he thought of the distinct bodies of sentient beings. Considering the individual identities of as many beings as there are particles in a buddha realm, he determined the causes and conditions that create those identities, as well as the ways of apprehension whereby such identities emerge. Then he thought, ‘How can one acquire a cognition that does not create a personal identity? Only by disengaging from karmic formation. Whenever there is no such formation, there will not be any such distinctions. But when there is such causal formation, there obviously will be. {{page:{number:483,folio:F.242.b}}} All of that is due to ignorance and craving, and craving causes karmic activity. Yet beings are not aware of this. If craving ceases there will not be any karmic activity. Yet beings do not understand this either. Thus the wise must let the light of wisdom unfold. The bodhisattva who spreads the light of wisdom will reach the irreversible stage.’

In those days I was King Knower of Existence. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas must gain knowledge. The bodhisattva who achieves knowledge of entities reaches the irreversible stage.”
Knowledge of the Future
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1658}} “Maudgalyāyana, when I was training in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, I created boundless roots of virtue in order to understand the future. I did this by wondering how I could fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood and then teach sentient beings about the knowledge of the future.
“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a leader known as Honest Intelligence, who was expert in settling the arguments of sentient beings. As soon as he had heard people’s ideas he would immediately know whether or not they would win in a given dispute. The physical and mental conduct of Honest Intelligence was absolutely beautiful, and so when people came to see him they could not take their eyes off him again.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1660}} “To accomplish what is meaningful the leader Honest Intelligence decided to leave, enter solitude, and practice meditation. Once he had achieved mental absorption, he accomplished the divine eye due to this mental equipoise. With this eye he then perceived sentient beings’ deaths and births {{page:{number:484,folio:F.243.a}}} as well as their pleasant and unfortunate states. Seeing this, he asked himself, ‘What is it that proceeds from this world to the next?’ Yet he could not find anything that transferred from one world to another, and so he thought, ‘In essence these phenomena are like the moon’s reflection in water. It looks as if the moon has gone into the water and the disk of the moon is also visible there. All these phenomena are like that—although there is no thing that transfers, it may appear as if something has transferred to the next world. However, the karmic action that is transferred from one world to another does not dissipate.’
“The leader Honest Intelligence then guided sentient beings to this understanding of phenomena being like the moon’s reflection, and he established them within that. Thus, realizing how phenomena are like the moon reflected in water, they came to abide within the qualities of irreversibility.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1662}} “Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time the leader Honest Intelligence was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was the leader Honest Intelligence. Thus I guided innumerably many tens of thousands of beings to the irreversible stage. Those bodhisattvas then all purified buddha realms, benefiting boundlessly many beings and establishing them at the irreversible stage. They then passed beyond suffering within the field of nirvāṇa free from any remainder of the aggregates.
“Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas should consider all phenomena to be, in essence, like the moon reflected in water. A bodhisattva who regards all phenomena to be in essence like the moon reflected in water will quickly reach the level of irreversibility.

“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a king and sage known as Excellent God. {{page:{number:485,folio:F.243.b}}} He possessed tremendous miraculous powers and splendor and had attained freedom from attachment to pleasures by means of the outer path.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1666}} “This king and sage, Excellent God, went into solitude. Practicing meditation in his retreat, he wondered, ‘I see sentient beings who die and are born, taking unfortunate or happy paths, going to the higher or the lower realms. What might be the causes and conditions for that? Why does it appear that they take rebirth again after their body in a given life has died? Some are born in hells, some among the animals, and some in the realms of the Lord of Death, and some are born in the realms of demigods. Some are born as brahmins, some as royalty, some as merchants, and some as commoners. Some are born as gods in the realms of the four great kings, some as powerful gods, and some live as king of the gods. Some take birth in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, some in the Heaven Free from Strife, some in the Heaven of Joy, some in the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, and some in the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations. Some leave the human realm to be born as Brahmā. Some are born in the Realm of Brahmā, the Heaven of the High Priests of Brahmā, or the Heaven of the Retinue of Brahmā, and some are born in the Heaven of Great Brahmā. Others are born in the Heaven of Light, the Heaven of Limited Light, the Heaven of Limitless Light, the Luminous Heaven, and so forth, up to the Heaven of Perfected Virtue. Some are born in the Greater Heaven, the Heaven of Lesser Greatness, the Heaven of Limitless Greatness, and the Heaven of Great Fruition. Some are born among the beings who do not have any notions. Some are born in the Unlofty Heaven, the Heaven of No Hardship, and so forth, up to the gods of the Highest Heaven. Still others are born as gods in the fields of infinite space, infinite consciousness, and neither notion nor no notion.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1667}} “Having inquired in this way Excellent God then thought, ‘The causes and conditions are nothing other than specific afflictions, specific actions, and specific forms of birth. When the causal afflictions are present there will be causal actions, and those will bring birth. However, if one is not afflicted there will not be any formations, and without formations there will not be birth. What could be more serene, {{page:{number:486,folio:F.244.a}}} what could be more sublime, than this!’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1668}} “With this understanding Excellent God entered equipoise within the cessation of sensations related to notions. Going beyond all the fields of neither notion nor no notion, he entered equipoise within the cessation of sensations related to notions. As he emerged from his absorption, Excellent God was deeply relieved and he thought, ‘It is indeed possible to break free from this suffering!’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1669}} “Thereafter, seated in the midst of many beings, Excellent God taught the way to enter equipoise within the cessation of sensations related to notions. ‘Friends,’ he explained, ‘once you comprehend this form of absorption your attainment of the bodhisattva’s qualities will become irreversible, and you will realize what you have not yet realized.’ At that point the fourfold retinue became irreversible from unsurpassed and perfect awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1670}} “Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time the king and sage Excellent God was anyone else, do not, because I was him. Thus, as I introduced my fourfold retinue to the equipoise of the cessation of sensations as related to notions, they reached the irreversible stage.
“Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, when practicing bodhisattva activities, bodhisattvas must consider how to go beyond formation. A bodhisattva who considers how to go beyond formation will, just by bringing forth the mind of awakening a single time, be able to purify karmic obscurations, even if they are as gigantic as Mount Sumeru. All such obscurations will be destroyed, dispersed, and annihilated.

“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a great brahmin and sage known as Divine Master. He possessed tremendous miraculous powers and splendor and had attained freedom from attachment to pleasures by means of the outer path.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1674}} “Resting in the first concentration he achieved the five superknowledges, and so he thought to himself, {{page:{number:487,folio:F.244.b}}} ‘By dwelling in the first concentration one becomes capable of achieving deliverance beyond all karmic formation. This first concentration should be experienced, but it also has shortcomings, and there is deliverance beyond it. By recognizing experience, shortcomings, and deliverance in this context, one may attain deliverance beyond all karmic formation. The perfect deliverance that is based exclusively on the teaching of the blessed buddhas always concerns experience, shortcomings, and deliverance. Thus, there is experience, shortcomings, and deliverance related to the sense source of the eye up to the sense source of the mind, just as there is experience, shortcomings, and deliverance up to and including the sense sources of smell, taste, tactility, and mental phenomena. Therefore, bodhisattvas must be aware that there is experience, shortcomings, and deliverance with regard to any phenomenon.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1675}} “By correctly keeping this in mind the sage gained acceptance that phenomena are unborn. When he arose from his absorption he went on to visit villages, towns, cities, and royal palaces, thus teaching the beings there the Dharma of acceptance that phenomena are unborn. In this way he established innumerably many tens of thousands of beings in the acceptance that phenomena are unborn.

In those days I was that brahmin and sage Divine Master, and in this way I established innumerably many tens of thousands of beings in the acceptance that phenomena are unborn.

He was endowed with tremendous miraculous powers and splendor, and he had attained the five superknowledges. The sage went into solitude, and while thus practicing meditation he thought, ‘These phenomena do not lend themselves to concepts of class and family. In reality there is nothing to conceive of as phenomena or non-phenomena. Phenomena should also not be considered in terms of good or bad qualities. So-called phenomena are just whatever focal points one may hold. What are good qualities? What are bad qualities? Regret on the verge of death is not a good quality. A mind at ease at the time of death is a good quality. Thus, acts that should be performed are those that a wise being would engage in. The one who practices with ease of mind will know no fears or dreads.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1679}} “The sage then arose from his absorption. Journeying throughout the ten directions, he would declare to sentient beings, “The wise are not frightened or intimidated by phenomena that do not arise. Yet childish, ordinary beings who have not received teaching ought to be afraid. Why is that? No essence of any phenomenon at all can be observed. That which has an essence and that which has no essence are both beyond arising and ceasing. The one who can commit to this and assert it unequivocally is said to have gained “acceptance that phenomena are unborn.” You people, do not be frightened or afraid. Do not engage with and do not pursue the domain of the māras. Whenever something uunreal is claimed to be real, then that is the domain of the māras. Through this teaching of mine innumerable tens of thousands of beings have attained acceptance that phenomena are unborn and become irreversible from unsurpassed and perfect awakening.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1680}} “Maudgalyāyana, {{page:{number:489,folio:F.245.b}}} in case you may think that at that time the sage Delightful Outcaste was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was that sage Delightful Outcaste and so I established innumerable tens of thousands of beings in the acceptance that phenomena are unborn. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattva great beings must teach the Dharma for the sake of the acceptance that phenomena are unborn and they must induce that understanding in numerous gatherings of beings.”
Knowledge of Death
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1681}} “Maudgalyāyana, when I was training in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, I created numerous different roots of virtue in order to understand death. I did this by wondering how I could fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood and then teach sentient beings about the knowledge of death.
“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a king and sage known as Sāgaramati. He possessed tremendous miraculous powers and splendor and had attained freedom from attachment to pleasures by means of the outer path. Full of love for the world, Sāgaramati thought to himself, ‘Why should I remain in the forest for no reason? I shall divide the forest in terms of three causes. Thus, one part of the forest shall be for those who suffer from wind diseases, another shall be for those suffering from phlegm ailments, and a third part of the forest shall be allocated for those afflicted by bile disorders.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1683}} “Further, the sage then thought, ‘I shall travel through all parts of the forest to determine the different tastes of the trees. Some trees may be sour, others salty, still others sweet, and some may be bitter, hot, or astringent. Which are the relevant parts of the forest? What tastes do the trees hold?’
“At that time the gods of the forest came before him with joined palms. Bowing their heads to the sage’s feet, they each conveyed their tastes to him. Thus, they explained to the sage {{page:{number:490,folio:F.246.a}}} where in the forest the trees held tastes that were sour, salty, bitter, hot, astringent, or sweet.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1685}} “Sāgaramati thought to himself, ‘The different parts of the forest have accurately revealed their tastes to me. Now, how many disorders afflict sentient beings? There are four types of disorder that afflict sentient beings: wind diseases, bile diseases, phlegm diseases, and their combinations. These four may further be included in the three kinds of illness associated with wind, bile, and phlegm. The combinations are those of wind, bile, and phlegm.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1686}} “Sāgaramati then determined which parts of the forest were sour and bitter, sour and astringent, sour and hot, sour and salty, sour and sweet, salty and astringent, and so forth, through to bitter and sour. In this way he also distinguished the different parts of the forest in terms of bitter, salty, astringent, hot, and sweet—determining which parts would contain which tastes. With knowledge of the different types of beings and the different types of forest, he then began the study of medicine.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1687}} “He thought, ‘There are three types of disease: those that are fatal, those that one survives, and those that are fatal unless treated. These are the types of disease that a skilled doctor must treat with medicine. With regard to the diseases that one survives, one must dispense medicine to avoid future agony. The fatal diseases must be dealt with medically to alleviate present pain {{page:{number:491,folio:F.246.b}}} and bring comfort. Those diseases that can be remedied when treated but otherwise will become fatal must be medically treated in order to protect the life-force. Thus, medical treatment must be provided to dispel the sensations associated with fatal diseases, benefit the life-force with regard to diseases that can be remedied, and eliminate the agony produced by the indeterminate diseases. Hence, medical treatment is provided to dispel painful sensations.’

In those days I was the king and sage Sāgaramati. I provided treatment to those suffering from pain and healed them. I sought to keep those enjoying good health free from affliction by offering them medical treatment. And when I failed to find any cure for someone, I treated them so that they could complete their lives. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattva great beings who wish to awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood must not be lazy when it comes to teaching the Dharma to sentient beings. They must teach everyone genuinely, even if it is at the cost of their lives. When the Dharma is taught genuinely, those who listen will become free from stupidity.

“Long ago in the limitless, incalculable, inconceivable, immeasurable, and inexpressible cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a sage known as Skillful Achiever of the Future. He possessed tremendous miraculous powers and splendor and had attained freedom from attachment to pleasures by means of the outer path. The sage had entered solitary retreat, and when thus practicing meditation, he began to wonder, ‘How can the ripening of karmic action make such different forms of life appear? Sentient beings are of many different kinds and have many different states of mind. Because they experience different afflictions, they engage in different karmic acts. Thus, because their karmic conditioning differs, sentient beings differ as well. In the various hells there are different hell beings, the animal realms include many different kinds of animals, the inhabitants of the realms of the Lord of Death are of different types, and the same is the case with the beings who belong to the realms of demigods, humans, and gods.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1691}} “The sage then asked himself, ‘Might there be some form of medicine that is not just beneficial for certain types of sentient beings? Well, all beings dwell on the self and so they generate many afflictions. The afflicted mind, in turn, engages in acts of karmic formation, and those acts come to ripen in various ways. So I shall examine that self, which thus relates to all of that.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1692}} “ ‘So, could the self be a physical form? The self might appear to have physical form but, as physical forms grow or shrink, people do not perceive the self as simultaneously growing or shrinking. Hence, the self cannot be a physical form. Likewise, the self might be thought to be feelings. However, in happy states of mind the self would then be happiness, in painful states of mind the self would be suffering, and in neutral states of mind the self would be neither suffering nor happiness. That is not how it is with the self, and so the self cannot be feeling. {{page:{number:493,folio:F.247.b}}} If it were perception, the self would transform into happiness with regard to pleasant feelings. It would transform into pain with regard to painful feelings. And it would transform into neither happiness nor pain with regard to feelings that are neither enjoyable nor painful. But such transformation into something else is not characteristic of the self and therefore the self cannot be perception. Moreover, if the self were formation it would be virtuous, unvirtuous, or non-transferring. As such, it would ripen as pleasure, pain, or neither of the two. Yet the self is not held to be virtuous, unvirtuous, or non-transferring, and it therefore cannot be formation. Finally, if consciousness were the self, then why does consciousness transform into happiness, pain, and neutrality with regard to sensations that are either enjoyable, painful, or neither enjoyable nor painful, respectively? The self is not thought to change, and therefore consciousness cannot be the self.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1693}} “The sage then concluded, ‘These five aggregates contain no self and nothing that is of the self. From the afflictions follow karmic actions, and those actions ripen. The ripening of karmic actions brings affliction, and in this way these three factors are uninterrupted.’
“Having emerged from his absorption, the sage went on to teach the Dharma to the fourfold retinue, saying, ‘Friends, here there is neither self nor anything that is of the self. Formations occur when the conditions for those are present, and if their conditions are absent, so are the formations.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1695}} “When the sage taught the Dharma in this way innumerably many tens of thousands of beings gained acceptance that phenomena are unborn. Apart from karmic formation, there is no birth, destruction, or death of anything at all. Afflictions bring karmic action, and karmic action brings ripening. All phenomena {{page:{number:494,folio:F.248.a}}} are devoid of any essence; they are devoid of any essence of affliction, karmic action, or ripening.
“Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time the sage Skillful Achiever of the Future was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was that sage Skillful Achiever of the Future. Through my account of affliction and karmic action innumerably many tens of thousands of beings attained the acceptance that phenomena are unborn. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattva great beings who wish to awaken to unsurpassed and perfect awakening must train in the three principles of karmic action.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1697}} “Maudgalyāyana, when I was training in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, I created vast and boundless roots of virtue in order to understand cessation as related to knowledge of death. I did this by wondering how I could fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood and then teach sentient beings about the knowledge of cessation as related to knowledge of death.
“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a sage named Skilled in the Knowledge of Cessation as Related to the Knowledge of Death. He possessed tremendous miraculous powers and splendor and, by means of the outer path, he had attained freedom from attachment to pleasures and gained the five superknowledges. Bringing to mind all formed things, the sage saw that they disintegrate. So he wondered, ‘Might there be any phenomenon that is not born and does not cease? Conditioned phenomena do come to an end {{note:{index:81,id:UT22084-047-001-1699}}} whereas unconditioned phenomena do not cease.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1700}} “With this correct understanding in mind, the sage then entered the vajra-like absorption that is known as delighting in all unconditioned phenomena. {{page:{number:495,folio:F.248.b}}} While thus dwelling in absorption, he examined and discerned all the mental events of the mindstream, and so he thought, ‘All phenomena arise due to the mind and cease due to the mind. Whatever form a phenomenon takes, it follows from the mind’s way of thinking. The mind gives birth to all phenomena, and the mind brings them all to an end. But what gives the mind such power?’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1701}} “Then he thought, ‘The mind has no form and it cannot be shown. When it arises, the mind does not know its own identity and when it ceases, the mind also does not know its own identity. The mind does not produce itself, and it does not make itself cease either. Such is the mind’s nature. This immaterial quality is the intrinsic nature of things. The cessation of mind is not an object of consciousness. When the mind arises, it forms part of the mind’s continuum and when it ceases, it is also part of the mind’s continuum. The cessation of the aggressive mind is part of the mind’s continuum, and the cessation of the ignorant mind is also part of the mind’s continuum. Thus one speaks of “desire or anger within the mind’s continuum.” With a knowledgeable mind, one will know the mind’s three continua. When, for example, a man searches for a jar in darkness he might light an oil lamp, and the light would then make him see the jar as well as other things. Likewise, when the mind driven by desire ceases, and the mind of knowledge arises, all the mind’s continua will be comprehended. When the mind driven by the wish to harm ceases, and the mind of knowledge arises, all the mind’s continua will be comprehended. When the mind driven by ignorance ceases, and the mind of knowledge arises, all the mind’s continua will be comprehended. With such knowledge {{page:{number:496,folio:F.249.a}}} there is no perception of the features of affliction. There is not even any observation of the mind that consciousness sees as being endowed with knowledge. And why is that so? Because that mind is of a nature that is free of ignorance and pride. That which has no essence at all does not arise, and what does not arise does not cease. That which neither arises nor ceases cannot be cognized, comprehended, relinquished, cultivated, or perceived. Just as it is now, so it was in the past. Just as it was in the past, so it will be in the future. It cannot be cognized, comprehended, relinquished, cultivated, or perceived. Despite this sameness of the three times, ordinary beings who are childish and obscured seek awakening apart from the aggregates. But awakening is nothing other than the aggregates!’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1702}} “When the sage had arisen from his absorption, he then proceeded to teach this nature to sentient beings. He told them, ‘Whatever one trains in, it will yield particular attainments. That which the blessed buddhas of the past attained is beyond increase, decrease, attainment, and destruction. Nevertheless, if one fully recognizes the nature of phenomena, just as it is, then birth is transcendence of suffering, and no birth is transcendence of suffering as well. Cessation is transcendence of suffering, just as no cessation is transcendence of suffering. Entity is transcendence of suffering, and no entity is transcendence of suffering as well.’ As a result of this Dharma teaching, innumerably many tens of thousands of beings gained the acceptance that phenomena are unborn.

His understanding of the three types of knowledge was impeccable, and he possessed miraculous powers through karmic ripening. Living from alms, he accepted the donations of any extremist or outcaste. While thus committed to a beggar’s livelihood, he decided to feed all beings. He therefore prepared feasts that lasted for a thousand, two thousand, three thousand, and even five thousand days.

“The brahmin Joyous Moon, who was like a great sal tree, thought to himself, ‘Almost everyone has visited my wonderful place for the distribution of alms. Yet neither the hearers of the thus-gone Free from All Suffering, nor the thus-gone Free from All Suffering himself, have come to my kitchen.

At first they all traveled in chariots pulled by white mares but when they could no longer travel further in that way, they dismounted and walked to where the thus-gone Free from All Suffering was residing. Finally, they beheld the thus-gone Free from All Suffering seated under a tree. He was fine and handsome, with his senses and mind serene. {{page:{number:499,folio:F.250.b}}} He rested peacefully, having attained true gentleness. He rested calmly, having attained genuine gentleness. He was vigilant and disciplined like an elephant, radiant and pristine like a lake, and shining like a golden reliquary.

That was unfortunate, not something fortunate! The Blessed One is sublime, and must be treated accordingly. I must honor him with the most exquisite foods, bedding, and healing treatments.’
“Thus the brahmin went before the Thus-Gone One, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and placed his right knee on the ground. Taking hold of the blessed thus-gone Free from All Suffering’s hands, he kissed them. Then he declared his name and family line saying, ‘Blessed One, I am the brahmin Joyous Moon, who is like a great sal tree.’ He said this three times and then continued: ‘Blessed One, you are not a monk. You are sublime, and yet I counted you as one among the monks. I have erred, Blessed One. Please know that I have erred. Please allow me to serve you and your saṅgha for along as you remain, offering you bedding and healing treatments.’

But, Joyous Moon, as long as he lives, the Blessed Buddha {{page:{number:500,folio:F.251.a}}} does not act for the sake of just one being. And why not? Because the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddhas appear in the world to benefit the entire world. The Thus-Gone One has appeared out of love for those who lack food, a resting place, clothing, and a home.’
“ ‘Blessed One,’ insisted the brahmin, ‘please allow me to serve you and your saṅgha of hearers with pleasing offerings for at least seven days!’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1713}} “Out of love for the brahmin Joyous Moon, who was like a great sal tree, the thus-gone Free from All Suffering did not reply, and thereby he accepted the invitation. The brahmin Joyous Moon, who was like a great sal tree, understood that the blessed thus-gone Free from All Suffering’s silence was a sign of his acceptance, and so Joyous Moon bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet. He then stood up and returned to his home. Once back home, he gathered his relatives and told them, ‘Please be aware that I have invited the thus-gone Free from All Suffering and his saṅgha of hearers to receive elaborate midday meals here for a period of seven days.

“Together with his relatives, friends, officials, kinsmen, servants, workers, and employees, {{page:{number:501,folio:F.251.b}}} Joyous Moon then built a courtyard and equipped it with seats and various utensils. The next morning he dispatched a messenger, who went before the Thus-Gone One and said, ‘Blessed One, the time has come to visit the brahmin Joyous Moon, who is like a great sal tree.

“ ‘Indeed,’ replied the messenger, and so he returned to Joyous Moon saying, ‘Brahmin, you can prepare the Thus-Gone One’s seat.’
“Having prepared a courtyard that was twelve leagues long and twelve leagues wide, Joyous Moon approached the nāga kings, saying, ‘Friends, please be informed that the Blessed One and his retinue will arrive for their midday meal tomorrow.’
“ ‘Very well,’ replied the nāga kings, thus expressing their approval.

“ ‘We shall do that!’ replied the yakṣas, and in accord with Joyous Moon’s wishes the yakṣas then arranged the seats within the twelve-league enclosure. At the same time, the nāga kings sprinkled the compound with scented waters.

Please ensure that it is not hot while the Thus-Gone One and his saṅgha of hearers are enjoying their meal.’ The nāga rulers also adorned Joyous Moon’s courtyard with their ornaments and erected canopies of jewels and pearls.

Accompanied by his saṅgha of hearers, he then proceeded to the site where the brahmin Joyous Moon, {{page:{number:502,folio:F.252.a}}} who was like a great sal tree, had made the arrangements for the midday meal. There he took his seat and the saṅgha of monks sat down in a row to his left. As soon as the Buddha and the saṅgha of monks had taken their seats, the nāgas and gandharvas gathered to play music, while divine perfumed powders trickled down from the sky.
“At that time the thus-gone Free from All Suffering performed a magical feat. Thus, by the Thus-Gone One’s miraculous doing, the courtyard was extended to measure one hundred leagues and the enclosure became surrounded by a beryl fence adorned with crystal pavilions.

Divine music was played, divine incense burned, and divine perfumes sprinkled. Seeing the Blessed One and his saṅgha of monks partaking of their meal, Joyous Moon covered them with two magnificent cotton fabrics. At that point the location filled up with gods, from the sun and the moon until the limits of the circle, one more splendid than the other. Then, as the brahmin Joyous Moon, who was like a great sal tree, saw that the Blessed One and his saṅgha of monks had completed their meal, he offered them alms bowls and water. Placing his right knee on the ground, he then spoke to the Blessed One: ‘Blessed One, may my gifts be for all sentient beings.

As he did so, {{page:{number:503,folio:F.252.b}}} all the gods, from the sun and the moon until the limits of the circle, as well as all the humans who were present there, became bathed in a golden light . The sage Joyous Moon, who was like a great sal tree, said to the Blessed One, ‘Blessed One, as this light spreads from you, all beings who are touched by it experience undivided faith.

Having awoken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood within their completely pure buddha realms, they will benefit all beings and then pass beyond suffering within the field of nirvāṇa, free from any remainder of the aggregates. All of them have produced this seed of awakening.’ Having declared to all those beings that future awakening will be unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, the Thus-Gone One then rose from his seat and departed.

Thus I venerated, revered, honored, and worshiped the Thus-Gone One with great devotion for one week, so that those beings would receive their prophecy. Although the Thus-Gone One did not grant me a prophecy, I did not feel disheartened, nor did I feel that I could not awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, {{page:{number:504,folio:F.253.a}}} bodhisattvas must serve the thus-gone ones without any laziness. A bodhisattva who serves without laziness will quickly reach the qualities of the irreversible stage.”
Knowledge of Birth
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1726}} “Maudgalyāyana, when I was training in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, I created boundless roots of virtue in order to understand birth. I did this by wondering how I could fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood and then teach sentient beings about the knowledge of birth. I also wondered how, once they had heard about the knowledge of birth, I might best teach about the absence of self in phenomena and about birth.
“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a religious and righteous king named Mahāyasyā. This king possessed tremendous miraculous powers and splendor, and he had attained freedom from attachment to pleasures by means of the outer path. On the fifteenth day of the bright fortnight, the day of the full moon, King Mahāyasyā went to the assembly hall of the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three to participate in a Dharma discussion. Once there, he said, ‘Friends, whenever a thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha appears in the world, then whatever Dharma that buddha teaches is endowed with activity.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1728}} “At that point ninety thousand kings appeared at the assembly hall, including King Topmost Intelligence, King Viṣnumati, King Candramati, King Drop of Intelligence, King Flower Intelligence, King Powerful Intelligence, King Starlight, King Cloud of Intelligence, and King Vimala­candra­mati. Participating in the Dharma discussion, the kings advised, ‘Friends, we must follow those who teach the Dharma, not those who teach non-Dharma. We must follow those who teach the genuine, {{page:{number:505,folio:F.253.b}}} not those who deny the genuine. We must follow those who teach peace, not those who deny peace. We must follow those who teach the truth, not those who deny the truth. Friends, we must follow those who teach emptiness, not those who deny emptiness. Friends, we must follow those who teach that there is no self, not those who teach in terms of a self. The blessed buddhas speak of emptiness, not persons. Friends, the blessed buddhas declare that the twelve inner and outer sense sources are devoid of any essential nature.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1729}} “At that point many in the circle of gods exclaimed loudly and with a clear voice, ‘Friends, how could there be any acts of karmic formation within emptiness? If there were no “I” and “mine,” then what acts of karmic formation could have made us gods take birth in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three?’
“Another group of gods responded, loud and clear, ‘Friends, do not denigrate the teaching of the blessed buddhas. When the five signs appear, gods die and take rebirth. This you know from your own direct perception. But do you see any self of the dying god? How, one may wonder, could a self be harmed in any of those ways? And yet even if we all unite we cannot save a god from harm. At the first sign no self appears, and no self can be claimed to appear at the second, third, fourth, or fifth sign either. We see no self of the dead and dying. Here there is neither self nor anything that is of a self. All phenomena are devoid of self and anything that belongs to it. And thus the words of the blessed buddhas are genuine.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1731}} “King Topmost Intelligence then spoke to the ninety thousand kings: ‘All of you, gather here! Alas, this assembly of gods is in disagreement and lacks realization of the thus-gone ones’ teaching. So let us visit Jambudvīpa for a Dharma discussion. If we have now come to this divine assembly hall for Dharma discussions to suggest that phenomena are in fact not empty, {{page:{number:506,folio:F.254.a}}} and that there is both self and something that is of the self, then this gathering of gods is in error, harboring numerous doubts about the buddhas’ teaching. So come, let us go to Jambudvīpa to have a Dharma discussion!’
“The kings gathered in a group and then said to King Topmost Intelligence, ‘You were born in the central country, not in any of the outlying realms of the east, west, north, or south. Your understanding is expressed in this Dharma.’ {{note:{index:82,id:UT22084-047-001-1733}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1734}} “King Topmost Intelligence then spoke to the kings of the outlying realms: ‘Choose twenty-five kings from the east, twenty-five kings from the west, twenty-five kings from the north, and twenty-five kings from the south. The one hundred kings must be astute, learned, intelligent, not fickle, not making things up, not confused, not hurried, and they must be capable of examining their own stream of being.’
“ ‘As you wish,’ replied the kings, and so they selected one hundred kings in accordance with King Topmost Intelligence’s directions.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1735}} “Arriving there like the king of swans, King Topmost Intelligence now miraculously took up residence upon the king of snow mountains together with the one hundred kings. Through divine emanation a courtyard appeared there, which remained perceptible to all of the divine kings. The gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three then created a throne for King Topmost Intelligence out of the seven precious substances and placed it in the middle of the group of one hundred kings. Having prostrated in the ten directions, King Topmost Intelligence then took seat upon his throne, while the ninety-nine other kings bowed to his feet and gathered around him.
“The gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three witnessed this with joy, delight, and appreciation. ‘The sacred Dharma,’ {{page:{number:507,folio:F.254.b}}} they thought, ‘is manifest for the humans of Jambudvīpa. For a while still the sacred Dharma shall not fade.’ The gods then let a rain of divine mandārava flowers fall, and they gathered happily to listen to the sacred Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1737}} “At this point King Topmost Intelligence spoke to a royal messenger: ‘Friend, upon the summit of this snow mountain lives a sage by the name of Sādhumati. Please go and invite him here, and let him know that these kings wish to see him.’
“ ‘As you wish,’ replied the messenger and so, as fast as an athlete can bend or stretch an arm, he disappeared from the royal gathering and reappeared before the sage. The messenger bowed his head to the sage’s feet, and then explained to him the character of his errand. When the sage heard about the thus-gone Bhūbhṛta’s having passed beyond suffering, and of what had transpired since then, he shed tears of compassion. As the sage’s tears flowed, their warmth melted the cape of the king of snow mountains. Then he said to the messenger, ‘Friend, since there are beings who have seen and listened to that thus-gone one, the sacred Dharma remains. It has not faded. Leave on your own, I shall not go. I do not wish to let go of the peaceful rest of the thus-gone ones, and instead involve myself in mundane diversions.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1739}} “The sage then continued: ‘Friend, let me resolve the issue that the gods are debating about whether there is a self or not. If there were a self, there ought to be no aging, death, or disease. And why? Because the self is not born, does not age, does not die, and does not appreciate generosity. Therefore, there is no self.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1740}} “When the sage gave this teaching the messenger attained the dustless and stainless Dharma eye that sees the teachings. {{page:{number:508,folio:F.255.a}}} Flying through the sky like the king of swans, he returned to the group of kings. In approaching, he spoke to them from sky: ‘Friends, the sacred Dharma remains, the teaching of the thus-gone ones is ablaze. Whoever applies effort will be able to extract the essence of the thus-gone ones’ teachings. For those who lack diligence no buddha appears, no Dharma is heard, and no Dharma will be comprehended. Lacking diligence, they will regress. Yet for the diligent the Dharma remains: “All that is conditioned is impermanent; all that is conditioned is suffering; all phenomena are devoid of self; passing beyond suffering is peace.” The winds carry these words throughout the ten directions!’
“Upon hearing these words those who were proponents of a self came to abide within the absence of self, and those who were proponents of no-self completed their tasks. All of that happened due to Topmost Intelligence’s power.

In those days I was the King Topmost Intelligence and thus I established all those beings in the Dharma. I caused the words of the teachings to be heard throughout the entire trichiliocosm and, because I had served tens of thousands of buddhas in the past, I had great compassion for sentient beings. That is how the words of Dharma emerged. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattva great beings must emit the lion’s roar free from any shyness concerning the blessed buddhas’ teachings.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1743}} “Maudgalyāyana, when I was training in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, I created numerous different roots of virtue in order to understand the origin as related to knowledge of birth.

“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a thus-gone one named Hundreds of Light Rays. At that time this universe remained free from harm, abiding without disintegration or formation. {{page:{number:509,folio:F.255.b}}} From each light ray there would appear innumerable buddha emanations, streaming out into innumerable universes of the ten directions. These emanations, who were in perfect accord with the wishes of beings, matured innumerably many tens of thousands of beings. These emanations taught the Dharma in agreement with the inclinations of beings. In this manner the buddha realm of that thus-gone one encompassed innumerable trichiliocosms throughout which emanations were ripening sentient beings, and so the Thus-Gone One himself resided in boundless buddha realms, bringing innumerable bodhisattvas to maturation.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1745}} “At that time there was a monk known as Flawless Eyes who was serving the Thus-Gone One, and he knew well the thoughts of all the beings whom the Thus-Gone One’s emanations were ripening. Whenever the Thus-Gone One would teach the Dharma, the monk would do the same. Whenever he heard the Thus-Gone One teach, the monk would offer his service. In this way innumerably many tens of thousands of beings awoke to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood simply due to the service rendered by the monk.
“Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time the monk Flawless Eyes was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was that monk Flawless Eyes. Having heard the Thus-Gone One’s Dharma teaching, I established innumerably many tens of thousands of beings at the irreversible level.

When this happened the beings of the realm were amazed and wondered, ‘Where does this light come from?’ A voice could then be heard from the sky, telling them, ‘The buddha realms are all pervaded by the light of the thus-gone ones.

“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a king known as Perceiving the Nature of All Beings. Astute and intelligent, the king was an expert in recognizing the compositions of the faculties of sentient beings.

These beings are tormented and scorched by their desire for form. At the time of their death, may their desiring minds not compel them to take birth in the hells! Tormented by the fires of desire, beings are born in hells where infernal fires torment them. This double torment keeps them tied in the shackles of death. Thus, oppressed by suffering they take birth, die, and wander from this world to the next.’

Still, as when a firebrand is spinning, beings misapprehend appearances, and so they act with desire, believing that they are relating to something that is pure. Thus they remain bound throughout birth, aging, and death. Racing around in circles, they do not understand where all this begins.’
“With this understanding the king repeatedly taught sentient beings correctly about the unclean. Thereby, innumerably many tens of thousands of beings understood the concept of impurity, began to think in terms of the unclean, and comprehended the essential nature of all phenomena. {{page:{number:517,folio:F.259.b}}} With such understanding innumerably many tens of thousands of beings reversed their desires by means of the concept of impurity.

{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1898}} “Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time the sage Unhindered Knowledge was anyone else, do not think so. In those days I was the sage Unhindered Knowledge. I relied on, trained in, and increased the bases of miraculous absorption and I traveled throughout numerous buddha realms, establishing innumerably many tens of thousands of beings in the acceptance that phenomena are unborn. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas must abide by the four bases of miraculous absorption, and they must accept that phenomena are unborn. Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattva great beings who accept that phenomena are unborn will quickly awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1899}} “Maudgalyāyana, when I was training in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, I created boundless roots of virtue in order to understand the path that leads to cessation as related to knowledge of the defilement of ignorance. I did this by wondering how I could fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood and then teach sentient beings about the knowledge of the path that leads to cessation as related to knowledge of the defilement of ignorance.
“Long ago in the limitless cycle of existence, Maudgalyāyana, long before even the distant past there was a sage known as Seer of Knowledge Free from Obscuration, who possessed great miraculous powers and splendor, and had attained freedom from attachment to pleasures by means of the outer path. The sage went into solitude and, while thus practicing meditation, he asked himself, ‘What are phenomena, and what are the factors that obscure phenomena?’ He then thought, ‘There are no phenomena {{page:{number:548,folio:F.275.a}}} at all, nor are there any factors that obscure them. And why is that? Because all phenomena are devoid of essential nature. For example, space does not obscure space. And why is that? Because space is devoid of essential nature.’
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1901}} “Arising from his absorption of proper mindfulness, the sage proclaimed, ‘Friends, no phenomenon has any essential nature! Therefore, there are no factors that obscure phenomena at all!’ As the sage’s words were spoken, the winds of the four directions took them and carried them everywhere. When they heard that message, innumerably many tens of thousands of beings attained the absorption in which all phenomena lack essential nature.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1902}} “Maudgalyāyana, in case you may think that at that time the sage Seer of Knowledge Free from Obscuration was anyone else, do not think so. And why not? Because in those days I was the sage Seer of Knowledge Free from Obscuration. My words were carried everywhere by the winds of the four directions and, upon hearing my message that all phenomena are devoid of essential nature, beings gained acceptance that phenomena are unborn. Therefore, Maudgalyāyana, bodhisattvas who wish to awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood must pursue the absence of essential nature in all phenomena.” Thus spoke the Blessed One.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1903}} At this point venerable Maudgalyāyana said, “Blessed One, it is amazing how profound and vast the wisdom of the blessed buddhas is! As I understand the meaning of what the Blessed One has conveyed here, the buddha realm of the Buddha extends as far as his buddha knowledge, which tames beings in every single buddha realm.
“A noble son or daughter of the Blessed One in pursuit and search of merit may fill universes as numerous as the atoms of ineffably many buddha realms {{page:{number:549,folio:F.275.b}}} with jewels, and they may offer such jewels to the blessed ones for as many eons as there are atoms in innumerably many buddha realms. Yet their accumulation of merit cannot match what is achieved by retaining, mastering, upholding, and explaining to others this Dharma teaching, which unfolds the wisdom of the Blessed One. Even just writing it down and carrying it will create greater merit.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1905}} The Blessed One replied to Mahā­maudgalyāyana: “Thus it is, Mahā­maudgalyāyana. What you say is true. Maudgalyāyana, think of it this way. Imagine that all beings in as many worlds in the ten directions as there are atoms within ineffably many buddha realms all at once were to become human beings. If these beings were to awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, then each of these thus-gone ones would have as many heads. Each of these blessed buddhas would then have as many mouths as there were heads, and as many tongues as there were mouths. {{note:{index:92,id:UT22084-047-001-1906}}} How can this be? Because, Maudgalyāyana, the Thus-Gone One possesses immeasurable wisdom, unfathomable wisdom, incalculable wisdom, inconceivable wisdom, limitless wisdom, and inestimable wisdom. Maudgalyāyana, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha possesses inexpressible wisdom.”
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-2548}} When the Blessed One had spoken, venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One.
{{milestone:UT22084-047-001-1908}} This completes the Great Vehicle sūtra, “ The Precious Discourse on the Blessed One’s Extensive Wisdom That Leads to Infinite Certainty .”
