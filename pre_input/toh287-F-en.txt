The Heaven Free from Strife
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1843,id:UT22084-068-021-4397}}}Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!
“The karmic effects of life as a god in the realms of the Heaven Free from Strife and the guardians of the world always manifest on the basis of cause and effect.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1844,id:UT22084-068-021-4399}}}“When the monk who has knowledge of the effects of the ripening of karmic actions has examined the exhilarated gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, he will next wonder about the identity of the gods who reside above them, and who are superior in terms of splendor, diligence, joy, radiance, and lifespan. Through his knowledge derived from hearing, he will see that those gods, who are far superior to the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three in terms of the methods they have applied in the past, and in terms of the ripening of their karmic qualities, are known as the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife. He will also notice that beings are born in that heaven by observing various forms of discipline. Those gods have abandoned killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. They have practiced discipline in a way that is uncorrupted, unbroken, undefiled, and stable, thereby pleasing all the noble ones. Since they possess the karmic ripening of constant discipline, they will become spiritual practitioners who contemplate reality and pass beyond the ocean of existence by traveling across the bridge of discipline, the bridge that spans the ocean of cyclic existence and leads to the city of the transcendence of suffering. Just as before, their sevenfold discipline can be distinguished in terms of inferior, intermediate, and excellent levels.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1845,id:UT22084-068-021-4400}}} “Observing the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife, in whom positive past actions and spiritual qualities have ripened, he will see, {{page:{number:1040,id:UT22084-068-021-101067,folio:F.284.b,volume:V69}}} through knowledge derived from hearing, their lofty abodes near the king of mountains, Mount Sumeru, as well as their appearance and splendor, the distinctive features of their lofty abodes, as well as the number of these gods. He will notice that sentient beings attain those abodes by relying on, cultivating, and repeatedly engaging in the practices consisting in abandoning killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct, by teaching and establishing others in those practices, and by engaging in activities that benefit both themselves and others.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1846,id:UT22084-068-021-4401}}} “Observing the height of those abodes, he will notice that they are located at an elevation of 168,000 leagues. He will then see that the Heaven Free from Strife—situated twice as high as Mount Sumeru—is divided into twenty-seven individual realms. Those abodes of the Heaven Free from Strife span five thousand leagues and hover in space, supported by the surrounding winds, like clouds. Just as this earth is supported at its base by wind, water, and rivers, so the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife are supported by the single factor of the billowing wind, as if they were cloudbanks. All in all their abodes include the following twenty-seven realms: Supreme Strength, Moving in the Stream, Living on the Peak, Ornament of the Mind, Moving in Mixed Environments, Movement of Wind, Utterly Lofty, Endowed with Result, Total Pleasure, Endowed with Migration, Emanation of a Hundred Light Rays, Controlled Movement, Constant Bliss, Endowed with Increasing Bliss, Moving in Mountain Ranges, Shining in Manifold Ways, Pleasure Grove of the Moon Vision, Dwelling in the Environment, Devoid of the Sound of Concentration, Turning Away from Pride, Engaged Conduct, Sporting among Moving Groups, Moving in One’s Land, Infatuation with One’s Body, Splendor of the Signs of Pride, Supreme Pleasure Grove, and Light Rays of the Forest. {{page:{number:1041,id:UT22084-068-021-101068,folio:F.285.a,volume:V69}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1847,id:UT22084-068-021-4402}}} “In those realms, the ruler of the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife is known as Musulundha; he reigns as the sovereign leader. Musulundha rules over the realms of the Heaven Free from Strife, just as Śakra rules over the Four Great Kings and the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. He follows the Dharma and is a thousand times superior to Śakra in terms of qualities, size, and pleasures. His body measures five leagues and has the nature of light. It is said that Śakra measures one mile in height. Musulundha, who governs the realms of the Heaven Free from Strife, is much bigger than Kauśika. The size of one thousand bodies of Śakra cannot even match the size of a single limb of Musulundha’s body. This is because extraordinary causes yield extraordinary results. At this point, the monk will recite this verse:
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1848,id:UT22084-068-021-4403}}}“ ‘Just as a boat holding a small load
Floats and does not sink,
So beings who commit few evil deeds
Do not fall from their elevated abodes.
Just as trees are firmly rooted,
So is this heavenly world.’
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1849,id:UT22084-068-021-4404}}}“Observing the pleasures attained by the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife as a consequence of their past karmic actions, the monk will notice that their abode is home to four great mountain ranges. Each of those mountain ranges measures ten thousand leagues, and they are called Utter Purity, Buoyancy, Great Buoyancy, and Vast Space. These mountain ranges, which are unlike the ranges found in other realms, contain thousands of mountains, each displaying a variety of magnificent colors, shapes, and qualities. They are carpeted with heavenly flowers and densely populated by the gods of the Heaven Free from Strife. The twenty-seven realms are filled with mountains of various shapes; studded with hundreds of thousands of waterfalls, rivers, pools, parks, and woods; {{page:{number:1042,id:UT22084-068-021-101069,folio:F.285.b,volume:V69}}} and covered by a profusion of trees and lotus ponds with perfect shapes, smells, colors, and tastes. In comparison, the mountains, rivers, pools, forests, and parks in the realms of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three do not seem very special, just as the joys of the trees, rivers, pools, forests, and parks in the human realm cannot compare to the joys that are experienced by the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1850,id:UT22084-068-021-4405}}} “The unique cause that pertains to the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife involves a strong causal relationship. Stated otherwise, such a birth is a result that arises in conformity with an abundance of merit accumulated through wholesome actions. It is impossible to describe the manifestations produced by virtuous karmic action. No one is able to describe all the causes that produce the variety of concordant actions, and no one is able to describe all the outcomes of these unnameable causal actions. Why? Because there are simply no words to describe the extent of such causal actions.{{note:{index:350,id:UT22084-068-021-4406}}} Here, I will therefore only describe a hundred thousandth fraction of the wealth that those gods of equal fortune possess.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1851,id:UT22084-068-021-4407}}} “Nevertheless, I must by all means explain the consequences of following a guileless form of discipline. This will generate strong enthusiasm in those who practice discipline and a degree of enthusiasm ten times stronger in those who possess wisdom. There is a big difference between discipline and insight. Through discipline, one takes rebirth as a god, and through wisdom, one reaches the transcendence of suffering. Thus, if someone describes the excellent qualities of discipline, those who possess insight will think, ‘If such results manifest for those who practice discipline, what, then, will be the results for us who possess insight!’ Furthermore, by generating such strong enthusiasm, those beings will put effort into developing their insight, and, as a consequence, they will lose their fondness for cyclic existence. {{page:{number:1043,id:UT22084-068-021-101070,folio:F.286.a,volume:V69}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1852,id:UT22084-068-021-4408}}} “There is another reason for describing the higher realms; if even those beings who live for such a long time in those abodes and experience very little harm are subject to destruction, there is no need to mention the helpless world of humans, where beings seek to defeat one another, engage in wrongdoings, are small minded and unstable, harm each other, and develop such inclinations routinely and on a vast scale—a world full of the dangers caused by thieves, floods, or royal punishments.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1853,id:UT22084-068-021-4409}}} “There is yet another reason for this, which is that there are some who think, ‘Those beings endowed with great magical powers are emanated by the Almighty and have no other cause than that.’ In order to refute that idea, the nature of these results is explained. There are no karmic effects that arise without causes. Such effects are not caused by the kindness of others, nor do they manifest just as one may wish. They arise based on similar causes. Causes will not create effects that are unrelated to them. There are no causes consisting in wholesome actions that result in a rebirth within the hell realms. Likewise, there are no causes consisting in unwholesome actions that result in a rebirth within the higher realms.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1854,id:UT22084-068-021-4410}}} “Therefore, since this is the fundamental character of cause and effect, this account of the higher realms is concerned with the essential actions of generosity, discipline, insight, training, and certainty. There are two types of discussion: one concerns happiness—the happiness of the gods—and the other concerns suffering—the suffering of hell beings. It is not possible to talk about them both here. I will therefore only discuss the actions related to the former.
The Gods in Supreme Strength
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1855,id:UT22084-068-021-4412}}}“Next, as the monk who has knowledge of the effects of the ripening of karmic actions examines the realms of the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife, he will apply knowledge derived from hearing and so correctly see a realm called Supreme Strength. Wondering what karmic actions cause people to be born there, he will examine this matter with knowledge derived from hearing and so see that there are holy people who observe discipline and {{page:{number:1044,id:UT22084-068-021-101071,folio:F.286.b,volume:V69}}} shun even the smallest misdeed. They are honest and sincere, free from deceit, and do not torment others. They have the genuine view and are guided by that. They always correctly see this world as impermanent, painful, empty, and devoid of self. They practice the recollection of the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha and observe the discipline of giving up killing and stealing in the way that was explained before.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1856,id:UT22084-068-021-4413}}} “They do not engage in sexual misconduct either. Sexual misconduct refers to wishing for and engaging in sexual intercourse with someone who is associated with and bound to another. Having learned this, such holy beings will, if they see someone who is associated with and bound to another, not think about, consider, or contemplate that person. Moreover, they will dissuade those who entertain such thoughts about engaging in sexual misconduct by pointing out the consequences of such actions, telling them, ‘Don’t do this or you will be born into the hell realms!’ In this way they confidently explain the nature of karmic actions and their results without letting others influence them. When their bodies disintegrate, they will go to the joyous higher realms and be born among the gods in Supreme Strength within the Heaven Free from Strife.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1857,id:UT22084-068-021-4414}}} “Those who are born there have maintained a wholesome livelihood and shunned sexual misconduct. When they are born into that realm, they will be surrounded by a hundred thousand gods and goddesses who sing for them. Like being woken up by drums from a deep sleep, as soon as they are miraculously born there, the melodies of songs and drums endowed with eight qualities will resound everywhere, and they will regain their senses. The songs that awaken them are appropriate, agreeable, auspicious, profound, and delightful, {{page:{number:1045,id:UT22084-068-021-101072,folio:F.287.a,volume:V69}}} are clearly audible across eighty thousand leagues, and teach the Dharma, and they are completely clear. Such are the eight qualities of the songs that wake up those who have previously engaged in very wholesome actions. The light emanating from their bodies shines up to a distance of five leagues and is comprised of blue, yellow, red, and rainbow-like colors. That light starts to shine the moment they stand up.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1858,id:UT22084-068-021-4415}}} “Adorned in their garments, the gods are as radiant as the sun and the moon. When they have awoken, they will joyfully proceed to a grove known as Forest of Splendor surrounded by a hundred thousand other gods. That area of the Heaven Free from Strife abounds with groups of gods and goddesses and is studded with two types of flowers known as eye nectar and fragrance nectar. These flowers have the most exquisite colors and sumptuous fragrances. They never wither and are delightful even to hear about. The potency of those flowers are such that whenever someone remembers their names, their fragrances are sensed from the sky. Among the leaves of the trees in the grove there also grow two flowers called brighter than the moon and moving everywhere. Whenever the gods wish, those flowers come to them, and they transport the gods wherever they want to go. For transportation, the gods also ride on the trees. Staying in flower mansions too, they travel through the sky to wherever they want. Just like the gods who journey in celestial palaces, the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife travel while residing inside flower mansions. Emitting a blazing light, they can reach anywhere in the world in the blink of an eye, without ever growing weary.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1859,id:UT22084-068-021-4416}}} “They also enjoy the trees that are called directly connected homes of joy. When the gods enter among them, they will find that those trees are far more delightful than the most pleasurable forests, pools, and parks anywhere else. {{page:{number:1046,id:UT22084-068-021-101073,folio:F.287.b,volume:V69}}} Due to the splendor of the trees, the gods are able to attract, according their wishes, each and every one of the magnificent objects found throughout the Heaven Free from Strife. Enraptured by their splendor, the gods enjoy themselves among those trees to the incomparable accompaniment of drums endowed with the eight qualities.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1860,id:UT22084-068-021-4417}}} “There is another type of tree called manifesting fragrance that has the power to manifest any possible fragrance that the gods may desire. In other trees called delightful flower house, the gods establish homes while enjoying the forests, parks, and pools. The trees already are blue, yellow, and red and possess a variety of excellent fragrances and colors, but as soon as the gods enter among them, the trees and the flowers bloom in all kinds of colors, and they even cause the gods to absorb those same colors. Although the gods take on the same colors, these hues are not permanent. Such is the power of those trees and flowers.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1861,id:UT22084-068-021-4418}}} “Riding on the trees called moving through space, the gods can travel a hundred thousand leagues through the sky in the blink of an eye. They journey at will and their splendor equals that of the sun. Adorned with many types of splendid garlands, fragrant powders, and ointments, the gods in that realm travel on their trees surrounded by a hundred thousand other gods and goddesses. During their travels, cheerful goddesses with the most exquisite physiques, who wear shimmering garments made of precious gems, fill the sky in front of them for many thousands of leagues, dancing, performing, posing, and singing songs. Since those gods have pursued positive courses of action in the past, those experiences now manifest within their minds. Here, I have given some examples using familiar descriptions, but these are a mere approximation of the actual experience of those gods. {{page:{number:1047,id:UT22084-068-021-101074,folio:F.288.a,volume:V69}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1862,id:UT22084-068-021-4419}}} “Beautified by a hundred thousand past wholesome actions, like the moon amid moving stars, those gods will then proceed to that forest, all the while calling out in various ways, singing, laughing, posing, and playing music. The surroundings of the forest are utterly delightful. Home to hundreds of thousands of birds, it is adorned with many waterfalls and pools, and it shines brighter than a hundred thousand suns. To provide a comparison that may give some slight indication, the unique qualities of the most delightful forests, waterfalls, shores, and beautifully embanked pools that may be found in the human realms cannot match even a sixteenth of the unique qualities of the forests and parks found in the realms of the Four Great Kings. Similarly, the forests found in the realms of the Four Great Kings cannot, in terms of the pleasures experienced in those places, match even a sixteenth of the delightful forests and parks found in the realms of the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. Those increasing degrees of pleasure are directly proportional to the amount of virtuous or unvirtuous actions that one has previously performed. Not even through the combined insight of all intelligent and eloquent beings, who are one-pointedly focused on virtue without ever engaging in any other activity, could a mere fraction of this pleasure be expressed.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1863,id:UT22084-068-021-4420}}} “Why is this so? Because one cannot conceive of something inconceivable. Therefore, no human or god in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, including their lord, could ever describe even a mere fraction of all the pleasure experienced by the gods in the Yāma Heaven—even if given a hundred thousand years to do so. Why? Because those are not the domains of the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, and those realms cannot be perceived by them. What I have described here by means of examples can never be seen or heard. {{page:{number:1048,id:UT22084-068-021-101075,folio:F.288.b,volume:V69}}} Here I have simply praised a fraction of the experience of those gods to inspire beings to strive in virtue. I have seen and depicted only a tiny fraction of all the inconceivable forms of pleasure and happiness that are certain to be experienced as a consequence of completed and accumulated virtuous actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1864,id:UT22084-068-021-4421}}} “When a skilled and experienced artist, or that artist’s apprentice, draws a representation of the moon or the sun, he or she is not able to capture its actual light, its light rays, its circular movements in the sky, its brilliance, its smoothness, or its harmful aspects. Such a person can only draw its approximate shape. Similarly, the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife cannot be described here. The simple depiction I have provided does not capture their actual joys and powers, the forests and parks where they live, their splendor, their mountains, their natures, the sense pleasures they indulge in, their brilliance, their garlands, or the pleasures they enjoy while traveling in the company of the goddesses. Here, I have only given a slight indication.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1865,id:UT22084-068-021-4422}}} “Next, together with goddesses from that pleasure grove, the gods will travel to lands that abound with fine embankments and parks offering numerous pleasures and attractions. Agitated by their extreme attachment to the five sense pleasures, they are carried away by the river of cyclic existence, shaken by the waves of their flickering thoughts. Those gods are enraptured by everything they see. Observing their divine realm, they see that the forests are filled with the most delightful sense pleasures, rivers, waterfalls, trees and branches, and mansions draped with vines, as well as hundreds of thousands of singing birds. As they approach, they discover all around them the most perfect attractions of a kind they have never seen before. Surrounded by coteries of goddesses, {{page:{number:1049,id:UT22084-068-021-101076,folio:F.289.a,volume:V69}}} they see that the sand on the strips of land that lie between the rivers is made of pearls and is home to birds with golden, silver, and sapphire-like feathers. The banks of the great rivers are studded with trees that produce various melodies. There, on the banks of the rivers, they will then frolic and play around in the company of groups of charming and ravishing goddesses.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1866,id:UT22084-068-021-4423}}} “After being attended to in various ways and having enjoyed the pleasures in that setting for a very long time, they will all together proceed to the forest called Jewel Shore. Upon entering that forest, they will see that the shining forest ground is formed from the seven precious substances and supports delightful mountains with peaks of precious gems. The forest features enrapturing riverbanks, waterfalls, pools, and lotus ponds, where a hundred thousand gorgeous bees swarm. The gods find that everything about this place is delightful, and they enjoy the vistas of the mountain ranges. Endowed with faculties that result from their previous wholesome actions, the gods will frolic, enjoy themselves, and indulge in pleasures in that jewel park amid troupes of goddesses. The pleasures experienced by the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife are produced by roots of virtue, and the numerous resultant enjoyments there manifest in accordance with such virtuous causal factors. In those realms, the gods experience levels of happiness that are superior to even a hundred thousand of the other forms of pleasure one can imagine.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1867,id:UT22084-068-021-4424}}} “When they have indulged in the pleasures of the five senses within that forest, they will next proceed to a location in the Heaven Free from Strife known as No Lack of Embankments. There, they will enjoy a variety of perfect pleasures and take delight in songs performed by troupes of divine singers wearing various costumes. All of this is indescribable. Overwhelmed by their deluded thoughts, the minds of such beings, whose hearts are consumed by the fire of craving, never take a pause. Longing for sense objects, their monkey-like, distorted minds pursue mirages, {{page:{number:1050,id:UT22084-068-021-101077,folio:F.289.b,volume:V69}}} and thus they carelessly indulge in the divine pleasures that are the result of their own previous acts. As they keep on cultivating their passion for women, they will drift from place to place, carried away by the river of their many pleasures. All around the realms in the Heaven Free from Strife grow magnificent lotuses made of precious substances. All those extraordinary and delightful sense pleasures cannot be robbed from those gods, but they never satisfy their senses. Those charming lotuses blossom according to the gods’ wishes and grow simply by being thought of. Such are the effect of the gods’ past positive actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1868,id:UT22084-068-021-4425}}} “At that point, Musulundha will think, ‘Ah! I shall now remain in the sky together with these gods.’ As soon as that thought has arisen, Musulundha, ruler of the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife, will rise up into the middle of the sky together with all the gods that surround him. While traveling in the sky, Musulundha and the gods do not have to move at all or say a word, and not the slightest part of their body changes. In this manner, riding on lotus flowers, all the gods fly through the sky. Accompanied by the beats of the five types of drums, dancing, laughing, enjoying themselves, filled with bliss, captivated by and enjoying the fives sense pleasures, the cheerful gods travel on lotus petals. As in all perfect abodes, the surface of those flowers gives way when one places a foot on them, and it bounces back up when one lifts the foot again.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1869,id:UT22084-068-021-4426}}} “When the gods travel on the petals of those lotuses made of the seven precious substances, each layer of petals is more beautiful than the one before. The petals are as radiant as the sun when it rises and sets in the human realm and illuminates the sky in copper-like colors. Enjoying each other’s company, all those gods will then {{page:{number:1051,id:UT22084-068-021-101078,folio:F.290.a,volume:V69}}} cheerfully travel to the utterly smooth and lofty mountain peak upon which lies a forest called Forest of the Assembly of Kubera. After reaching that mountain peak, they will proceed to a beautiful blossoming lotus grove that is adorned with many waterfalls, rivers, and pools formed from the seven precious substances. That place shines brighter than the light rays of a hundred suns and is home to many gatherings of gods and goddesses. The smooth and lofty mountain and its lotus grove are composed of many precious substances and studded with trees that shine in the same color as the sun. Arriving in that mountain’s forest, the gods will dance and enjoy themselves all together. They will then enter lotuses that grow a hundred thousand petals. Once inside those lotuses, they will start ascending that smooth and lofty mountain.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1870,id:UT22084-068-021-4427}}} “With the intention to have a joyful experience, Musulundha, ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife, will surround himself with throngs of gods and then journey to this place where the gods enjoy themselves in this manner. Upon seeing him, the delighted gods will dance, laugh, and celebrate. Also, Musulundha, lord of the Heaven Free from Strife, will become completely exhilarated.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1871,id:UT22084-068-021-4428}}} “The modes of birth of the gods are the fruition of their predominant karmic actions. Those actions produce inferior, intermediate, or superior gods; they also yield inferior, intermediate, or superior results, engender inferior, intermediate, or superior bodies, and give rise to inferior, intermediate, or superior pleasures. Śakra will never enjoy even a sixteenth of the most inferior forms of pleasure that are experienced by the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife. If it is impossible to describe the level of happiness experienced by Śakra, then how could anyone adequately describe the level of happiness that is enjoyed by the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife? The actions that those gods have practiced are three hundred times superior. Here I have described the fruition of positive actions and the flourishing of merit by extolling the sublime pleasures that are experienced by the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife. {{page:{number:1052,id:UT22084-068-021-101079,folio:F.290.b,volume:V69}}} I have not done so to induce clinging to cyclic existence, but to generate strong enthusiasm in those who observe discipline.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1872,id:UT22084-068-021-4429}}} “Once Musulundha, the ruler of the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife, has discovered the myriad qualities that are so excellent and incomparable within the lotuses and on that smooth and lofty mountain made of the seven precious substances, he will think to himself, ‘Ah! I must now enter this great lotus and remain there to enjoy its supreme pleasures, together with all the congregations of gods and my retinue of queens.’ So Musulundha, ruler of the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife, will place himself at the center of that lotus. By this mere act, and through the power of his past wholesome actions, the heart of the lotus opens up. In this way everyone can proceed to the innermost part of the lotus. A hollow will then appear in the center of the lotus, and from that opening light begins to shine. The light that radiates from the center of that great lotus is of a kind the gods have never before seen or heard of. Light rays spanning more than a hundred leagues now blaze forth in sundry colors. While this light shines from the center of the lotus, the gods and Musulundha, ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife, will all cry out in wonder. The ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife will then say, ‘Gods, look well at the light that shines from this great lotus!’
 “ ‘We see the light,’ the gods will answer. ‘It shines in the most amazing manner!’ {{page:{number:1053,id:UT22084-068-021-101080,folio:F.291.a,volume:V69}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1873,id:UT22084-068-021-4431}}} “ ‘Regardless of its size,’ the ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife will then continue, ‘we and everyone associated with our lands should enter the inner core of this great lotus and gaze at it for a long time!’
 “All the gods will agree and say, ‘We shall do as the ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife has said. Together with our retinues and surrounded by groups of gods and goddesses, we shall all follow the ruler of the Heaven free from Strife as he enters this great lotus.’
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1874,id:UT22084-068-021-4433}}} “Musulundha, surrounded by throngs of gods and goddesses, will then proceed to the center of the lotus to gaze at its interior and marvel in wonder. Reaching the opening at its heart, they will enter it. When sunlight and refined gold shine upon each other, it is as if a second sun appears in the sky. Similarly, when the gods gaze at the dazzling features of that great lotus, they will not be able to bear the brilliance of the light rays, and so they will have to close their eyes. Upon entering the lotus, they will cry out in utter delight, ‘Never have we seen or felt such an incomparable light before!’
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1875,id:UT22084-068-021-4434}}} “Musulundha will lead the way, quickly followed by the gods. Overjoyed and insatiable, Musulundha will enter the lotus accompanied by the gods. Once inside, they will encounter hundreds of forests illuminated by the light of hundreds of thousands of precious gems, hundreds of thousands of luminous mansions, and hundreds of thousands of radiant trees. They will discover areas adorned with hundreds of thousands of forests and parks—each made of the seven precious substances {{page:{number:1054,id:UT22084-068-021-101081,folio:F.291.b,volume:V69}}} and filled with hundreds of thousands of beautiful birds in numerous colors and shapes—hundreds of delightful mountains, pools, palaces, and waterfalls; as well as hundreds of springs, ponds, rivers, thickets, and caves. Everything is composed of the seven precious substances and the colors, shapes, and dimensions are enrapturing. If even the lord of the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife has never seen such things before, there is no need to mention the other gods in that realm.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1876,id:UT22084-068-021-4435}}} “The lakes found inside the lotus are filled with pristine heavenly water. Some have banks made of crystal, others contain silver stones and sand, some are of refined gold, others are of sapphire, still others are of ruby, and some are made of a combination of different precious gems.

When those causes are present, their suffering will greatly increase, they will remain bound to cyclic existence, they will not be able to reach the transcendence of suffering, they will not be free from their attachments, and they will never experience happiness but only misfortune.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1948,id:UT22084-068-021-4514}}} “ ‘ “What are those nine causes of carelessness? The first is spending time ogling women. This leads beings to follow their unrestrained faculties by means of an impure body, speech, or mind. The carelessness of sentient beings comes from the single cause of lacking control due to unrestrained faculties. This agitation is related to indulging in inappropriate objects through an improperly motivated body, speech, or mind, and thus to lacking the inclination to listen to the sublime Dharma. Such careless beings do not engage in wholesome actions through their bodies, their speech, or their minds. Since they do not engage in wholesome actions through body, speech, or mind, they will instead engage in negativities with body, speech, or mind, {{page:{number:1071,id:UT22084-068-021-101098,folio:F.300.a,volume:V69}}} thereby completing and accumulating negative actions. Such fools will, after they die, be born in the unwholesome lower realms as hell beings, starving spirits, or animals because they have been completely corrupted by carelessness. For those reasons, sublime beings who always long for virtue should completely abandon carelessness. This is the first cause of carelessness.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1949,id:UT22084-068-021-4515}}} “ ‘ “Saumya, the second cause that leads to the development of carelessness consists in the opposing factors that destroy the roots of virtue. When beings with restless minds gawk at forms with their eyes, this will generate discursive thoughts. Repeatedly entertaining those thoughts, they will exclusively engage with those objects out of attachment. This will become a habit, and they will therefore only engage in unvirtuous actions. Those beings do not apply mindfulness and their minds are distracted. When their bodies disintegrate, they will be born among hell beings in the unwholesome lower realms. This is the second cause of carelessness.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1950,id:UT22084-068-021-4516}}} “ ‘ “The third cause of carelessness is as follows. Those who do not follow the genuine Dharma, whose minds have not mingled with the Dharma, and who have not heard the Dharma before will give rise to profuse thinking. Whether their thoughts are based on desire, anger, or ignorance, when they think, their minds will pursue their thoughts without any other concern, and thus their minds will become distracted. Completely bound by this third cause of carelessness, they will engage in negative forms of behavior by way of their bodies, speech, and minds. When their bodies disintegrate, they will be born among hell beings in the unwholesome lower realms. This degeneracy is the third cause of carelessness.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1951,id:UT22084-068-021-4517}}} “ ‘ “There is also a fourth cause of carelessness that will cause careless beings to be born among hell beings in the unwholesome lower realms when their bodies disintegrate. {{page:{number:1072,id:UT22084-068-021-101099,folio:F.300.b,volume:V69}}} Saumya, what is this cause of carelessness? It is obsessively gaping at goddesses. Experiencing pleasure by looking at improper forms, one becomes mentally restless and develops thoughts. Those who indulge in meaningless chatter also entertain such thoughts. They do not adopt wholesome forms of behavior in body, speech, or mind. When their bodies disintegrate, they will be born among hell beings in the unwholesome lower realms. This is the fourth cause of carelessness.

Those who enjoy groves, pools, forests, parks, or lotus ponds experience immense pleasure at the sight of them, and they folic and enjoy themselves gleefully in such settings. They never think about virtue, and they never develop mindful composure. Instead, they are governed by carelessness and thus, when their bodies disintegrate, they will be born among hell beings in the unwholesome lower realms.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1953,id:UT22084-068-021-4519}}} “ ‘ “Saumya, this fifth cause of carelessness consists in following unwholesome friends.

Such beings will not undertake wholesome physical activities. Their minds are unstable, restless, and they cannot engage in any single action decisively. Every single physical action they undertake is undercut by their indolence. All their mundane and supramundane aims will therefore be undermined. {{page:{number:1073,id:UT22084-068-021-101100,folio:F.301.a,volume:V69}}} They do not practice generosity, they do not accumulate merit, and they do not keep in mind what they should.

Beings who adopt such a careless mindset will remain careless and distracted, and when their bodies disintegrate, they will be born among hell beings in the unwholesome lower realms. This is the sixth cause of carelessness.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.1956,id:UT22084-068-021-4522}}} “ ‘ “The seventh cause of carelessness occurs when careless beings continually crave delicious food and therefore become hostage to this craving. Such beings are attached to delicious tastes, and their minds always crave them. As they develop that habit, it becomes their nature. Such beings do not have anything else in mind, and they do not adopt any wholesome forms of behavior. They are agitated by nature and unrestrained. Those who are duped in this way by their craving for delicious food do not, even for a single moment, engage in wholesome activity such as contemplating impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and selflessness. They do not act in ways that benefit themselves. When their bodies disintegrate, Saumya, they will be born among hell beings in the unwholesome lower realms.

As a consequence, they do not adopt wholesome forms of behavior in body, speech, or mind. They do not understand the difference between what is appropriate and what is not. {{page:{number:1074,id:UT22084-068-021-101101,folio:F.301.b,volume:V69}}} They lack the distinction between Dharma and non-Dharma and thus, governed by that suffering, they do not engage their minds properly. They never think about the fact that they will themselves have to experience many thoughts of suffering during their hundreds of thousands of lives among hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. Inert like a block of wood, they do not pursue any methods to ward off the Lord of Death. Strongly attached to those unwholesome forms of pleasure that undermine all beings in cyclic existence, they will, when the time has come for them to meet the Lord of Death, be consumed by the fire of regret that will be ignited as a consequence of their attachment to those negative enjoyments.

They do not feel any inclination to do so. They do not listen to their words and do not follow them by becoming disciples of noble beings. They do not understand the difference between what is appropriate and what is not, they do not proclaim that difference, and they do not practice the teachings, but instead they teach worldly people that which is the most terrifying of all. They are not aware of the suffering of decline. Those beings undermine their own well-being, fooled by their own minds.

Experiencing their individual shares of the consequences of their own actions, beings cycle through the realms of cyclic existence, caught by the lasso of their wholesome and unwholesome actions.

Why is that so? Because your life force, enjoyments, and lifespan are all impermanent; therefore, you should not fix your attention on things and you should not live carelessly! Carelessness causes hundreds of thousands of gods to fall into the lower realms, so you should not go along with your carelessness! It is the path of fools, not the path of holy beings.

If even the youthful goddesses in the choirs of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three are incredibly beautiful, why even mention the beauty of the goddesses within the Heaven Free from Strife, who are born from qualities that are three times greater in terms of their associated virtuous and perfectly pure actions. In terms of their appearance, youth, proportions, and the ease with which they play their instruments, these goddesses are as far superior to those of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three as the latter goddesses are to human songstresses. Likewise, the forests, groves, lotus nectars, waterfalls, mansions, pools, and palaces in this realm are increasingly superior. The appearance, youthfulness, and joys associated with the goddesses also become greater, all the way up to the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations. Why is that?

This is why the shortcomings of such realms—such as impermanence, transience, and how all agreeable factors will be lost— must be explained. If it wasn’t, even a slight cause of craving for existence would become an obstacle for virtuous qualities to appear. Whether one looks above, below, or ahead, there is nowhere that is permanent, durable, or stable.

Hearts swelling with tremendous happiness, they will thus proceed in leisurely fashion to their destination.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2042,id:UT22084-068-021-4630}}}“Meanwhile, at his residence King Musulundha sports joyfully within a retinue of a hundred thousand gods, {{page:{number:1099,id:UT22084-068-021-101127,folio:F.8.a,volume:V70}}} aglow with splendor in the midst of hundreds of lotuses and plentiful divine maidens. His form and attire are unrivaled, and he radiates joy and youth, shining indescribably with qualities of perfect glory. His light outshines all the other gods, just as the sun outshines all the planets, stars, and other celestial bodies.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2043,id:UT22084-068-021-4631}}}“The king of the Heaven Free from Strife sits upon a magnificent and excellent lion throne made of the seven precious substances. Endowed with supreme splendor, it is soft to the touch and projects limitless light. Thus he sits, displaying the most wondrous form, attire, and splendor. In front of him the most amazing singing, drumming, and entertainment are performed, inspiring to the heart and ears. The whole place overflows with such rich sense pleasures that there is nothing like it anywhere. The splendors of Śakra cannot match even a fraction of Musulundha’s splendors. Whereas Musulundha’s body shines with five hundred royal lights, Śakra’s shoulders only shine with two supreme lights. The former’s six sense faculties are the result of infinite past actions and virtuous qualities that produce great fortune, and thus he surpasses Śakra hundreds of times. Hence, Śakra cannot serve as an analogy here. Musulundha’s appearance, pleasures, land, and retinue are all peerless. None of the gods of inferior splendor—not even Śakra—can compare in the slightest. Musulundha is a mountain of light, perfectly pure both within and without. No matter what analogy one uses to illustrate him, it falls short. {{page:{number:1100,id:UT22084-068-021-101128,folio:F.8.b,volume:V70}}}

In fact, it is not even comparable to a hundred thousandth of it. Musulundha, lord of gods, must surely have undertaken supremely virtuous actions. If his splendor is so overwhelming, then what can one say of the perfect splendor and appearance of the one I’ve heard of, he who is known as Praśānta? Indeed, the actions undertaken by the gods are increasingly outstanding.’
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2045,id:UT22084-068-021-4633}}}“Having come to this conclusion, he will listen leisurely to the singing, drumming, and music.

They sing, charm, laugh, and serve, surrounded by countless numbers of other goddesses. With great attention, they delight Musulundha with pleasures from near and far, and they offer him nectar to drink. Filled with passion, they all pursue the same objective, thinking, ‘I alone shall give Musulundha pleasures; no one else can do so. Without anyone interfering, I alone shall make him feel at ease. {{page:{number:1101,id:UT22084-068-021-101129,folio:F.9.a,volume:V70}}} I must make love to Musulundha in ways that far surpass those of ordinary sexual union, and that are suitable only here in the Heaven Free from Strife.’ Thinking in this way, the divine maidens approach him. Each of the goddesses thinks, ‘I alone must please him in all regards. I must delight the lord in any way I can. Musulundha and I shall be happy together—and not anyone else. I alone must be dear to him—no one else shall delight him. How can I have sexual intercourse with Musulundha in a way that it is considered an appropriate way to make love here in the Heaven Free from Strife?’ Thus, they all approach Musulundha with this motivation in mind, thinking, ‘I shall please him in any way I can. Indeed, I must be the one to experience all manner of shared pleasures together with the god.’
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2047,id:UT22084-068-021-4635}}} “Once again, the newly born god will approach the place where the divine ruler Musulundha resides. When he draws very close to Musulundha, he will behold him—exceedingly luminous and splendid in the midst of many hundreds of thousands of gods, who delight him with all manner of praises. For his part, Musulundha is aware of all the gods, including the newly born god. On some rare occasions, Musulundha will even cast a glance at the newly born god so as to acknowledge him. The other gods will then encourage the newly born god in pleasant words, saying, ‘He who now has placed his gaze upon you is king of the gods. Therefore, you must now properly prostrate yourself before him.’

In acknowledgement, Musulundha will tell him, ‘Newly born lord, enter among the gods of the Heaven Free from Strife and you will see that the gods here are joyous, exceedingly overjoyed indeed! They are born here due to accumulations of virtuous actions. That is how they have come to such happiness, and that is why they now enjoy the effects of their own previous actions.

There are gardens of numerous colors and shapes, lotus ponds and pools, forests and groves, and many kinds of birds, waterfalls, and mountain peaks formed from the seven precious substances. Such are the many features of Palanquin Houses. Moreover, the positive karmic actions of these gods ensure that whenever they might think, ‘I wish that Palanquin Houses with all its forests, groves, and ponds would rise up into the sky,’ that will indeed happen.

How can factors of unsurpassable virtue be employed to benefit both myself and others? How may I be free from obstacles? The supreme friend of the gods is the one who makes them reach liberation. The one who teaches them unvirtuous actions is, on the other hand, their enemy, for he is the circumstance for their engaging in the type of action that creates the hells.’
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2073,id:UT22084-068-021-4666}}}“So that he may counsel the gods in his realm, Musulundha will then travel toward the site of Palanquin Houses, using a special, miraculous palace for his journey. All the abundance and joys of the rivers, ponds, trees, cascades, forests, and groves in Moving in the Stream cannot match a hundredth, or even a thousandth, of the qualities of this miraculous palace, because Musulundha is the lord of all those who have accomplished positive actions. Among all the gods who have engaged in positive actions within the Heaven Free from Strife, he is the foremost, the master of positive activity. The positive deeds performed by him are vastly superior, as are his miraculous abilities. Therefore, based on such causes, Musulundha’s house appears splendidly bright and radiant, outshining all the palaces of the Heaven Free from Strife. {{page:{number:1108,id:UT22084-068-021-101136,folio:F.12.b,volume:V70}}} Just as no chariot is comparable or beautiful before the sun, so none of the other mansions can compare to Musulundha’s.

When the gods in this realm witness the arrival of the lord of the Heaven Free from Strife, their liking for carelessness is diminished. The gods who otherwise wander carelessly and thoughtlessly will now quickly enter their houses and thus come forth to receive the king of the Heaven Free from Strife. At this point, however, Musulundha will intensify his miraculous powers a hundred thousand times, and thus the gods inside their houses become unable to see anything at all. Unable see anything around them, they remain confounded in their houses. In this way, the great god uses his miraculous powers to prevent them from seeing each other. Nor can they hear any form of joking, flirtation, or joyous games. In this way, his miraculous powers will render them blinded and stunned, and at this point, sitting inside their houses, they will wonder, ‘What has happened to those gods who were sitting right next to me here in this palace? Where has everyone gone?’

Therefore, they are born among hell beings, starving spirits, animals, or humans. Moreover, anyone who is careless and lives carelessly will sooner or later be destroyed by his or her own carelessness. Their craving for objects will ruin them. Those who are thoroughly attached to the five sense pleasures—people who are lost in the play of thought—will see the five peaks of existence ablaze, kindled by the tinder of their minds and fanned by the winds of karmic action. Then, as they have accumulated such factors in the realms of the Heaven Free from Strife, they will later be burned in the painful fires of the hells. Deceived and destroyed by their own unwholesome minds, they are born in the hells once their bodies disintegrate. Carelessness is in this way the most severe among all flaws. Impaired by the flaws of carelessness, the gods fail to see any virtuous factors, and therefore they do not train themselves by means of a wholesome mind.

All the many thoughts that arise from the five sense pleasures—all the dancing, laughing, posing, and celebrating, and all the boundless enjoyments of the forests and parks—all such pleasures are like poisonous friends that now become hurtful enemies. At that time, they will be the cause of terrible regrets.

Careless, I have remained absentminded and I have not practiced anything worthwhile. Now, all my people, all my friends, have left me alone, while they are still celebrating. Now I must leave behind all the delightful objects here in our divine world.”

And when he shows up, none of the divine women can offer any protection. Without giving any thought to those facts, the gods are constantly on the move, yet whenever their pleasures are examined, they are seen to be fake, false, and hollow. Hence, once the gods are destroyed by carelessness, they will be born among the hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. Moreover, conquered by their own stupidity, the gods have not been destroyed by death, transmigration, and the pain of birth just once. They have been so continuously, since time without beginning, {{page:{number:1115,id:UT22084-068-021-101143,folio:F.16.a,volume:V70}}} and yet, lacking intelligence, they do not become any less desirous.’

Crazed, they will continue to celebrate together, enjoying themselves in the forests, groves, ponds, parks, and jungles. Without considering the terrors of the Lord of Death, they will enjoy themselves and play, frolicking in lotus grove after lotus grove, and moving from one mountaintop to the next. Sharing a mutual infatuation, they will continue in this way until finally their acts with desirable, attractive, and delightful consequences have been exhausted.

Becoming kings, or something similarly exceptional, they will remain free from harm, and their companions, friends, and family will always show them affection. They will enjoy themselves together with people who always speak truthfully and have candid and joyous minds, and thus they will maintain their honest conduct without any decline.

The Gods in Living on the Peak
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2116,id:UT22084-068-021-4711}}}“As the monk who has knowledge of the ripening of karmic actions continues to examine the realms of the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife, he applies insight derived from hearing and so correctly perceives a realm known as Living on the Peak. Wondering what karmic actions may cause beings to take birth there, he sees with insight derived from hearing. He then notices how certain holy people who remain constantly concerned about the effects of karmic actions are also honest and sincere. They possess the correct view and pursue correct activities. They completely relinquish unwholesome company and always recollect the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha. Fearful of even the slightest misdeed, they relinquish killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. When on the road, such people may come across women who dance and sing, or they may hear the sounds of their jewelry or voices. At that point they may give rise to incorrect mental activity and become attracted, but they will nevertheless recognize the flaws of such an inappropriate state of mind and completely refrain from any further such thinking. {{page:{number:1118,id:UT22084-068-021-101146,folio:F.17.b,volume:V70}}} Those who thus completely give up sexual misconduct will upon the disintegration of their bodies go to the joyous higher realms and be born among the gods in Living on the Peak.

The mountain is also full of supreme enjoyments, such as flocks of birds that frolic there with gracefully moving feet.{{note:{index:361,id:UT22084-068-021-4713}}} Displaying many different behaviors, plumages, and appearances, the birds number in the hundreds of thousands and present the most delightful spectacle.

The mountain is adorned with wish-fulfilling trees and measures three hundred leagues in circumference. The mountain is home to gorgeous and captivating heavenly beings—groups of gods and goddesses fill the surroundings.

{{milestone:{label:4.C.2232,id:UT22084-068-021-4842}}}“Even those among the gods with the least possessions are nevertheless followed by ten thousand goddesses, who remain constantly devoted to pleasure, always and insatiably indulging in the enjoyments of the senses as they sport with their seductive charms. The minds of the goddesses are filled with desire in hundreds of thousands of ways. You may wonder what causes and conditions give rise to such supremely gratifying women. Likewise, you may wonder why the vast majority of the inhabitants of the higher realms are female, and why males are few by comparison. There are reasons for this. Those born into the world of the higher realms possess desires to a very strong or a medium degree, whereas their anger is at a medium or a lesser level. In the intermediate state prior to their birth into the god realms, beings will perceive eminently desirable females. This sight will greatly intensify their desire and, as a result, most of them will become female. {{page:{number:1140,id:UT22084-068-021-101168,folio:F.28.b,volume:V70}}} It is because of their attachment to pleasure that these beings in the intermediate state assume a female form. This is the reason that females, and not males, predominate in the heavens.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2233,id:UT22084-068-021-4843}}}“Some gods have ten thousand such goddesses while others have twenty thousand, thirty thousand, forty thousand, fifty thousand, sixty thousand, and so forth, up to a hundred thousand, and most gods have even more than that. Those who indulge their desires with such ladies are born insatiable. Concerning the process of sexual union, in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, it is the same as among humans. In the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, the gods have intercourse just as humans do. In the Heaven Free from Strife, they rely just on touch. In the Heaven of Joy, speaking is the medium. In the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, the gods simply gaze at one another, and the gods in the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations insatiably smell aromas or listen to words that they perceive from a distance.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2234,id:UT22084-068-021-4844}}}“Throughout all this, every single god remains in harmony with all the goddesses. Everyone is of one mind, and they all find each other attractive. The bodies of the gods are utterly free from flesh, bones, and worms. The gods are neither long nor short, and all of them are powerful. Their strength never wanes, they are capable of subduing others, and they possess tremendous splendor. In this way, a single god can remain in accord with many hundred thousand goddesses. Filled with a lustrous splendor, the gods move gracefully, and their hearts are extremely joyous. In this way they enter the heavens, going and coming as they please. As they enjoy themselves with one after another supreme goddess of the heavens, they relish such pleasures. {{page:{number:1141,id:UT22084-068-021-101169,folio:F.29.a,volume:V70}}} Enjoying their partners and the sensual pleasures, they joyfully revel as they please. In this way, by means of a great variety of features, they experience the higher realms. Spending an exceptionally long time on the level of Living on the Peak within the Heaven Free from Strife, they enjoy the pleasures of the five senses in conformity with their own previous karma.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2235,id:UT22084-068-021-4845}}}“As the clusters of gods and goddesses roam about in this way,{{note:{index:372,id:UT22084-068-021-4846}}} they gradually proceed to the forest called Shaken by Fierce Winds, where they will playfully pursue their enjoyments for as long as their past karma permits. When no such karma remains, their retinue of goddesses will abandon them. When the goddesses leave the gods, the following signs in the form of fatal disease will appear. First, whenever they approach an open lotus, it will close. That is the first omen. Another sign of death and transmigration is that whenever they go to a lotus pond or a cluster of trees, all the bees will leave that location. That is the second sign. The third sign is that when they frolic with the goddesses, the latter’s music will make their lust wane. The fourth sign is that whenever they go near a tree, its flowers will wither. The fifth is that when they go sightseeing through the gardens in their chariots, they will be unable to rise into the sky. Those signs pertain to the gods of the Heaven Free from Strife. There are also the signs witnessed by the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, such as profuse sweating from the armpits, and the like. {{page:{number:1142,id:UT22084-068-021-101170,folio:F.29.b,volume:V70}}} Those are signs of certain death and transmigration due to the exhaustion of virtuous actions. They are followed by death conditioned by unvirtuous factors.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2236,id:UT22084-068-021-4847}}}“There are also twelve great signs that, as they arise, gradually foretoken death. When a god who possesses previous causes is about to die and transmigrate to a human existence, the light that shines from his body and accompanies him will begin to dim, as when the sun is setting. Likewise, when a god’s flower garlands and fruits begin to decay, that is an indication of impending death. Another sign of death is that the flowers that the god attaches to his hair begin to wither. A further sign of death is that when the god takes a bath, his body’s reflection in the water will appear the way he is about to be reborn—be it as a hell being, starving spirit, animal, or human. After those signs comes a fifth omen, which is that, upon seeing his reflection on the water, the god will be terrified and his body hairs will stand on end, as if they were thorns. At that moment, another sign of death and transmigration will manifest in the form of environmental changes. Thus, whether the god has been sitting upon a seat of beryl, silver, gold, or sapphire, the seat now transforms and turns into copper. Another sign of death and transmigration is that the wind will ruffle the god’s clothing. The ground will feel hot and he will have to get up from his seat, feeling as if a vajra had struck him. {{page:{number:1143,id:UT22084-068-021-101171,folio:F.30.a,volume:V70}}} These signs will cause the god’s state of mind to change. As his state of mind is transformed, the sounds, textures, tastes, sights, and smells that he perceives become unpleasant. Thus, the god draws closer to the fire of impermanence.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2237,id:UT22084-068-021-4848}}}“The next signs of death and transmigration manifest conjointly. He will no longer see things as other than they actually are, such as stones which are the nature of beryl. He will also witness a complete fall in his standing.{{note:{index:373,id:UT22084-068-021-4849}}} After that, the women will soon understand from those signs that the god is about to die and will therefore abandon him. They will also begin to speak badly of him, which causes him tremendous torment. The pain produced by this loss of his companions is so severe that none of his other enjoyments can match even a sixteenth of that.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2238,id:UT22084-068-021-4850}}}“Next follows the onset of a tenth sign as the god’s faculties degenerate. He will begin to appear with rolling eyes, and so forth. Next comes an eleventh sign of death as his mind, like a water wheel, becomes incapable of staying still. Perceiving the pain of death and transmigration, his mind becomes highly unstable. Thereafter, the faculty of his life force will come to an end. The god witnesses this as akin to when the light of a candle dims and extinguishes once its wick is burned and its fuel is used up. Although he has not yet died or transmigrated, he will now perceive the trees he used to enjoy as if scorched by fire, and the birds that live in them will leave and go elsewhere. Nevertheless, others will still perceive all the former qualities. {{page:{number:1144,id:UT22084-068-021-101172,folio:F.30.b,volume:V70}}}

From there, the gods inside the water lily can watch how other gods frolic and enjoy themselves within the forests and parks, enjoying pleasures in accordance with their own karmic actions. By the power of their incomparably immaculate discipline, those who have entered the water lily are able to enjoy numerous such heavenly features together with King Musulundha.

Another such sign is that the colors of their fine seats will fade, and whether they were made of gold, beryl, or sapphire, they will now turn into wood. Yet another sign of imminent death is that they will misperceive those ponds that have just manifested.

They pay attention to the body. They delight in keeping their minds well guarded and enjoy examining the elements, sense sources, and aggregates. They have no fondness for gatherings or groups and do not become entangled in their society for even half a day. They do not associate with people who are deceptive or aggressive, and they do not keep a household. They are not inclined to go to town or frequent cities, highways, or intersections. They do not pursue meetings with friends or companions and aim to keep them brief. They are diligent and pursue knowledge and understanding with constant endeavor.

Thus, as the effects of their previously explained virtuous actions, they will fully enjoy themselves in myriad ways among these mountains. As effects of their positive actions, they will become supremely powerful and splendid, and while they enjoy themselves in this way, they will behold the five great wonders of those mountains.

They will explain that careless beings will encounter the terror of losing what is agreeable and beautiful, the terror of being separated from their companions, and the four terrors. They will explain these matters free from desire, without any wish for respect, and without being influenced by conceit or arrogance. Free from such factors, they will teach the words of the buddhas. They will only explain a portion of the buddhas’ teaching at this point, however, for they fear that their learning is insufficient, since they have not elsewhere received further teachings or illustrative examples. Also, worrying that it might take too long, they will provide no other reasoning or examples. Yet, in the future, they will transmit what was not yet heard.

The foremost among them is called Sole Shadow, which is a forest in which there are no shadows. Also, the Sole Shadow forest is made of the most delightful beryl. The ground there gives way to one’s step and bounces back when the foot is lifted. Birds sing and the forest has hundreds of lotus groves, cascades, ponds, and pools. There, the happy gods enjoy themselves in numerous ways.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2405,id:UT22084-068-021-5033}}}“Sole Shadow contains five great pools that are home to exquisite swans, ducks, and geese. The infatuated birds produce calls in many enrapturing ways, thus filling the environment with their tunes. Numerous aquatic flowers emerge from the water, yet they are never sullied by mud stirred up by the wind that ripples the surface of the water. Within the lotuses and other flowers that grow in those pristine ponds, the gods befriend each other as they enjoy themselves and celebrate. There are five ponds there, known as Delightful to Behold, Water That One Never Tires Of, Joyous Birds, Constant Happiness, and Joyful Gods. Hundreds of thousands of bright bees in many shapes and colors flit about there, producing a sonorous humming as they sip the flower nectars with an intense fervor for their taste. Hearing the buzzing of the bees makes the gods ecstatic, and when they see the bees they will rush forward. The ponds are filled with extremely clear water, and their colors, shapes, and aromas are all gorgeous. When the gods behold the ponds, they will enter them one after the other and play with each other in the waters. {{page:{number:1181,id:UT22084-068-021-101209,folio:F.49.a,volume:V70}}} Relishing these most perfect sense pleasures, they will joyfully frolic among the many enjoyments.

In this way, numerous sounds and words mingle, and joyous words and sounds ring out in a magnificent stream. The sounds of the exuberant gods blend with the singing of the birds, and the myriad sounds made by nāgas also join the mix. This produces an entrancing symphony that captivates the attention of the gods who reside on other mountains, so that they can no longer focus on their own enjoyment of supreme and superb pleasures. Likewise, when the deer and birds that live in other locations hear these enrapturing tunes, they stop eating their rich and delicious foods. Without moving their eyes or ears, they now listen to the symphony of bird song and sounds produced by the nāgas. They keep relishing, again and again, the unusual and enchanting sounds of the nāgas, tones that are so delightful that even gods who live elsewhere become inspired.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2407,id:UT22084-068-021-5035}}}“When the gods in Continuous Movement have enjoyed the pleasures at these five delightful ponds for a very long time, they will proceed to Enjoyment of Drinks, a forest that abounds with drink, in order to enjoy themselves there. In pursuit of beverages and an inspiring place to hang out, they gradually turn up there. {{page:{number:1182,id:UT22084-068-021-101210,folio:F.49.b,volume:V70}}} Upon arrival, they will, by the power of their positive actions, immerse themselves in the pristine waters of a fathomless river. This river flows with ambrosias that have sublime fragrance, taste, and color. The aromas of the river can be sensed across five leagues{{note:{index:383,id:UT22084-068-021-5036}}}—they gather and spread across the full five leagues.{{note:{index:384,id:UT22084-068-021-5037}}} The waters in the river manifest in accordance with whatever drinks the gods may wish for. Ruled by their desirous minds, the gods participate in the most terrifying games of pleasure. People who roam about in search of pleasure feel their enjoyments increase when their minds can pursue such pleasures, even if they no longer have a home. What then to think of those who enjoy free access to whatever they like while music from the five types of instruments is playing?
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2408,id:UT22084-068-021-5038}}}“The frolicking gods enjoy beverages that are completely free of any negative side effects. What they drink is perfectly agreeable and endowed with the most exquisite aromas. The joy that they feel is therefore indescribable. Traipsing around joyfully, they drink nectars and enjoy each other’s company for a long time. Since their minds have been involved in tenacious craving since beginningless time, this is what they continue to cultivate.

Endowed with perfect miraculous powers, they will assemble to the accompaniment of music of the five types of instruments resounding throughout all directions, and even the sublime aromas will increase. Outmatching the stars, their playful bodies gather in the midst of the sky. Then, through their mastery of miraculous powers, which they have obtained due to their past positive actions, they will journey to their destination, the backside of the mountains. There, they will find large and small bells, waterfalls, streams, ponds, groves, embankments, flowers, the most delightful singing of birds, and divine substances with delectable fragrances. When they have thus toured the bright and harmonious environment of the mountains’ backside, they will once again congregate in the sky.

Such differences are due to differences in their karmic backgrounds. Thus, these groups of gods who celebrate together are of various sizes, some containing one thousand, others two thousand, still others three thousand, and so forth, up to twenty thousand assembled gods. Joyfully participating in various dances, playing drums, and singing songs, they will roam from forest to forest. Visiting one nectar-producing lotus grove after the other, they wind their way through the nectar-laden groves to the sound of music of the five types of instruments.

All the stones there are gems {{page:{number:1184,id:UT22084-068-021-101212,folio:F.50.b,volume:V70}}} and the ground is strikingly colorful, much more resplendent than the sun. It yields to the step and bounces back again when the foot is lifted, as if it were made of the perfectly soft cotton that is produced in Gonakī in Jambudvīpa, or as if it had been supplied with soft padding, or made of some other soft substance so that it is always soft whether a foot is placed on it or not. On the backside of the mountains every single precious stone, all of the ground itself, as well as all the branches of the trees, the mountain summits, the lotuses, and the jewels, are without exception incredibly soft and delightful to touch. Everything is enchanting to behold, and therefore the joy of the gods is as rich as the land. Having gone to the backside of those beautiful mountains, the gods enjoy themselves and celebrate.

Unable to bear the light, other gods will hide among the trees. Some will take cover together with their companions within the jewel caves. Those among the gods who are particularly bold will muster courage and gather to take in the wonder they are witnessing. Without letting themselves become intimidated, they will keep watching, wondering, ‘What is this? Where does this light come from? It shines so wonderfully on the backside of this mountain—what a precious, blazing light!’

The bright shining light shimmers as it descends through the sky. Watching this downward-streaming light, the gods will wonder, ‘How far might this light reach?’ and they will begin discussing their various estimates. Meanwhile, the blazing and dazzling light will descend five thousand leagues through the sky of the Heaven Free from Strife. It is so brilliant that its radiance defies measurement. As it approaches, the light is so strong that even the boldest among the gods will be unable to watch and must close their eyes. This is because the brilliance is so overwhelming that their eyes cannot take it in, and hence they must cover them.

Now free from fear, they will talk about the amazing thing that has occurred, wondering, ‘What was that astonishing light that so frightened us?’ In this way, they will try for a long time to figure out what that astonishing occurrence might have been. At first, they are amazed and discuss what this wonder might have been. Then, after thinking about it for a long while, they become afraid for a moment.

Among them are throngs of goddesses with hundreds of thousands of special features, ornaments, costumes, shapes, and qualities.

This is very surprising to the gods, and some of them will be so terrified that they will run to the ruler of the gods in panic. Others will look into the center of the sky and see it as an omen of great portent. Those among the gods who are free from carelessness, such as Musulundha, and who have heard about the import of the descending light and therefore understand what is happening, will reverently pay homage to the Buddha. Others who have poor strength of heart and whose steadfastness has crumbled will take cover in the caves and the dense forests. Still others will run to the ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife, looking for protection. Since the gods understand that Musulundha knows about such supreme wonders and amazing events, they will all request him, ‘Please explain to us gods the nature of this bright light that descends through the sky. Please make us gods properly understand what this descending light is.’ In this way the gods will request their ruler to explain this matter that they do not understand. They will say, ‘We do not understand this. Divine ruler, please explain what it is. We do not understand what we are witnessing, so please explain it to us.’

Above us towers a palace of bodhisattvas into which are born those humans who observe the pure fivefold discipline in a way that is flawless, unbroken, undefiled, steadfast, and genuine. Upon the disintegration of their bodies, such humans go to the joyous higher realms and take birth among the gods in that Heaven of Joy. Their amusements, joys, parks, goddesses, radiance, and bodies; their splendor, intelligence, and longevity; and their many enjoyments, physical and mental pleasures, and the appearance of their goddesses are all such that our own cannot even match a sixteenth of them. We inhabitants of the Heaven Free from Strife cannot even find a way to express their splendor. Compared to them, we do not even possess the splendor of a firefly. The same goes for our enjoyments—they are only remotely similar. Their long-lasting abundant delights, their heavenly happiness, and their perfect sense pleasures are all utterly beyond us gods here in the Heaven Free from Strife. {{page:{number:1190,id:UT22084-068-021-101218,folio:F.53.b,volume:V70}}}

All sentient beings are certain to experience the impermanence of enjoyments, age, and consciousness. By the force of impermanence, their lives will run out and their positive actions will become exhausted. When reaching the time for death and transmigration those gods will fall from their divine kind in the Heaven of Joy. Their karmic formations of becoming are like various kinds of firewood combined with water,{{note:{index:385,id:UT22084-068-021-5054}}} yet the factors of formation that determine where they will be born cannot be demolished by any force within the three realms. If they were inexhaustible and endless, they would live on forever, yet no sentient being can be seen in such a situation because destruction is the essence of all conditioned things. Since all beings must eventually fall, those gods will also fall from the Heaven of Joy. Upon the exhaustion of their past positive karmic actions, they will die and transmigrate. The wind of time brings gloom around the lamp when its oil and wick are exhausted. Just as the disintegration of the features of a seed are followed by the growth of the sprout, so death and transmigration will follow the exhaustion of that life during which karmic actions had remained hidden. What you saw is the light of those falling beings. The light comes from their disintegrating bodies, their corpses that are the result of the exhaustion of their karmic actions. This supremely dazzling light appears due to a particular kind of karmic action. It is an exceptionally vast karmic effect of dying, a manifestation of virtue. Such is the nature of this light. {{page:{number:1191,id:UT22084-068-021-101219,folio:F.54.a,volume:V70}}}

Still others will, upon hearing these words that are free from deception, once more actively pursue their objects. Thus, they will enjoy themselves within forests, parks, and groves; by waterfalls and ponds; among creepers and trees; in delightful locations made of precious substances where many birds sing enchantingly; and at sites adorned by hundreds of lotus pools and by the seven precious substances. In this way, on the delightful backside of these mountains where numerous singers perform beautiful songs, they will experience a variety of sounds, textures, tastes, forms, and scents. Together with their retinues, those who thus crave objects will fail to observe what is supreme.

Some of them will feel weary. And so, they will enjoy themselves in a variety of ways, with various perspectives, and with a variety of objects. The gods in this realm will therefore continue to have fun and celebrate until finally their desirable, attractive, and delightful actions have become exhausted, decomposed, and decayed. Once that happens, these gods, who are insatiable in their enjoyment of various objects, will die and transmigrate. At that point, they are in the noose of karmic actions, and thus they will be pulled into the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, or animals.

They always guard their senses and they are fearful of the objects that populate cyclic existence. They have clear awareness of the suffering of separation, just as they fully comprehend the sufferings of birth, aging, death, encountering what is undesirable, and lacking the desirable. They understand the flaws of the five appropriated aggregates. They always practice virtuous actions zealously and give up unwholesome company.

They will not associate with women, even in their dreams. During the day they will not develop any attachment, and their minds will not become captivated or focus incorrectly.

{{milestone:{label:4.C.2446,id:UT22084-068-021-5082}}}“When a drunkard who has fallen asleep is suddenly woken up late at night, he does not at first know who or where he is. Only when he has come to his senses will the drunkard understand. In the same way, the newborn god will puzzle over this for a very long time before he finally realizes that he was previously a human being, but then died, transmigrated, and was reborn there. His mind is now unlike how it was when he was a human. The mind that formerly was conditioned for human life is now here in this divine world, where it craves sense objects. Since the mind is now conditioned in this way, it hankers for the pleasures of the divine world. Understanding that his mind has been conditioned over an extremely long period, the god will finally conclude that he was born in this divine world due to positive actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2447,id:UT22084-068-021-5083}}}“He will also see that upon dying and transmigrating from the Heaven Free from Strife, he will not be born as a god, for such is the nature of that state. If, after death and transmigration from this divine state, he should next be born as a human, his nature will be of a similar kind as before, because his mind has been so conditioned. Likewise, when someone dies and transmigrates from a human condition, his nature will be similar to what it was before, since his mind is still conditioned in that way. Thus, as a god, the experience will be similar, since his nature is the outflow of his mind. However, if someone dies in hell and transmigrates to become a god, {{page:{number:1198,id:UT22084-068-021-101226,folio:F.57.b,volume:V70}}} this is due to karmic powers to be experienced in the next life, after hell. Even small measures of such actions by a hell being will have results to be experienced in other lives. Thus, when a being in hell engages in just a slight measure of holy conduct, it will lead to birth in the heavens in other lives. Once born there, his previous experience of suffering will cause him to respond to the perception of pleasures with an especially strong yearning that resembles suffering. He will also be unusually wrathful, and he will want to stay in the coolest forests, parks, waterfalls, and ponds. He will move restlessly and experience food with a special fervor. Such are the effects of the conditioning of his mind.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2448,id:UT22084-068-021-5084}}}“When a starving spirit dies and transmigrates to a divine state his numerous former activities will have created strong conditioning that will cause him to experience food and drink with special passion. Such a god will also always be fond of cool places, and he will indulge avidly in the company of women, for such is the way that his mind has been conditioned with karmic imprints.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2449,id:UT22084-068-021-5085}}}“Alternatively, if, due to karmic actions to be experienced in other lives, an animal dies and is reborn among the gods, it will be inclined toward the enjoyment of drink and food. Since many kinds of animals may take rebirth as gods, the characters of their subsequent lives as gods also differ, but, in short, they shall experience varying degrees of perfection when it comes to their food. Such gods are also subject to especially powerful delusions about their pleasures because that is the way their minds have been conditioned.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2450,id:UT22084-068-021-5086}}}“In cases when a god dies and is reborn as a god, such a being may, for example, die after having achieved the attainments of the four formless realms. In the subsequent divine existence, the conditioning of his mind will ensure {{page:{number:1199,id:UT22084-068-021-101227,folio:F.58.a,volume:V70}}} that the god does not become distracted by the experience of desirable sounds, textures, tastes, forms, or smells. That is an effect of his former conditioning. If a being practices one of the four concentrations of the form realm and subsequently is born among the gods in the realm of desire, the quality of his mind and his interest in concentration will correspond to his previous achievements, and he will be less fond of objects than otherwise might be the case.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2451,id:UT22084-068-021-5087}}}“If gods in the desire realm die and are reborn in the desire realm, it occasionally happens that their subsequent experience is determined by previous virtuous actions within the realms of gods or humans. As a result, they will be reborn as gods due to their wealth of these two types of former actions as well as their proper conduct. This, however, is not the case with the gods in the pure abodes because such gods do not possess any karmic actions to be experienced either in the subsequent or any other future life.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2452,id:UT22084-068-021-5088}}}“In this way, the entire world is blown around by the winds of karmic action. Bound and fettered in such numerous ways, the five classes of beings breed myriad inclinations, thoughts, and lives as they continue wandering. As these matters become evident to the newly born god, he keeps them in mind. With this understanding, he will now comprehend how he died and transmigrated from a previous existence into his present life. Whether he died and transmigrated from a human existence, or whether he was reborn once more as a god, the god will know when the causal karmic action is of the kind that is to be experienced in a subsequent life. But if the causal karmic action is of the kind that is to be experienced in other lives, he will not necessarily recognize it, because such actions may be beyond the scope of his mind. {{page:{number:1200,id:UT22084-068-021-101228,folio:F.58.b,volume:V70}}} In some cases, the conditions that bring to ripening karmic actions to be experienced in other lives may occur only after the passage of hundreds of eons. It is even possible that such ripening occurs only after a hundred thousand eons. Thus, if the cause of the god’s birth occurred a hundred thousand unfathomable eons earlier, his divine eye will not be able to perceive the given causal action.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2453,id:UT22084-068-021-5089}}}“In this way, the god will dwell for some time on the perception of the causes of his birth. Thereafter, the many objects that manifest through his former practice of virtue will become evident, for he now realizes that he has been born among the gods in Moving in Vast Environments. As soon that knowledge dawns on him, due to the force of his virtuous actions, a vast gathering of goddesses will come rushing toward him. Conditioned by the god’s virtues, they call out, ‘He has just been born!’ In this way they will raucously dash toward him from far away.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2454,id:UT22084-068-021-5090}}}“Surrounded by all those divine beings, the newly born god will then enjoy himself within the delightful forests and parks. Endowed with the supreme possessions that his karmic capital has furnished him with, he will now experience amazing pleasures. His realm is filled with mountains, forests, parks, pools, jungles, waterfalls, lotus ponds, slopes, lush groves, caverns, houses covered with vines, and hundreds of thousands of lovely birds that warble enchantingly. Thousands of goddesses who constantly aim to please sing and dance delightfully, doing so in parks that sparkle with the seven precious substances and where live enchanting deer. {{page:{number:1201,id:UT22084-068-021-101229,folio:F.59.a,volume:V70}}} In this realm stands the mountain known as Great Summit, which shines with the light of hundreds of thousands of stones made of the seven precious substances. On the mountain’s radiant jewel summit stand houses festooned with vines, and the ground is beautifully paved with large tiles. There are woods, lotus groves, parks, ponds, cascades, riverbanks, valleys, and peaks endowed with exquisite shapes and qualities. At hundreds of thousands of waterfalls that cascade with cooling drops of water, the gods, whose bodies are formed due to a variety of virtuous actions, enjoy themselves and frolic, experiencing their many pleasures.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2455,id:UT22084-068-021-5091}}}“The gleeful frolicking of those divine gatherings assumes myriad forms. But, in short, those who enjoy the water, and thus joyously play around in it, have for the most part come from the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. They delight in each other with an exceedingly attached state of mind, yet they do not associate with those who practice wholesome conduct. On the bodies of these gods appear scripts that describe the related karmic actions of all the types of gods. They describe how the gods previously engaged in positive karmic actions, what those karmic actions were and how often they performed them, the manner and duration in which they practiced and what the conditions were, what their lives were like then, whether the beneficiaries of their actions were inferior, intermediate, or supreme, and the qualities of the entities involved. All this information, including the timing, is described and listed in writing. As when a shrewd and attentive scribe writes clear and distinct letters, {{page:{number:1202,id:UT22084-068-021-101230,folio:F.59.b,volume:V70}}} the accomplished scribe of the gods will write all their past positive actions upon the present surface of their past positive actions. The gods’ magnificence, their shining beauty, and their enrapturing appearance are all perfect due to their past positive actions. Yet, the splendid writing that conveys their many superior characteristics makes them appear hundreds of times more beautiful. Just as a most splendid and shining piece of gold, which has been purified hundreds of times, can be studded with rubies, sapphires, or some other precious gem of supreme beauty, those gods are, similarly, brilliantly adorned by the accounts that describe the ways they performed their past karmic actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2456,id:UT22084-068-021-5092}}}“Still, the gods do not see what is written on them with their own eyes, because the writing appears on their throats and chests. Nevertheless, they may recognize it upon each other, and at such times their minds will not be utterly careless—at such times they will see everything clearly. This is a supreme wonder of the gods in the realm of Moving in Vast Environments. Another astonishing fact concerning those gods is that just as they have their positive actions displayed on their chests, so they also have writing on their foreheads. Written there in fine lettering is when they will die, where they will transmigrate to, how they will be born, and how long they then will live. That is another wonder of these gods, produced by their karmic actions. The exceptionally elegant rows of bright and beautiful letters are similar to the many garlands of blooming flowers that adorn the gods in other realms. {{page:{number:1203,id:UT22084-068-021-101231,folio:F.60.a,volume:V70}}} This particular adornment is due to their having performed a unique type of past positive action.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2457,id:UT22084-068-021-5093}}}“The gods do not understand the messages written on their bodies due to karmic actions and, consequently, they go on frolicking together in the heavenly parks decked out in their sundry costumes and ornaments. When in this way they have spent a long time enjoying the realm of Moving in Vast Environments, they will promenade to the banks of the river called Colorful Waters, which flows from one mountain to the next, passing among many different kinds of precious substances. Flocks of birds warble, there are dense forests, hundreds of thousands of different flowers bloom, and the banks are visited by coteries of goddesses. An amazing feature of this river that flows from the beautiful mountain peaks, Colorful Waters, is that when its surface becomes still for a long period, those gods who previously died and transmigrated from the hells will, as they approach the river, be prompted to remember their previous lives and the actions that gave rise to that existence. They will recollect how the constant enjoyment of perfect sense pleasures among jubilant gods and goddesses kindles an ever-growing attachment in them, which causes them to engage in further endless pleasures that will eventually lead to suffering. Recollecting this, they will forget all their pleasures and, with sadness, speak the following verses:

Some take a seat within the hearts of the flowers, making their bodies small or large according to their wishes. Seated there, they may then travel a hundred thousand leagues in the wink of an eye, and return just as quickly. They can engage with objects simply by sight, and therefore nothing ever feels cramped. Just as a hundred eyes can look at a single fingertip without crowding it, a hundred or a thousand gods can sit on a single lotus without the flower ever becoming congested.

Due to their positive past actions there is no congestion at all, and so the gods’ own actions allow them to indulge in their games by the splendid lotus pools, celebrating just as they please. Drinking delicious ambrosia, they revel in extremely vast crowds at thousands of locations. They also befriend gods who live elsewhere and who otherwise do not frolic to the same extent. Their bodies, which are free from unwholesomeness, shine brighter than a hundred thousand suns. With bodies suffused with bliss, they relish the many delightful objects while they drink ambrosia. Then eventually, after a very long time, they will once again entertain the wish to see Musulundha.

Upon seeing the sights of the forest, they are struck with wonder. Seeing in accordance with their many unique past actions, they will now behold a rich display that brings them unprecedented joy.

The forest is radiant and resplendent, like a thousand suns, but the light does not burn like the sun. Seeing those resplendent trees, the gods will feel overjoyed. Likewise, as they hear the continuous melodious sounds of that remote forest, they will feel tremendous joy. They will also gain much joy through their noses. In that way, all their five senses are gratified, for the scents of the flowers are fragrant, the divine fruits that they taste with their tongues are delicious, and their physical sensations are blissful, due to the unwoven fabrics they wear. Moreover, their minds are euphoric because their five senses are perfectly satisfied. Relative to their senses, their minds conceive of all the phenomena. As their consciousness thus experiences its objects, they perceive the mandārava forest. They will observe that the whole mandārava forest is filled with joyous gods and goddesses with unparalleled ornaments and costumes, who act with unfathomable grace.

There is no god there who does not follow Musulundha, lord of the Heaven Free from Strife, because the gods are fond of him and they understand that it is their foremost duty to follow him. Riding the mounts that were described before, the gods enjoy the many pleasures of a land that is adorned with gorgeous cascades, rivers, ponds, and lotus groves, as well as a ground that yields to one’s step but bounces back once the foot is lifted. The ground in this forest looks like a bright, golden garment.

Some adorn themselves with beautiful garlands and tiaras made of lotus flowers. In this way, they frolic together and display their stunning ornaments and costumes while aglow in their own natural light. Some gods form joyous circles in the sky. Some play flutes, drums, and various other instruments and go singing on the mountain slopes and in the jungle.

Therefore, listen well. What you behold here are the six beautifully bejeweled stūpas of the six perfect buddhas. The six thus-gone ones for whom they were constructed are the perfect buddha Śikhin, the perfect buddha Vipaśyin, the perfect buddha Kanakamuni, the perfect buddha Viśvabhū, the perfect buddha Krakucchanda, and the perfect buddha Kāśyapa. These reliquaries were built by other gods in the past. We have heard all about them and thus we worship them. However, because our lives are extremely short, we were not able to see any of those thus-gone ones ourselves. Nevertheless, those blessed ones worked for the welfare of the world and were committed to benefiting beings. Therefore, they came to stay in this divine world for the benefit of the gods.

At that time, some images of gods that suffer death and transmigration become perceptible upon this reliquary, but it is only I who perceive these signs of decay. {{page:{number:1245,id:UT22084-068-021-101273,folio:F.81.a,volume:V70}}} The signs do also appear to those who remain absorbed in carelessness despite their degeneration, but they fail to see them because they are so attached to objects. Instead, they continue singing songs among themselves, thinking that such pointless activity will be of benefit. So, beware, you who are reckless and lost in carelessness—you are going to die! Since your positive actions will eventually become exhausted, all of this will indeed come to nothing! These facts are explained in the discourses of those six thus-gone ones, which were given for the benefit of beings. It is the thus-gone ones who caused all of that to be inscribed upon the reliquaries. Therefore, everyone of sound mind, listen to me!

They will also not take care of their loved ones, but treat them as strangers. Meanwhile, their enemies will find such people to be awful, and will therefore watch for the right time to strike and destroy them. Such are the consequences, in terms of mundane behavior, for those who roam about carelessly and thoughtlessly.

Such careless people will always have restless minds. If they enter an assembly or a learned gathering, they will be ridiculed due to their poor intelligence.

They will not attend to their duties, nor will they fulfill the requests of donors and benefactors.

However, whenever a god thinks, “I would like to be near those things over there,” the delightful forms will immediately be present before him. Also, the ambrosias of the gods transform according to their wishes. If they want them to be near, they will come close, and if they want them at a distance, they will move away.

{{milestone:{label:4.C.2865,id:UT22084-068-021-5540}}}“ ‘Corresponding to the quality of their commitment to meaningful discipline, they may take birth among the gods in three different ways. {{page:{number:1290,id:UT22084-068-021-101318,folio:F.103.b,volume:V70}}} There will be differences in terms of how consummate their faith in the buddhas and so forth may be, or what special qualities their minds may possess, how gentle their minds may be, how devoted to the authentic view they may be, what form their wishes may take, how respectful to their parents they may be, how much teaching they may have received, how great their qualities may be, or what the characteristics of their aspirations are. It is due to such differences in their minds, and the way they become inspired by the objects of their faith, that the qualities of their minds are inferior, intermediate, or superior. Therefore, they also take birth in three corresponding ways. These results are unfailingly achieved through meaningful discipline, and they accord with their causal actions. There is, therefore, no need to mention that birth in the Heaven Free from Strife may also be achieved by taking vows and thus becoming destined for the transcendence of suffering.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2866,id:UT22084-068-021-5541}}}“ ‘How many types of discipline associated with vows are there? In short, there are four types of vows, namely, those of a monk, a nun, a male lay practitioner, and a female lay practitioner. In other words, there are the vows of the fourfold retinue. What are their vows, how many are there, and how do they differ?
The Male Lay Practitioner
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2867,id:UT22084-068-021-5543}}}“ ‘Stated concisely, there are four types of male lay practitioner. What are they? Those who act partially, those who act thoroughly, those who act comprehensively, and those who adopt a single vow among the bases of training. Acting thoroughly is when one has taken vows with respect to the bases of training and acts accordingly, or for the most part acts accordingly, thus upholding the bases of training correctly. Acting comprehensively is when one upholds all the five bases of training.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2868,id:UT22084-068-021-5544}}}“ ‘There is also another set of four: {{page:{number:1291,id:UT22084-068-021-101319,folio:F.104.a,volume:V70}}} engaging with the bases of training sequentially, engaging free from any flaw, engaging with remorse, and engaging in a way that is flawed in all respects. A lay practitioner who engages with the bases of training sequentially is someone who journeys through the ocean of the bases of training one at a time. First, such a person becomes a lay practitioner who goes for refuge in the Three Jewels. Later, he develops fine qualities, having cultivated them sequentially. In this manner, he may adhere to a single basis for training in ways that are undamaged, uninterrupted, or free from defilement.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2869,id:UT22084-068-021-5545}}}“ ‘What is meant by undamaged, uninterrupted, or free from defilement? Undamaged observance implies that one follows the training for as long as one is alive and does not even mentally transgress one’s vow. If others do so, one will not condone it but instead try to stop them and establish them in Dharma. That is what is known as undamaged observance.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2870,id:UT22084-068-021-5546}}}“ ‘What then is uninterrupted observance? Here one might in some cases let go of the bases of training but will subsequently take them up again, such that whenever they are relinquished, they will again be resumed. That is what is meant by uninterrupted observance. One avoids interruption by way of resumption.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2871,id:UT22084-068-021-5547}}}“ ‘What is observance free from defilement, and how is defilement to be understood here? It may be the case that one initially embraces the bases of training in a very pure state of mind before a spiritual friend but then later develops regret and fails to observe the vows. As the river of thought carries one away, one is troubled and loses mental strength. Later, one feels the burning fire of regret. That burning will make one give up the training, and, once abandoned, it will not be resumed. That is what is meant by defilement. {{page:{number:1292,id:UT22084-068-021-101320,folio:F.104.b,volume:V70}}} Defilement makes one fail to adhere to the bases of training.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2872,id:UT22084-068-021-5548}}}“ ‘Again, a layperson who engages with the bases of training sequentially may do so in ways that are undamaged, unbroken, or free from defilement. What does undamaged refer to? Although the mind has become free from stains and is virtuous, it may relapse into unwholesomeness. A mind that is impressive like the leaves of a plantain tree or a flash of lightning may be virtuous and observe the vows with purity and respect. However, subsequent exposure to non-Buddhist learning may cause regret and, as the mind becomes disturbed thereby, the bases of training may be abandoned. Later, hearing the sacred Dharma once again can cause one to resume the training. This would be an instance of damage.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2873,id:UT22084-068-021-5549}}}“ ‘When would training be broken? If a lay practitioner observes the vows insincerely, he may begin to worship deities and then ask himself, “I wonder whether the Dharma taught by the buddhas will make me happy, or whether perhaps the words of the gods shall take me to heaven.” When the Dharma is practiced with such doubts in mind, one’s practice is classified as broken.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2874,id:UT22084-068-021-5550}}}“ ‘What does defilement refer to? It refers to when one is empty inside but nevertheless eagerly pretends before others to have a virtuous mind. Also, although one is rotten on the inside, one still adheres to the bases of training for the sake of winning others’ confidence. Such a person is empty inside. Lay practitioners who engage with the bases of training sequentially give up such defilement.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2875,id:UT22084-068-021-5551}}}“ ‘A lay practitioner whose practice is unstable may take up one of the bases of training but then later see his practice interrupted. As he reflects on the situation, he may instead pursue another basis for training. In this manner, in a sequential process and by means of sporadic intentions, he will receive the bases of training in an unstable manner from several spiritual teachers. {{page:{number:1293,id:UT22084-068-021-101321,folio:F.105.a,volume:V70}}} This refers to a layperson who engages with the bases of training sequentially.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2876,id:UT22084-068-021-5552}}}“ ‘There is also a second kind of lay practitioner known as the half-damaged. What is meant by half-damaged? Such a person does not follow the bases of training at the same time, but first assumes two and then later, after an interruption, the other three. He may also first take up three and then later assume two. That is known as half-damaged, in reference to the subsequent damage to the bases of training. Such a person follows a half-damaged set. Practicing a half-damaged set, he is known as a lay practitioner who is half-damaged.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2877,id:UT22084-068-021-5553}}}“ ‘A third kind of lay practitioner adheres to the bases of training with regret. Such a person does not take up the bases of training to begin with but engages instead in meaningful conduct exclusively out of faith in the buddhas, and so forth. If at some point such a person learns from the monks that reaching the transcendence of suffering is an effect of observing vows, that knowledge may bring him searing pangs of regret. He may then assume the bases of training and adhere to them for as long as he is alive. That is a lay practitioner with regret.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2878,id:UT22084-068-021-5554}}}“ ‘There is also a fourth kind of lay practitioner, known as one who practices the complete set. What is understood by practicing the complete set? Such people receive the teachings of the sacred Dharma and, based on the various statements, expressions, and discourses that they receive, realize how phenomena are dependently originated. They settle on that understanding, develop faith, tame their faculties, and adhere to all the vows. At that time, such people adhere to the complete set of the five bases of training. {{page:{number:1294,id:UT22084-068-021-101322,folio:F.105.b,volume:V70}}} They adhere to them well, observing them for as long as they are alive and in a way that is free from damage, interruption, or defilement.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2879,id:UT22084-068-021-5555}}}“ ‘The former and latter sets of four lay practitioners can be further divided in terms of inferiority, mediocrity, and superiority. The superior lay practitioners that were mentioned before are the same as those who practice the complete set, while those who observe less than all are the same as those who practice sequentially. Lay practitioners who practice less than the complete set possess unfathomable qualities, even if their observance of vows lasts for just one moment. No deity, māra, or god can compare to them. Why? Because their nature consists in the transcendence of suffering, whereas no god progresses toward the city of the transcendence of suffering.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2880,id:UT22084-068-021-5556}}}“ ‘The terrestrial yakṣas worship and honor people who have taken vows whenever they see them. The celestial yakṣas worship and honor them whenever they see them. With concern for the Dharma, they accompany them and serve them. They also keep the gods informed. As for effects experienced in the present life, the rulers of the land, kings and royal ministers, will offer them worship and wealth. The gods will remain close to them, and enable them to perform magical feats and develop great powers. Yakṣas that are averse to the Dharma cannot cause them any harm.{{note:{index:413,id:UT22084-068-021-5557}}} If any of them have a lot of worries, they will find relief. Such people also succeed in their activities without any hardship. {{page:{number:1295,id:UT22084-068-021-101323,folio:F.106.a,volume:V70}}} They will not suffer terribly from disease. Their countenances will be clear and bright. They will fall asleep and wake up happily. They will be on good terms with their children, male and female servants, employees, and temporary workers. Upon the disintegration of their bodies, they will go to the joyous higher realms and be born in a world of gods. When born as gods, their size, appearance, and form will correspond with the way they observed their vows.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2881,id:UT22084-068-021-5558}}}“ ‘In this way, such people experience magnificent effects that are due to their previous actions. Still, although they have produced such virtues, those who become careless will eventually bring their virtues to exhaustion in the Heaven Free from Strife. With their minds caught in the web of karmic actions, such beings will later, by the force of their karma, be born among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. Therefore, one must reflect on this until one has permanently adopted the ways of the noble ones. Gods whose minds have made them live carelessly will experience intense regrets at the time of death and transmigration. As their virtuous actions are finally depleted, they must depart for the realms of hell, starving spirits, or animals. Therefore, without any delay, make sure to stay free of carelessness!
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2882,id:UT22084-068-021-5559}}}“ ‘The four types of suffering make lay practitioners develop weariness with respect to the present life. Then, as they joyfully engage in the proper tasks, they will reach the goal of suffering’s transcendence. Among the fourfold retinue of the buddhas, this was the description of the retinue of male lay practitioners.
The Female Lay Practitioner
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2883,id:UT22084-068-021-5561}}}“ ‘What, then, is the retinue of female lay practitioners, and how many kinds are there in that retinue? The buddhas’ female lay practitioners are of the following four kinds: the faithful, those born into the family, the contented, and the cohabiting.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2884,id:UT22084-068-021-5562}}}“ ‘Who are faithful female lay practitioners? They are women whose mindstreams have been auspiciously infused in past lives; {{page:{number:1296,id:UT22084-068-021-101324,folio:F.106.b,volume:V70}}} their minds have been infused, and their minds are gentle and well trained. Because their mindstreams have been auspiciously infused, even just hearing a few words of the buddhas’ teachings will make them develop excellent understanding. They gain knowledge, experience, and apply what they know. Since their minds are focused on the Dharma-Vinaya, they receive vows and adhere to them. They will not be swayed by the general mindset of women, nor will exposure to the statements of non-Buddhists hold any sway over them. They will not engage in conversation with non-Buddhists either. Their faith arises only toward the buddhas, and so on. They kneel and receive all five bases of training at once. Such female lay practitioners are known as faithful.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2885,id:UT22084-068-021-5563}}}“ ‘Next, who are the female lay practitioners born into the family? Here family refers to a family that is wholesome, takes refuge in the Dharma, takes the Dharma as its savior, takes the Dharma as its protector, holds the Dharma as its family lineage, sees the Dharma as what matters most, practices without hesitation, and is never defeated by the attacks of others. Such a family is a stable home of lay practitioners where faith in the buddhas and the like is strong. When a girl is born into such a family, she will hear the teachings of the buddhas right from the time of her birth. Whatever she comes to hear will always become a reason for further studies. She will always engage in self-cultivation and become a female lay practitioner whose mindstream is trained.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2886,id:UT22084-068-021-5564}}}‘Next, who are contented female lay practitioners? Such women have faith in the buddhas and the like from the very beginning, but it never becomes great. If they follow a spiritual teacher, they will indeed develop faith, but they will then feel very content with the qualities that they have gained {{page:{number:1297,id:UT22084-068-021-101325,folio:F.107.a,volume:V70}}} and in this way their practice becomes limited and partial. That is what is meant by contented female lay practitioners.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2887,id:UT22084-068-021-5565}}}“ ‘What is meant by cohabiting female lay practitioners? Such women will converse with non-Buddhists, cohabit with them, and assume their ways of conduct. Nevertheless, when they meet mendicants, they will be inspired by their conduct. When they notice the mendicants’ unique appearance and the serene way in which they eat, wear their robes, and comport themselves, women of this type will seek refuge. They will then develop faith in the buddhas, who are superior to any non-Buddhist mendicants, and eventually they will also receive and adhere to the vows of the Vinaya. That is what is meant by cohabiting female lay practitioners.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2888,id:UT22084-068-021-5566}}}“ ‘In this way, there are four categories with respect to both male and female lay practitioners. Here the four types of female lay practitioner have been stated in brief. As explained before, male lay practitioners may differ in terms of their different interests, mental dispositions, and various contributing conditions, and the same applies to female lay practitioners. Likewise, just as female lay practitioners may differ with respect to the Dharma-Vinaya, the same is the case with the male lay practitioners that were mentioned before. From the perspective of their mindstreams, they are also known as those with varied practice.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2889,id:UT22084-068-021-5567}}}“ ‘All such male and female lay practitioners who have the fortune of merit, who possess the genuine view, and who let the true view inform their actions will, upon the disintegration of their bodies, journey to the higher realms and, in accordance with their individual qualities, {{page:{number:1298,id:UT22084-068-021-101326,folio:F.107.b,volume:V70}}} be born in inferior, intermediate, or superior divine worlds.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2890,id:UT22084-068-021-5568}}}“ ‘Some of them are born among the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife. That is what happens to those who have practiced and accumulated discipline. The gods are born into their realms exclusively as a result of their virtuous discipline, yet once they are born there, they act carelessly. Only when they have finally adopted the ways of the noble ones will they give up such conduct. Hence, as their merits are depleted, they will again be born in the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. Their birth in those realms is the negative effect of their carelessness. On the other hand, those among them who refrain from careless conduct will instead go from one joyous stage to another. Such is the magnificence of their pure and excellent training in discipline.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2891,id:UT22084-068-021-5569}}}“ ‘Therefore, do not be careless, even in the slightest way. Carelessness is like poison. It is the slayer of all childish beings, the destroyer of all objectives, and the chain that binds one to the whole of cyclic existence. Therefore, no god or human should ever be careless. Whether you are a god or a human, if you spend your life in carelessness once you have achieved the beautiful results of such discipline, then that would be a gravely egregious mistake. You will then continue to cycle through the lower realms of existence for an extremely long time.’
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2892,id:UT22084-068-021-5570}}}“In this way, Musulundha delivers this teaching to the gods. When the gods receive this teaching—given by the Blessed One for the sake of gods and humans and miraculously inscribed upon the emanated stūpa—they become distressed and saddened by cyclic existence.

How many types are there? What are their qualities? What are they based on? What are their vows? How many ways are there to give rise to the vows of spiritual practitioners?
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2894,id:UT22084-068-021-5572}}}“ ‘The blessed ones’ nuns and monks practice for the sake of the transcendence of suffering, they train in concentration throughout the day and night, and they muster diligence such that they strike fear in the retinues of the māras.
The Nuns
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2895,id:UT22084-068-021-5574}}}“ ‘Among the nuns, what are their characteristic features? They are learned, bright, and gentle.

Likewise, from the very beginning they investigate the nature of reality. Regarding the bodies of men and themselves, when they see a well-built man, or man of outstanding physique, they train in regarding him as their brother or son. These are the three roots of virtuous training, and such a state of mind causes them to cut through all bonds.

{{milestone:{label:4.C.2898,id:UT22084-068-021-5577}}}“ ‘For example, the sun shines and fire burns, earth is solid, wind is light and moving, water is wet and liquid—this is how the characteristics of the four great elements have been conclusively determined. Similarly, women are always—at all times and in all circumstances—filled with desire and they pursue their desires. This gives rise to two further stains, namely envy and stinginess. And these give rise to another stain, that of trickery. From that follows another stain, which is fraudulence. From that follows the stain of not becoming free from existence. From that follow the stains of hankering after good looks and disregarding those who do not have relations with them. From that follows the stain of being frivolous. {{page:{number:1301,id:UT22084-068-021-101329,folio:F.109.a,volume:V70}}} From that follows the stain of quarreling with their family and kin. From that follows the stain of delighting in creating divisions. From that follows the stain of backbiting.{{note:{index:414,id:UT22084-068-021-5578}}} From that follows the stain of trespassing where they should not go. From that follows the stain of failing to have trust. From that follows the stain of teaching other women to behave divisively. From that follows the stain of not being able to appreciate anything. From that follows the stain of gluttony.{{note:{index:415,id:UT22084-068-021-5579}}} From that follows the stain of destroying the realm. From that follows the stain of going from darkness to more darkness, heading straight down to the hells.

Women who become purified in this way can then skillfully train in a gradual manner and thereby purify themselves, as well as others. As they go forth with faith, they connect with what is wholesome and train in virtue, whether on their own or by following a spiritual teacher. Just at the rising sun dispels the darkness in mountain caves and ravines, they conquer the darkness of all these numerous flaws that have followed their minds since time without beginning. {{page:{number:1302,id:UT22084-068-021-101330,folio:F.109.b,volume:V70}}} Likewise, as they engage in conversations on the sun of the Dharma, they crush a mountain of flaws.

This is because spiritual teachers are the cause of the aforementioned genuine remedies. They establish others on the true path. Liberating from all suffering, they establish one in happiness. They explain the excellent path. They conquer the darkness that has otherwise existed since time without beginning. They give instructions for the path of virtue. They free others permanently from the sharp pains of desire and the like. They are profoundly saddened by those who wander through the ravines of existence. They explain well the happy state of the city that is permanently free from aging and death. Therefore, I shall now deliver the kinds of statements that will reverse those stains. Those stains, which appear in the progression that was just outlined, will then be overcome and destroyed in that order. All of these faults are primarily related to women and not men; envy and stinginess are generally related to women. It is by going through the progression and reversal of those faults that their remedies are applied, and one is thus delivered from cyclic existence.

In this way one analyzes the body, thinking of it in terms of its unpleasant and unclean form. One should ask oneself, “Given that the living body is so filthy, could our bodies possibly contain anything clean at all?”
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2902,id:UT22084-068-021-5583}}}“ ‘When thus pursuing and exploring the way things are, one may notice that filth oozes from nine wounds on the body. Both women and men have those wounds. What are those nine wounds? In fact, women have more than nine as they include the two breasts in addition to the anus, the urinal tract, and the nostrils from which flows mucus. Tears are secreted from the eyes. Dirt is produced in the ears, and blood and pus emerge from the mouth. There are also hundreds of impure substances that ooze from the body, such as foul-smelling gas, gall, phlegm, blood, and excrement. That becomes clear to the one who examines the body in accordance with reality. Since our bodies do not contain the slightest bit or trace of anything clean, how could anyone perceive it as something pleasant?
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2903,id:UT22084-068-021-5584}}}“ ‘Moreover, when things that are otherwise clean come into contact with this body, its filthy character will rub off on them. As one examines these matters, one will see how contact with the body makes clean things as filthy as the body itself. For example, when food and drink is consumed, they first disappear, only to emerge in the form of excrement as a result of their relationship with the body. {{page:{number:1304,id:UT22084-068-021-101332,folio:F.110.b,volume:V70}}} All the food that one eats is turned into filth.

When a nun thus investigates, she will come to see that the bodies of all mothers in her family are also exceedingly unclean. Likewise, in her analysis of the body, the nun may examine whether the place or locality where the body is situated should be thought of as clean or unclean. She will then correctly notice that since the body comes with germs, stains, hair, and bones, even the most pristine and exalted setting will become smelly if a body—whether dead or alive—is placed there.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2906,id:UT22084-068-021-5587}}}“ ‘Likewise, as the nun inquires further in order to give up desire, she may ask herself, “Who would eat this body?” She will then realize, “Only rākṣasas, piśācas, or other filthy creatures of that sort would do so. This body would not be consumed by swans, ducks, or geese that live among pure lotus flowers.” {{page:{number:1305,id:UT22084-068-021-101333,folio:F.111.a,volume:V70}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2907,id:UT22084-068-021-5588}}}“ ‘When her own body is seen in accordance with an accurate investigation of the way things are, the nun will realize that wholly inaccurate thinking, mistaken thoughts, and incorrect mental activity all have a blinding effect, such that the mere words man and woman come to be accepted as referring to something real. As she recognizes this, she will give rise to correct mental activity and thereby achieve understanding. At that time, all her desire will be relinquished, diminished, and fundamentally destroyed, because all of it is rooted in so-called “female desire.” All other stains arise from that, so relinquishing desire constitutes the remedy for relinquishing all the other stains. For example, whenever the sun is present, the light that shines in the world of humans will not fade. Likewise, desire is an especially fundamental stain, so when this stain is overcome, all the other stains will be conquered too. This is the path whereby the nun conquers desire.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2908,id:UT22084-068-021-5589}}}“ ‘What other co-emergent factors will be destroyed when desire is conquered? Envy and stinginess, which emerge from desire. Whether one is a man or a woman, those two factors emerge from desire. So, when desire is relinquished, or when it weakens, those two will weaken too.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2909,id:UT22084-068-021-5590}}}“ ‘What further stain follows invariably from the former two? Trickery. Trickery is caused by envy and stinginess, and thus when those two disappear, so will deceit. Based on trickery follows another stain, fraudulence. When envy and stinginess disappear, one will not engage in fraudulence either. {{page:{number:1306,id:UT22084-068-021-101334,folio:F.111.b,volume:V70}}} But with fraudulence follows another stain, which is craving. When deception is destroyed, craving will not manifest and thus there will be no craving. When there is no craving, there will not be desire for those who cohabit and no rejection of those who do not cohabit. When such does not occur, another stain will likewise be absent, namely being frivolous. When that is absent, there will not be quarrels or divisiveness either—women are otherwise prone to inciting discord. When that is not present in a woman, there is a further stain that will not be present either, which is backbiting. Women are intent on creating divisions and hence they backbite in all sorts of ways. When they give up divisiveness, they also give up backbiting. When that is relinquished, another, related factor will also disappear, which is gluttony. Women are eager to fill their stomachs and to overeat.{{note:{index:416,id:UT22084-068-021-5591}}} Hence, when the stain of gluttony is pacified, the stain of trespassing where one should not go will also be relinquished. Because of the flaw of gluttony, women go to men they should not go to. Hence, when they become free from the desire for filling their bellies, the stain of going where they should not go will also be pacified. Once that disappears, another stain will be pacified, which is being untrustworthy. When women trespass where they should not go, no man will trust them {{page:{number:1307,id:UT22084-068-021-101335,folio:F.112.a,volume:V70}}} and no man will be fond of them. Another stain that concurs with, and follows from, trespassing where one should not go is that of having intercourse. Once the desire to have intercourse has vanished, another factor will disappear. What is that? Taking pleasure in dispute. When there is no fondness for dispute, another related stain will disappear, which is that of destroying the realm. When there is no fondness for dispute there are no threats to the realm either, and so the realm is not destroyed.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2910,id:UT22084-068-021-5592}}}“ ‘When men in various ways develop animosity and seek to hurt one another with weapons, the cause of that is generally women, and not any other cause. Hence, by conquering desire, all the various flaws that successively give rise to one another will also thereby disappear.

Only by hearing the words of the buddhas from the mouths of spiritual teachers can their minds become gentle, not in any other way. There is no other way that women can become gentle. However, when they do, they give up the household—that which is so difficult to give up—and with faith they go forth from the household to become homeless mendicants. Even if they are incapable of bringing an end to the defilements, they will nevertheless train in discipline by abstaining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, harsh words, and divisive talk, giving up all such actions. Women who in this way attend to, cultivate, and increase their discipline will, upon the destruction of their bodies, go to the joyous higher realms and be born among the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife. Those who have not attained the path of freedom from desire for pleasures {{page:{number:1308,id:UT22084-068-021-101336,folio:F.112.b,volume:V70}}} but continue to pursue pleasures based on their karmic actions and minds will be born among the gods in Moving in Gatherings within in the Heaven Free from Strife.

The Monks

As the monks progressively assume their vows, their being becomes suffused with supremely vast virtues. They are wary of encountering suffering, afraid of the journey to other realms, and they become disenchanted by the whole of cyclic existence. They regard even the slightest unwholesomeness as frightening, yet they are undaunted when faced with any task, no matter how big.{{note:{index:418,id:UT22084-068-021-5605}}} Their virtues are supremely profound and vast, their minds are attuned to generosity and discipline, and they diligently train in the four truths of noble beings.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2920,id:UT22084-068-021-5606}}}“ ‘What are the distinctive features of such monks? There are four things that such monks must refrain from. What are they? A monk must refrain from roaming alone and should not journey without company. Why is that? Because a monk who roams alone through the land will be derided. He might also become lax and will thus transgress the bases of training. In towns, cities, markets, and throughout the countryside he may, for selfish concerns, abandon his vows, for he will not be apprehensive of other monks. When he sees the women of the area, he may ogle them with a restless mind stirred by hope and fear.{{note:{index:419,id:UT22084-068-021-5607}}} When the householders and other people of the area see that, they will then deride the monk. When the monk becomes the object of their scorn, he might develop anger, and thus a second flaw will arise in his mind: anger. Swayed by desire and anger, he will become intensely bewildered in his ignorance. {{page:{number:1310,id:UT22084-068-021-101338,folio:F.113.b,volume:V70}}} In this way, three flaws will proliferate if a monk roams alone through the land. Therefore, do not roam the land alone. That is one point.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2921,id:UT22084-068-021-5608}}}“ ‘Mindfulness of the body is another point that a monk must avoid transgressing. When a monk is on the road, he should develop mindfulness about all that is contained within his body. For example, when he lifts his foot, his mind and mental states should be employed in a process of thinking and contemplation that allows for an exploration of the entire body, from the feet upward. As he lifts one of his feet, he should notice how the muscles and tendons are all connected. The bones are covered by fat and skin and the joints held together by muscles. The mind, which moves due to the wind of karma, remains attentive. He notices how raising his foot to take a step creates contraction, which is then released as the foot is placed on the ground. The legs and feet are nourished by veins that extend into the five toes, upon which grow the nails with their plates and margins. Then he proceeds to examine the knees, which resemble elongated cups to which lumps of flesh are attached, connected by sinew and hollow bones covered in nerves. The body, which is produced by the power of past actions, is enveloped in skin that has pores, thus attracting flies from the outside. The monk will examine each knee, which is wrapped in thick skin.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2922,id:UT22084-068-021-5609}}}“ ‘When gradually analyzing the movements of his body as he walks, the monk will examine the knees, thighs, and calves with their lymph, blood, flesh, and bone. As his mind and mental states are moved by the wind of karma, that causes him to walk. {{page:{number:1311,id:UT22084-068-021-101339,folio:F.114.a,volume:V70}}} Moreover, maintaining the notion of the body, he will apply his inquiry from above and all the way down.{{note:{index:420,id:UT22084-068-021-5610}}} He will notice how the flesh and the veins are connected and form large lumps of greasy flesh dripping with lymph and filled with blood and fat. Only the mere outer luster is attractive. Examining things in this way, he understands how the leg is a web of veins. When a foot is lifted, he recognizes precisely that. When a leg is bent or stretched, he notices the many fine veins. He discerns how the stomach functions by means of numerous moving and shifting winds, thus serving as the foundation for the production and excretion of feces and urine.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2923,id:UT22084-068-021-5611}}}“ ‘As he is mindful of his own moving body in accordance with the way things are, he will say to himself, “When I walk, my intestines and colon are in movement. This occurs each time I take a step or draw a breath. In this way my intestines keep moving from side to side.” This is how he observes the movements of his intestines, which are filled with air, gall, mucus, excrement, slime, and worms. When the monk has observed his intestines, he will expand his examination to include the other bodies he may see. {{page:{number:1312,id:UT22084-068-021-101340,folio:F.114.b,volume:V70}}} Thus, he notices how the various intestines function as a web within which tasty food putrefies. The moment he considers this mass, he feels like vomiting. It contains bile, is full of diseases, and produces a terrifying stench. The monk also sees how the throat, eyes, organs, and bones are all merely held together by the wind of karmic action and the grasping of mind and mental states. This is how he examines his body as he walks and when the body otherwise moves.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2924,id:UT22084-068-021-5612}}}“ ‘The monk then thinks, “My mouth, cheekbones, and skull are all joined together. There are also two sockets for the eyes that can be either closed or opened to the eyeballs. All of these body parts of mine are joined with strings of sinew, just like a wooden marionette doll. In one moment it is born, only to die and transmigrate in the next. That is how it saunters through towns, cities, and markets. I shall not amble around with such passionate fondness for the contents of this assembled body, which is just like the innards of a poisonous snake. I shall not crave for food, and I shall not laugh.” In this way, in terms of moving around, the traveling monk does not transgress the second point.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2925,id:UT22084-068-021-5613}}}“ ‘When he goes to obtain alms in towns, cities, and villages, he correctly examines his body. Men and women who thus meditate well on the body and engender diligence will harbor no flaws of desire or the like in their hearts. The monk in this way does not transgress the training, even at the cost of his life, {{page:{number:1313,id:UT22084-068-021-101341,folio:F.115.a,volume:V70}}} and thus he will not commit any breaches due to desire.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2926,id:UT22084-068-021-5614}}}“ ‘There is also a third point that a monk should not transgress because a monk should practice constant mindfulness. Practicing mindfulness, he should be attentive. A monk who achieves a virtuous and undistracted mind due to the influence of his spiritual teacher will always be followed by the gods, and the gods of the māra class cannot hurt him.{{note:{index:421,id:UT22084-068-021-5615}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2927,id:UT22084-068-021-5616}}} “ ‘How does he practice mindfulness in this way? Having first developed interest, he engages his mind and mental states, thus becoming attentive to what is currently present and what is not. He is then careful and attentive with regard to what has not yet manifested. Based on such observation, the mind and mental states that are either virtuous, unvirtuous, or neutral will manifest. There are also unique conditions that result in virtuous factors that are beneficial and delightful and that culminate in the transcendence of suffering. However, if those factors weaken, certain other unique conditions of the mind and mental states will result in factors that are unvirtuous, disturbed, and unpleasant. In this way, he recognizes the virtuous factors exactly as they are, discerns them, and keeps them in mind. He also analyzes unpleasant factors in this way.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2928,id:UT22084-068-021-5617}}}“ ‘The monk does not relish objects due to the fivefold mindfulness, and his mind does not engage in thinking of them. What is the fivefold mindfulness? When experiencing the visual object of an attractive form, the monk does not savor it by first developing notions about it and then seeing it as either near or distant, as pretty or unattractive, as meager {{page:{number:1314,id:UT22084-068-021-101342,folio:F.115.b,volume:V70}}} or decayed from previous greatness, or as personally owned or enjoyed by others. Thereby the monk will not savor any form. He will not examine forms and will relinquish them, even those that arise due to circumstance. Just as people may avoid fire due to fear of being burned, the monk is afraid of craving desire, and thus he does not reminisce about forms that are associated with lustful desire and that culminate in suffering. He does not think of them and does not let his mind be preoccupied by them. In this way, he does not concern himself with the many different past enjoyments of himself or others. He does not pursue them, and if his companions or followers indulge in such experiences, he will attempt to stop them. He will not condone what they do but instead seek to establish them on the path. Such an unwavering monk does not hanker or yearn for pleasures but practices mindfulness and is free from afflictive factors. As he maintains his commitments, his eye consciousness will not be carried away by its experience of forms.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2929,id:UT22084-068-021-5618}}}“ ‘Likewise, due to the second type of mindfulness, he will not reminisce about past enjoyments of delightful songs, music, laughter, games, or pleasures. He will not pay them any attention and will not conceive of them. All those innumerable events that occurred due to conditions he will abandon due to such conditions. Just as some people will completely stay away from a fire due to the condition of its burning, the monk will stay away from such factors due to such conditions. {{page:{number:1315,id:UT22084-068-021-101343,folio:F.116.a,volume:V70}}} Similarly, if his followers or companions indulge their ear consciousness in the experience of sound, he will not condone it but establish them on the path. A monk who thus practices supremely virtuous actions is not impressed by pleasures and is not swayed by the yearning for sound. He is not carried away by sound. A monk thus endowed with the second kind of mindfulness musters diligence. He conscientiously accustoms himself to the discipline of pure conduct.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2930,id:UT22084-068-021-5619}}}“ ‘Moreover, the monk does not cultivate, relish, or mentally register any past experiences of smell. He does not think of smells, whether they be fragrant, repulsive, inferior, superior, or close by. He does not let his mind focus on them. He relinquishes those that, due to conditions, have become inner factors. Moreover, he seeks to make his followers or companions disengage from the experience of smells by their olfactory consciousness, as well as from the mental preoccupation with such experiences. From the very beginning, he seeks to stop such activities and he does not condone them. In this way, the monk makes both himself and others engage in virtuous practices, he is endowed with virtuous qualities, and he abides by mindfulness in a way that is conscientious and free from attachment. His consciousness will not be carried away by hankering for olfactory experiences. Such a monk purifies unwholesome factors, adheres to excellent discipline, and abides by mindfulness. He does not let his mindfulness dwell on past experiences. He does not seek to relive pleasant events, whether they took place long ago or just recently, and he does not think of them. Those that occur due to conditions he will abandon as if they were fire. {{page:{number:1316,id:UT22084-068-021-101344,folio:F.116.b,volume:V70}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2931,id:UT22084-068-021-5620}}}“ ‘Moreover, if his followers or companions become swayed by the experience of taste and are carried away by yearning for it, he will not rejoice in that, and he will try to stop them. Such a monk who is without attachment, abides by mindfulness, possesses alertness, vanquishes what is unwholesome, and is endowed with virtuous discipline is known to be someone who benefits both himself and others.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2932,id:UT22084-068-021-5621}}}“ ‘Likewise, such a monk does not train in unwholesome discipline and does not touch anything that, if touched, would disturb his equipoise. Because the pleasures such things provide are afflictive, he does not relish the qualities of things that are thick, hard, or solid. He does not think about them and those that arise due to conditions he abandons like fire. He also encourages others to do the same. He does not rejoice if someone is carried away by craving for bodily textures. Such a monk, who has relinquished taste and touch, is alert, possesses pure discipline, practices pure conduct, and abides by virtuous qualities, is known as one who is destined for the transcendence of suffering.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2933,id:UT22084-068-021-5622}}}“ ‘There is also another fivefold practice of mindfulness that a monk must constantly engage in and keep in mind. Which is that practice? It is mindfulness of time, age, the transcendence of suffering, going, and staying. How should a monk practice mindfulness of time? In this regard, a monk cultivates constant mindfulness of the body such that he becomes undeluded and is not overcome by objects. He does not let his practice deteriorate. Monks must understand that they should recognize virtuous factors throughout the day and night. Without falling asleep, they will thus become endowed with the so-called diligence regarding breathing. They think, “The exhalation and inhalation of the breath are momentary and experienced due to conditions. {{page:{number:1317,id:UT22084-068-021-101345,folio:F.117.a,volume:V70}}} When the chest is first empty and then expands, the abdomen likewise grows. This momentary process continues due to the elements and sense sources—this conditioned process occurs as the elements, aggregates, and sense sources come together. The winds that are associated with the closing and opening of the eyes, as well as the breath, are all conditioned phenomena. They all diminish, disintegrate, and end. The very moment that happens, other conditions produce new occurrences, and thus in each moment an ongoing process of breathing takes place.” In this way, the monk is mindful of time, engaging his mind in liberating activities so as to achieve discernment.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2934,id:UT22084-068-021-5623}}}“ ‘This body, which is a gathering of elements and sense sources, is harmed momentarily from within; it is empty and contains no agent or anyone who feels. This body is created due to a mutual relationship of causes and conditions. From moment to moment, it is born and dies. It is nothing but an aggregate of aging, death, transmigration, and rebirth. Such are all the aggregates of cyclic existence.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2935,id:UT22084-068-021-5624}}}“ ‘The monk who meditates in this way ensures that these moments of time are not fruitless. Endowed with fourfold purity, his mind is pure, and so is his complexion. Moreover, his virtuous and unvirtuous actions become clear. When donors and benefactors examine the discipline of such a monk, who does what is beneficial beyond this world and is headed for the transcendence of suffering, they will feel enraptured, and thus their minds will become pleased. {{page:{number:1318,id:UT22084-068-021-101346,folio:F.117.b,volume:V70}}} A monk who is disciplined and supremely virtuous and who engages with the true meaning will be pure in this fourfold way. With such a mind that is pure in all regards, his sleep will be happy, and as he sleeps, he will be in possession of the Dharma and have excellent dreams that are related to the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2936,id:UT22084-068-021-5625}}}“ ‘Without becoming infatuated, he will be careful, and thereby seven factors will increase. What are the seven? (1) He will attain Dharma acumen that discerns virtuous factors. (2) He will also attain joy in practicing virtuous activity, and this joy will greatly increase. (3) As his joy grows, the relationships between name and form{{note:{index:422,id:UT22084-068-021-5626}}} will bring further well-being. Such increasing and expanding causal factors will keep his body free from disease. (4) Due to the relationships between body and mind he will then develop excellent happiness and thus perspicacity. (5) With the attainment of perspicacity comes the ability to remember the virtuous factors he produced earlier, and thus his perspicacity will further increase. (6) Also, his continuous mindfulness of virtuous factors will increase. As he recollects virtuous factors, the happiness that is associated with that will increase. (7) With the increase in happiness comes an increase in power. As these seven factors grow, he will spend the night happily, and even while he sleeps he will be cultivating both his body and his mind.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2937,id:UT22084-068-021-5627}}}“ ‘In this way also he will be mindful of time. How may a monk be truly mindful of time during the day and night? Monks, such a monk knows when he closes and opens an eye. In the moment of closing the eye, the monk thus understands that the attainment of a timespan and the accompanying elements of mind and mental states will all soon disintegrate and decay. Is time also something that gradually ceases and arises? {{page:{number:1319,id:UT22084-068-021-101347,folio:F.118.a,volume:V70}}} Whoever has been born is subject to the expiration of life. That is to say, youth is depleted by aging. There is no one alive who is able to turn back the Lord of Death, the one who slays all living beings. He descends extremely swiftly and abruptly, and that marks the end of one’s life. Yet the karmic imprints for life are activated extremely quickly, and thus there is no cause for tears. For example, the fire that makes a lamp burn also consumes its oil. In the same way, all the factors of clinging consume the oil of life. Think of this, monks, and pursue what is definitively good!
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2938,id:UT22084-068-021-5628}}}“ ‘Just as inner entities are brought to exhaustion by four destructive factors, so outer conditioned entities are likewise demolished by those four. This applies to mountains, forests, rivers, cities, towns, markets, flatlands, and parks where people gather. This is also how the divine worlds disintegrate and disappear. As the gods enjoy themselves carelessly in their forests, parks, pools, and groves, they are utterly destroyed. As they disappear, they are instead reborn among hell beings, starving spirits, and animals.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2939,id:UT22084-068-021-5629}}}“ ‘Without distraction, the monk will look at the way these beings of the world all experience their own karmic actions and thus are unable to remain. With a concentrated mind and stable and undistracted mindfulness, he regards reality. As he thus gains understanding, he is, at that very time, also endowed with mindfulness and alertness. Whatever that monk does, he will think, “Now it is time to perform my duties,{{note:{index:423,id:UT22084-068-021-5630}}}{{page:{number:1320,id:UT22084-068-021-101348,folio:F.118.b,volume:V70}}} abide by my vows, and purify stains.

Birth as a human being occurs based on one’s karmic actions, and thus one’s mental and physical continua go through the stages of the oval shape, the oblong, the hardened, the round, the lumpy, and the development of major and minor body parts.

Mindfulness of death, transmigration, and rebirth. On this he should meditate even during the night. All sentient beings in the end will die. Those who are alive will become the dead. All beings in the three realms are subject to impermanence, arising, and ceasing. They are subject to harm and, though gathered, they must eventually part. When they pass away from the god realm, they transmigrate and take birth in the hells. When they pass away and transmigrate from one hell realm, they may be born in another. When they pass away and transmigrate from the hells, they may be born as gods. When humans die, they take birth as hell beings, starving spirits, animals, gods, or humans. When starving spirits die, they take birth as hell beings, starving spirits, animals, gods, or humans. In this way—below, in front, and above—the winds of karmic action keep sentient beings churning through the realms of cyclic existence. Thus they wander, experiencing their individual shares of karmic action. They circle throughout the great ocean of cyclic existence.

He will not associate with donors or benefactors out of desire. When he sees kings or royal ministers, and when he sees their pleasures, he does not apprehend any of that as delightful. He is not bound by craving. He does not think of pleasures during the day, nor does he do so at night. Nor does he appropriate for himself any other type of wealth that he investigates.

It is not easy to find an example to illustrate such suffering.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2956,id:UT22084-068-021-5650}}}“ ‘As the monk properly examines prosperity and decline, he does not even wish for the pleasures of the king of the gods. Therefore, how could he have any wish for the pleasures of human kings or universal monarchs, since he sees them all as various types of the suffering of decline? Any amount of achievements attained by other powerful beings—whether kings, ministers, householders, or nobility—will eventually decline, either all at once or repeatedly. They must all part from their sons, male servants, female servants, staff, and laborers. As they fall into decline, they will become terrorized by others. When that happens, they will be found at the roadside or at intersections, with broken arms and legs, dripping with blood, in tatters, starving and thirsting. Desperately, they must migrate from city to city, town to town, mountain to mountain, valley to valley, undergoing unbearable, endless pain. As the monk sees how this will be their experience, and as he keeps that in mind, he becomes weary of cyclic existence, the abyss of objects.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2957,id:UT22084-068-021-5651}}} “ ‘As the monk comes in this way to regard human prosperity as decline, he will also reflect on the state of the gods.

Their pains and terrors are numerous beyond description. The gods, on the other hand, have bodies without flesh, bones, and lymph, and they experience exquisite heavenly pleasures. Draped with lotus garlands of divine substance, they are surrounded by many thousands of other gods. In the midst of goddesses with indescribable qualities, they enjoy the pleasures of excitement, grace, and jest. Their divine parks, pools, and mountain summits are ablaze with brilliant jewels, and the music of the five types of instruments resounds continuously as they joyfully gallivant around. Within mansions made of the seven precious substances, these resplendent beings constantly indulge in a rich variety of indescribably delightful, pleasurable objects. They never harm one another, nor do they get into fights or disputes. Whatever the gods may wish for will manifest right then and there, simply by thinking of it, and thus, to the continuous music of the five types of instruments, their minds are constantly happy.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2958,id:UT22084-068-021-5652}}} “ ‘Yet, even these gods face the pains of decline. Once their karmic actions are exhausted, they again fall into the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. They are all headed for such lives. Their previous acts will cause them to die and transmigrate into numerous, utterly different forms of life. When born in the hells, the former god will be ablaze in ferocious flames. Tormented by indescribably intense hunger and thirst, he will be born into the hells of Reviving, Black Line, Crushing, Howling, {{page:{number:1326,id:UT22084-068-021-101354,folio:F.121.b,volume:V70}}} Great Howling, Heat, or Intense Heat. In accordance with his previous karmic actions, he may descend into any of the eight hells, except Ultimate Torment. At that time, he will witness the great suffering of loss, and thus suffering will suffuse his body and mind. This is not even easy to talk about. Such is the mindfulness that the monk will cultivate again and again, throughout day and night.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2959,id:UT22084-068-021-5653}}} “ ‘The monk thus persists in his mindfulness of the consequences of divine and human prosperity, seeing all of the three realms as nothing but decline. Is there any satisfactory prosperity to be found by hell beings, starving spirits, or animals? In the case of gods and humans, it may be possible to speak of a bit of happiness. Yet, like straying into a woven net,{{note:{index:426,id:UT22084-068-021-5654}}} all their prosperity only sets them up for unavoidable decline.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2960,id:UT22084-068-021-5655}}}“ ‘There are five types of prosperity and decline that pertain to humans. What are they? First, when humans see forms that are delightful, agreeable, and attractive they look at them with craving. They relish what they see, wish for it, and feel happy. On the other hand, when they see something that is unhelpful, disagreeable, or unattractive, they lose their fondness and instead feel displeasure. This is how prosperity and decline apply to a single faculty.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2961,id:UT22084-068-021-5656}}}“ ‘Another way that a monk considers the relationship between decline and prosperity is as follows. When one hears sounds that are delightful, agreeable, appealing, attractive, or enrapturing, such that the mind becomes captivated, then that is a form of prosperity. However, when due to other circumstances the sounds {{page:{number:1327,id:UT22084-068-021-101355,folio:F.122.a,volume:V70}}} become undesirable, unappealing, or repulsive, a state of mental displeasure follows. Such unpleasantness and discomfort are a form of decline.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2962,id:UT22084-068-021-5657}}}“ ‘Likewise, the monk may experience the scents of a bouquet of flowers, perfumed powders, or other such enjoyable fragrances. At such times, his enjoyable feeling will be accompanied by mental pleasure. Yet the monk will still adhere to his training in maintaining a very stable mindfulness. On the other hand, when people register various kinds of unpleasant stenches—rotten, revolting, foul—those smells will be accompanied by mental unhappiness, and that is therefore a type of decline.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2963,id:UT22084-068-021-5658}}}“ ‘There are also other ways that such a monk may keep mindful of prosperity and decline in the human world. For instance, he will consider how those in the human world taste with their tongues. When a taste is appealing and agreeable, it is satisfying, and thus an enjoyable ripening takes place. When in this way many kinds of empowering, colorful, and delightful tastes are registered, there will be mental happiness. That is an instance of prosperity.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2964,id:UT22084-068-021-5659}}}“ ‘Likewise, in terms of registering sensations with his body, the monk may, for example, consider the pleasant sensation of warmth when one is feeling cold. At such a time, he will connect that experience with mindfulness of decline. This also applies to being cooled off when one is hot—those are forms of prosperity in the human world. On the other hand, different causes and conditions will give rise to an unpleasant bodily sensation {{page:{number:1328,id:UT22084-068-021-101356,folio:F.122.b,volume:V70}}} and thus the enjoyment may cease due to different objects.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2965,id:UT22084-068-021-5660}}}“ ‘Moreover, when there is contact between objects and the faculties, there arises a stable form of thinking that proliferates repeatedly in many directions, and thus, scorched by the fire of craving, all mundane people remain attached. Mindful of their decline, the monk will examine the inhabitants of the vastly enjoyable divine realms who persist in their craving and attachment. In this way, the monk whose mind is supremely virtuous sees all the six classes of the gods in the desire realm as destitute.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.2966,id:UT22084-068-021-5661}}}“ ‘The gods in the realm of the Four Great Kings experience twelve kinds of decline. What are they? During the battles between gods and asuras their capacity for running may slow down. They may fall as the asuras strike. They may fall into the ocean. They may lose their armor. They may separate from those they desire. While they are with those they desire and lust after, they may lose their head ornaments. They may faint at the sight of Rāhu. At the time of their death and transmigration, they will be abandoned by their goddesses of perfect size, shape, and adornments, who instead will seek out the newly born gods with whom to engage in great antics and endless play. In accordance with their actions, they may lose when they play. When playing, they may be reproached even by beings who have performed acts to be born as animals. When taking a seat upon a lotus flower, or when simply touching one, the flower may wither in accordance with their karmic actions. They may feel embarrassed when they see the ornaments and special adornments of gods who are more magnificent than they are. These twelve are forms of decline experienced by the gods of the realm of the Four Great Kings.

They may also fall off Airāvaṇa.{{note:{index:427,id:UT22084-068-021-5664}}} At times, when engaged in impure conduct, they may fail to see the points of entry.

When enjoying meals and games, their complexions, bodies, and power may decrease. Śakra may know all their different sounds, textures, tastes, forms, and scents to be substandard. At the time of their death and transmigration, their ladies will go elsewhere. During festive occasions, the speed of their traveling mansions may be slow.

If noticed by females, they may feel embarrassed when they have their meals. Due to insufficient karmic actions, other gods may not serve them and instead go to see a different god whom they treat as a king. The greatest of all such aspects of decline is the fear they may feel when Musulundha teaches the Dharma. Also, due to inferior karmic actions, their luster may be relatively dim. That is to say, other gods who enjoy positive karmic actions may outshine them in the same way as the sun outshines the planets, stars, and other celestial bodies in the world of humans. {{page:{number:1330,id:UT22084-068-021-101358,folio:F.123.b,volume:V70}}} When they take a seat, the precious substances of their seats may transform, whereas if gods who enjoy superior virtuous actions sit there, the same seats will turn into silver because of the higher quality of their karmic actions.

In a peaceful manner, he teaches the sacred Dharma, saying, “The condition of ignorance gives rise to formation. . . .” Those gods who hear the sacred Dharma, pay proper attention, and listen with inspiration will see their splendor, costumes, ornaments, and bodies become enriched a hundred thousand times. On the other hand, those gods whose minds are fickle like lightning and spin like water wheels will be pulled along by their craving for objects, and thus their splendor, attire, ornaments, and bodies will be overshadowed.

In this regard, those among them who are inclined to listen with respect will correctly realize the characteristics of the Dharma. Those who then remain attentive will see their own light expand, filling the environment and outshining that of others. The rest of the gods, however, will not experience such an increase in their light. When they think of the characteristics of the Dharma, they will not see their garments, ornaments, and bodies increase. That is the third aspect of decline that these gods encounter.

They will keep the Dharma in mind and apply it in the right manner. Retaining the teachings in their minds for a long time, they will accomplish the teachings. Those who develop proper respect for the Dharma will, by the power of listening to the Dharma, experience that all their splendor, garments, and ornaments increase a hundredfold. When the gods whose interest is inferior see how the glory of the others increases, they become embarrassed. That is the fourth aspect of decline that is known to the gods in the Heaven of Joy.

While the rest of their bodies remain luminous, the luminosity of their feet deteriorates as a shadow falls on them. All the other gods who bear garlands of light will notice the shadows and, upon seeing such inferior gods, will then shun them, laugh at them, and scorn them. This is what occurs when the paths of positive action are exhausted. {{page:{number:1336,id:UT22084-068-021-101364,folio:F.126.b,volume:V70}}} When their positive actions are exhausted those gods whose feet are scorned by the others feel extremely shamed by the words of the others. This is what happens to those whose positive karmic actions are exhausted. All prosperity ends in decline. For example, in the human realm, day is certain to be followed by night. Prosperity similarly always ends in decline. Also, all those who are alive will die. All prosperity similarly ends in decline. There is never an instance of prosperity that does not end in decline.

Likewise, when the divine inhabitants of the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations place their feet on the ground it gives way and springs back up when they lift them again. However, this does not happen to those gods whose positive karmic actions are nearing exhaustion. Instead, when they put a foot on the ground it sinks in, but the ground does not spring up again after the step. Therefore, when such gods walk around, the others will notice them and say to each other, “The positive actions of that god are certainly at the point of exhaustion.” Others may remark, “His positive actions are completely exhausted, and he is about to fall.” That is the second feature of decline that pertains to the gods in Delighting in Emanations. {{page:{number:1337,id:UT22084-068-021-101365,folio:F.127.a,volume:V70}}}

As the gods play, flowers will not fall on those whose positive karmic actions are exhausted. When the other gods notice that they are missing the shower of flowers, they will say to each other, “Alas, the positive karmic actions of those gods are at the point of exhaustion and they are about to fall.” Hearing this will make the gods who lack positive karmic actions feel acute embarrassment.

The gods are adorned with garlands of bright flowers made of divine substances that never wither. {{page:{number:1339,id:UT22084-068-021-101367,folio:F.128.a,volume:V70}}} It is not easy to give a comparison for the kinds of fragrance that those flower garlands produce, and their bright colors shine so brightly that the sun cannot even match a sixteenth of their brilliance. Birds adorned with the seven precious substances as well as buzzing bees constantly swarm around these heavenly flower garlands, yet when the time of a god’s decline arrives, the bees will leave his delightfully fragrant garland and fly elsewhere, making agitated sounds. When other gods of bright intellect see such decline, they will approach and conclude that obstacles have now occurred for that god whose merit has become exhausted. This is the first aspect of decline experienced by these feckless gods who act carelessly. The gods whose merit has become exhausted clearly become aware of this when they hear the bees leaving them and flying elsewhere. As they now ponder the indescribable pleasures of their realm, they will be struck by great agony. The particular mental torture they experience at that point is similar to the fires of hell. That is the first symptom of decline for the gods in the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations.

When other gods who possess sharp insight see that, they will announce to the former, “Alas, this is the kind of obstacle that confronts careless and thoughtless gods. At some point, their bodies can no longer be reflected on crystal or any other form. This is the exact same omen of a god’s death and transmigration that we have seen before.” That is the second cause of decline experienced by the gods in Making Use of Others’ Emanations.

Gods whose fortunes have not yet been exhausted have mansions made of many different blazing jewels within which they can travel anywhere in the three worlds. They travel through space just as they can journey on the ground. The goddesses can likewise journey, with undiminished strength. Nevertheless, when the merit of these otherwise imperishable gods is exhausted, they will no longer be able to ride their chariots, and they will sink into the water. They also can no longer go anywhere they please. When the other gods see their mansions, they will say, “This portends an approaching obstacle. Such decline is precisely what has accompanied the demise of other gods at the time of their death and transmigration.” When the gods whose merits are exhausted hear such words, they are seared by the mental torment of having to give up all their divine substances—it burns their bodies just as much as the fires in the hells. That is the third cause of decline for the gods in Making Use of Others’ Emanations. {{page:{number:1341,id:UT22084-068-021-101369,folio:F.129.a,volume:V70}}}

The gods whose former practice of positive actions is now becoming exhausted wear enchanting ornaments on their heads and four limbs. These ornaments normally produce melodious tunes and other delightful sounds that thoroughly uplift the mind. However, these sounds may change, as they are all produced by karmic actions. As the gods’ positive karmic actions are becoming exhausted, these insatiable corporeal beings chained by karmic actions must proceed to the next life. At that time, the sounds produced by the ornaments become highly unpleasant. Crushed by the objects, these gods now see their various ornaments and crowns fall to the ground due to the exhaustion of their karmic actions, and that sight causes them extreme distress.

They aim to benefit both themselves and others, express excellent virtue, and teach what is correct and beneficial for both. In this way, they practice exactly what they preach.

Whether one has heard about it from others or understood it on one’s own, when one in this way discerns the essence of the fruition of virtuous actions, one will understand reality. Such a practice is therefore referred to as understanding reality. As those with steadfast intelligence thus acquire extensive learning, they will not guide others in ways that are divorced from what is most essential. That is steadfast intelligence. One then relies on others who possess the same qualities and cannot be led astray by the teachings of others, even if these are presented as the Dharma.

Whether one is a householder or a monk, carelessness is avoided through mindfulness, and carefulness will ensure that one’s diligent pursuits are not in vain. With reasoning, diligence, and determination, one will be mindful and circumspect, and thereby maintain one’s carefulness. One’s five faculties will be protected from the five objects and there will be changes or relinquishment ensuing from that. This is because whenever the eye sees a form due to conditions, there will be no lustful desire. The nature of the objects will be seen. {{page:{number:1350,id:UT22084-068-021-101378,folio:F.133.b,volume:V70}}} They are seen to be rooted in conditions. The perception of form arising from causes will not be polluting, and the mental activity that arises from such perception will not lead one astray. Whether one is a layman, a monk, a god, or some other heavenly being, that perception will neither arouse lustful desire nor weaken one’s mindfulness and cause fondness for the objects of the māras. Rather, one will understand the fears that arise thereby. One will understand that such perception arises from flaws. By being mindful, one will understand that it also ceases. In any given setting, one will be mindful of the fact that the objects perceived by the visual consciousness occur due to a combination of causes and conditions. Thus, as the mental afflictions that emerge from longing for such objects arise, the strength of mindfulness will increase such that the afflictions are decisively overcome. When the objects that arise from causes and conditions produce intense desire and attachment, reliance on mindfulness will repeatedly overcome such afflictions. When one’s perception of form becomes overpowering, mindfulness will make one alarmed so that it is relinquished in various ways.

If their eyes should come to wander among the objects before them, their mindfulness will make them disengage by virtue of their practice. How do such people gain understanding based on practice with regard to mindfulness and lack of mindfulness?

Nor do they praise themselves or extol their own pure discipline. If they hear that the discipline of others is lacking in virtue, they will not inform donors and benefactors about that.

Others may experience truly desirable forms of ripening that are directly impelled by the three types of karmic action. Such ripening may be prompted by taking refuge in the Three Jewels, or by granting beings the gift of freedom from fear, the gift of the Dharma, and the like. The ripening may be prompted by a bright mind that has become extremely pure concerning the practice of positive actions. The ripening may also be due to wholesome actions that are performed, with a very pure attitude, toward one’s parents, or due to the practices of generosity, discipline, and insight. Such ripening may also be prompted by a sustained offering of medical treatment to those who have no doctor, medicine, or assistance, and who are sick, unprotected, destitute, and tormented by disease. Alternatively, it may be due to the relinquishment of killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, alcohol consumption, and so forth. It may also be prompted by the virtuous actions of providing ponds and springs for those who live in far-flung lands and wildernesses. Or it may be a result of the positive acts of worshiping the Three Jewels, prostrating, and joining one’s palms before them. Or it may be due to granting the gift of freedom from fear to those who face the terrors of fires, insects, killings, or weapons. {{page:{number:1366,id:UT22084-068-021-101394,folio:F.141.b,volume:V70}}} Or it may be due to providing solitary buddhas and worthy ones with dwellings, medical supplies, and utensils.

There is not a single being within the three realms that has not had to experience the karmic effects of hell, so obviously they can also be seen to head for all five realms of wandering beings. Although they are bound by the noose of past positive actions, such gods will still take birth in the seven great hells of Reviving, Black Line, Crushing, Howling, Great Howling, Heat, and Intense Heat. Gods do not take birth in Ultimate Torment because they lack the causes for doing so, yet they may indeed be born in the other seven hells. The gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three may take such birth either due to acts of killing to be experienced in other lives or acts of killing that they engaged in during the wars with the asuras. Killing and stealing can be found among all the gods who abide on the levels of action related to objects. While such acts are very common among the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings and the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, they also occur in the four remaining god realms. {{page:{number:1368,id:UT22084-068-021-101396,folio:F.142.b,volume:V70}}}

Surrounded by parks, wish-fulfilling trees, forests, and chariots, such gods may passionately pursue their pleasures within their mansions, insatiably partaking of the pleasures of objects. Yet, once their positive karmic actions are exhausted, they fall into the hells, bound by ropes of fire.

What are those causal factors? For gods who possess unwholesome karmic action, the unbearable intensity of their suffering of loss corresponds with the level of pleasure they achieved by means of objects. Karmic actions are unfathomable and extremely diverse. The elements in the physical constitution of the gods, such as their eyes, are extremely fresh and delicate, and so the intensity of their pain is also correspondingly strong. Compared to the gods of the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, this is even more the case with the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, and when they are forced to give up their realm, their mental terror is likewise much more severe.

While they suffer unimaginable mental anguish, their bodies too are bursting with pain. In this way, the gods of the realm of Moving in Gatherings see how the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three suffer horrendous downfalls into the realms of starving spirits.

Humans turn into other classes of beings, and thus may humans become gods, just as gods may become humans.

When the gods have seen these many different terrors of death and transmigration, they will set their sights elsewhere. They will now perceive upon the walls of the stūpa the way a Śakra ruler dies and transmigrates. While he previously wore bright garlands of supreme divine substances, enjoying indescribable pleasures of the five senses, he loses it all when he is driven onward by his own past karmic actions. He plunges headlong into the expanse of the lower realms of hell beings, starving spirits, or animals due to his own carelessness. All of this is due to his own past karmic actions.

The Śakra known as Prabhāvatī ruled as the king of the heavenly realm, yet once the merit of his own actions was exhausted, he was born as a crocodile in the ocean. When he was a human, he had been a bird trapper and killed many living beings. However, he had also prostrated to the Buddha and because of that he became a ruler. When that act was exhausted, he became an animal because of the remaining unwholesomeness associated with killing. When he was a ruler, he had offered donations to the sick, the helpless, and to monks with a mind of faith, and as a result of that, he became the ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife. {{page:{number:1372,id:UT22084-068-021-101400,folio:F.144.b,volume:V70}}} When those actions were exhausted, he was reborn as a lizard due to karmic actions to be experienced in other lives.

In other lives he had sold grains in remote regions in ways that were highly improper and deceptive. In this manner, he had willfully created great famines. Due to such causes, he was born in the Black Line Hell. Later, due to residual karmic actions, he became a starving spirit with a throat like a needle.

They will also see how his former positive actions had caused him to be born as Śakra. In a former life he addressed an extremely arrogant brahmin with wrong views in a friendly manner, and he offered him food and medicine. He also caused the brahmin to give up killing and to instead adhere to the bases of training. Due to such causes, conditions, and bases, he journeyed to the joyous higher realms upon the disintegration of his body and was thus born in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. {{page:{number:1373,id:UT22084-068-021-101401,folio:F.145.a,volume:V70}}} Later, when his positive karmic actions were depleted and exhausted, he was born into the womb of a pig.

He freed that man from the lion and nursed him for a long time, offering him food, drink, and healing. By such causes and conditions, he became the ruler known as Sumanyu.

He was teaching about suffering, that which causes the ripening of suffering, and the way suffering comes to an end for good.

Splendid became the ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife due to having previously listened to the sacred Dharma with great faith during the night of conquest, and because of having offered butter lamps to the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha.

When that body later disintegrated, he was therefore born in the hell of Intense Heat, experiencing hundreds of thousands of variations of pain resulting from actions associated with hell.

Seeing the actions that made him king of the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife, they will notice how he had often been a brahmin in the world of humans.

They will also see the karmic actions that made him take rebirth in that manner. When he was born as a human being, his mind was virtuous. He always praised and honored the gurus, and, with faith and respect, he conducted himself with consideration and humility. He would always sweep and anoint stūpas, perform his duties well, and faithfully offer gifts to mendicants and brahmins.

Those thirteen are obstacles for monks who practice concentration. They cause their downfall and make them unable to accomplish their own objectives. They lead to birth among hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. They make the monastic life pointless.

The minds of those who thrive on crowds are unrestrained; those who act without restraint will naturally become agitated, and thus their minds will constantly be thinking of things. Their minds will become habituated to an extremely distracted condition, buffeted by the waves of fluctuating thoughts. Those who become distracted in this way will take pleasure in shows and dances, and they will go to watch such entertaining spectacles and the like. They will thus become habituated to an unrestrained way of life as they make their way to cities, as well as to smaller places, towns, and villages. In constant fascination, they will go there as spectators. Those who go peering around where crowds are gathered will proceed to hook up with each other, and thus they will keep roving from place to place, traveling everywhere while being uncouth and delighting in speaking unvirtuous words.

Crowds produce many different sounds, and the profusion of attractive sounds can titillate the mind so that one becomes exceedingly attached to them. Taking constant delight in such sounds, one will find them tremendously captivating due to one’s overexcited state of mind. Such a tenacious mind has no faith and will not develop faith in anything meaningful. It will join religions that do not espouse the Dharma but will not have faith even in those.

They realize the sacred Dharma. They have natural, great respect for the buddhas and will behold the presence of those whom they should meet. Having escaped the world of crowds, they delight in one-pointedness and are deeply terrified by the horrors of cyclic existence. Moreover, their verbal endeavors bear fruit in the form of the four truths of noble beings. {{page:{number:1401,id:UT22084-068-021-101429,folio:F.159.a,volume:V70}}} That is, they speak the four truths of noble beings. Their physical endeavors bear fruit as they join their palms respectfully before the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha. And they also develop disenchantment with the body. Their mental endeavors bear fruit as they develop composure with respect to the particular and general characteristics of the mind.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3199,id:UT22084-068-021-5932}}}“ ‘This fruitful, threefold endeavor helps them enter the transcendence of suffering by means of all the methods that they have gained familiarity with. In this way, they are uninterested in crowds and do not keep unwholesome companions. Their minds are properly guarded, and their minds are also fully absorbed in equipoise. There are also three further factors that allow them to authentically transcend suffering. What are those three? Mindfulness of the breath, contemplating the repulsive, and discernment with respect to the elements. By these paths, anyone’s mind will enter equipoise.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3200,id:UT22084-068-021-5933}}}“ ‘Fondness for crowds prevents mental equipoise as well as the process of making the mind rest in equipoise, and it causes weariness regarding the three paths. It is a noose that drags one into the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. It keeps one chained to misfortune and makes people rush into the hells. Furthermore, the realms of starving spirits and animals result from the deceptions that attend fondness for crowds. Therefore, monks who practice composure give up crowds as if they were poison, weapons, fire, ferocious beasts, or an abyss. {{page:{number:1402,id:UT22084-068-021-101430,folio:F.159.b,volume:V70}}}

They are careless, and due to karmic actions that are to be experienced in other lives, they become miserable and penurious dancers, drummers, or singers who frequent the doors of other people’s homes, destitute and subsisting on handouts received by the wayside or in doorways. Therefore, crowds are virulent, like an encounter with a poisonous snake. Crowds are like a burning fire. Crowds are like falling into a pit. Crowds are ignorance and delusion. Crowds are lustful desire. Crowds are like a waterwheel. Crowds are witlessness. Crowds are like masses of darkness. Time and again, they block one’s success. They are the one disaster.

In this way, you must make your minds properly serviceable. Be free from all crowds. {{page:{number:1403,id:UT22084-068-021-101431,folio:F.160.a,volume:V70}}} Be free from attachments to visits and social gatherings among your own people, friends, and associates. Without becoming scattered, be happily alone. Keep your mind stable and focused, free from the four errors. Mindful of the sixteen modes of exhalation and inhalation, persevere diligently and correctly without discriminating between day and night. You will thereby free yourselves from the bonds of cyclic existence. With the attainment of that supreme stage comes a sublime happiness the likes of which you have never experienced before. And that is not the case for those who are drawn to crowds. Rather, such people lack learning, their minds are fickle, and their movements lack resolve. Without being mendicants, they declare themselves to be so, and they are lazy. Therefore, be sure to overcome that single factor, fondness for crowds.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3203,id:UT22084-068-021-5937}}}“ ‘What is the second factor that one should give up and refrain from? Acting as a doctor. That is an obstacle for monks who practice meditation, because if monks act as doctors, they will become engaged in extraneous activities and discussions. They will not offer their minds to the sick, but rather their minds will become absorbed in business. As they keep busy that way, their desires will grow very powerful. Subdued by desire, their minds will become very preoccupied and eventually, when various aggressive diseases occur, such people will take advantage of others. They will think, “Abundant wealth and respect are coming my way! Thus, I should now travel the land—from town to town, city to city, and from one dwelling to the next—so that I can accumulate wealth.” In this way, their greed will only increase, {{page:{number:1404,id:UT22084-068-021-101432,folio:F.160.b,volume:V70}}} and such people, being oppressed by greed, will propagate severe defilements—they will not be interested in the cultivation of equipoise. Neither will they practice virtuous actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3204,id:UT22084-068-021-5938}}}“ ‘There are additional great flaws associated with acting as a doctor. Someone who is not a monk but claims to be may, when someone is stricken with diseases associated with wind or the like, dispense medicine and advice and quickly produce a concoction of sesame oil. When the oil runs out, he will then grind more sesame seeds and thereby kill many beings as he exterminates a large quantity of insects.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3205,id:UT22084-068-021-5939}}}“ ‘There are other flaws as well. Bad mendicants who nevertheless declare themselves to be mendicants may prescribe meat to someone who is otherwise free from disease. In this way, they may order meat that is fresh—from animals killed by weapons, not very fatty, not obtained from dead animals, and neither from animals that were overcome by disease or contagion nor from animals afflicted by disease or contagion, nor from animals that died from poisoning, nor from animals that were killed by predators, nor from animals that became gaunt and emaciated. In this way, killings may result from their requisition. When that happens, both the one who asked for the slaying and the one who carried out the order will be equally complicit in the karmic action. Due to the flaws of covetousness and ill will, they will both be reborn in the Reviving Hell. Therefore, do not act as a doctor.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3206,id:UT22084-068-021-5940}}}“ ‘For bad mendicants who pretend to be mendicants but are demonic thieves, there are further flaws associated with acting as a doctor. For example, when certain violent diseases break out, such people may decide to travel from place to place, seeking out trees, creepers, and bushes in pursuit of wealth. {{page:{number:1405,id:UT22084-068-021-101433,folio:F.161.a,volume:V70}}} In such places, they may dig out and cut through colonies of insects and nests of worms in pursuit of wealth. As they dig, they catch the creatures that live in the bark and roots and destroy their nests. When they cut through the vegetation, they kill the insects that live in or from it. That is another flaw associated with acting as a doctor. How could people who pursue such an unwholesome means of livelihood, which is opposed to the Dharma, possibly become fond of meditation, since their minds are so filled with craving?
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3207,id:UT22084-068-021-5941}}}“ ‘Such unwholesome attitudes have other powerful flaws as well because with improper motivation, such people may take an inappropriate interest in the destruction of the land. They may think, “If calamities befall the land, people will venerate me, and thus I shall obtain possessions, food, drink, seats, dwellings, wealth, and honor.” Ruined by their desires, such people will not think of what is virtuous. Such people are also not inclined to cultivate equipoise, nor do they follow spiritual masters. They do not keep company with spiritual teachers, nor do they pay homage to the buddhas. When the bodies of such evildoers disintegrate, they fall into the lower realms and are reborn in the hells. If, following their death and transmigration, they should instead be born as a human due to virtuous karmic actions that are to be experienced in other lives, such negative doctors will, because of their actions, always suffer from illness and poverty and their lives will be cut short.

But people fail to recognize the factors that have been active since time without beginning, leading them to birth in the lower realms. Ordinary people who lack learning—bad mendicants who simply pretend to be mendicants—may cure destructible bodies, but they cannot cure the body of its primordial torments caused by desire, anger, and delusion. Those are the afflictions that one aims to relinquish by shaving off one’s hair and beard, donning the saffron-colored robes, and going forth. Whoever is burned by those will also be terribly scorched physically. Everything will be wasted and come to nothing. Whoever adheres to and chases after the three great flaws of desire, anger, and delusion will not, when the time comes to give up the present life and transmigrate to another, have achieved anything meaningful by having become a monk.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3209,id:UT22084-068-021-5943}}}“ ‘In their ignorance, people pursue unwholesome means of livelihood and are deceived by their own minds. For example, if those of inferior intellect, who lack support, companions, and wealth, encounter a powerful enemy, they will not be able to defeat that enemy, nor will they have any power to stop him. Rather, given that the enemy is stronger, they must instead follow him. Childish, ordinary beings who lack learning do not consider such an enemy to be frightening. Rather, they befriend him and together they make other weak beings who are afraid of their enemies subservient to them. With unwholesome mindfulness and misguided insight, such lazy and careless people get drunk and misbehave with the wives of others. {{page:{number:1407,id:UT22084-068-021-101435,folio:F.162.a,volume:V70}}} In that way, bad monks, who nevertheless declare themselves to be monks, befriend their own enemies. Their pursuit of what transcends the world—otherwise adhered to with great strength and abundant diligence—is thereby abandoned completely as they instead open the doors to desire, anger, and delusion and treat these afflictions as something delightful that one must indulge at all costs. While their bodies may be those of a monk, they give up the mindset that relinquished family, friends, and women, and instead they fall under the power of their enemies and keep company with them, motivated by material concerns.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3210,id:UT22084-068-021-5944}}}“ ‘In the same way that wind, gall, and phlegm are enemies, so you must understand that there are three enemies that disturb the mind and drive it toward the Lord of Death, three enemies that are hard to turn back: desire, anger, and delusion. Those three will bind you with the rope of desire, and thus you will, in total carelessness, be driven toward what lies beyond this world. Carelessness with respect to the supreme objective and strong craving for wealth make the mind suffer. Therefore, you must comprehend these flaws and not act as doctors. Someone who acts as a doctor of healing will not be happy in the lives to come.’

The causes of the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, and animals are very powerful. Hence, when such people see females, they are carried away by incorrect mental activity.

Without properly observing these spectacles, the tired and lazy artist of the mind, which does not have any familiarity with concentration, turns in its ignorance toward paintings that are different from its own life and pays full attention to them.

All such wonders of cyclic existence are indeed nothing to strive for. Yet unless those matters are kept in mind one will never become weary of them. Moreover, for as long as one practices equipoise, further miserable paintings will be created. Thus, mendicants are also scorched.

At such times, black paint is applied, resulting in birth among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. On the other hand, when the eyes see forms, one may instead think, “Those forms are impermanent and unstable, they are not immutable.

In this regard, if you recognize that “these sounds are unstable, impermanent, and subject to decay,” your consciousness will not become attached.

When birds are flying low, the sun may be eclipsed by a planet, or those who are free from desire may be seen throughout the land. Auspicious signs include gentle breezes, the land being spotless, or beautiful birds flying to the right in a circular movement. Inauspicious signs are redness at dawn and unpleasant colors throughout the land, fierce winds stirring, a blood-red dawn, or the risen sun shining in the sky with such an appearance. Such things bad mendicants—those who declare themselves mendicants—interpret as signs, and thus they encounter obstacles to the practice of concentration. They also explain such signs to the rulers of the land, and, for the sake of wealth and honor, they analyze them in terms of possible victories and defeats. Thereby, the king, who wishes to see such victories and defeats take place, will also give rise to desire, anger, and delusion. Rooted in ignorance, the three root afflictions overtake such people, who turn out to be neither mendicants nor householders.

At that time, when the kings berate one another, bad mendicants—those who pretend to be mendicants—may, in short, arrange large public gatherings of people. There, they will proceed to declare the occurrence of signs that a certain king will be victorious and another defeated.

Bad mendicants concern themselves with such mundane signs that hinder the practice of concentration. Good mendicants, on the other hand, demonstrate the supramundane signs of the faithful. What is an omen that occurs in an inauspicious way? What makes it inauspicious? It is the fading of the sacred Dharma. In this way, rough landscapes can be perceived where there are people who make the sacred Dharma fade through their fondness for harsh words, lying, divisive talk, killing, and stealing. Likewise, fierce winds stirring refers to harsh words. When the sacred Dharma fades, people lack the Dharma, and the winds of unpleasant words blow.

Monks shave off their hair and beards, don the saffron-colored robes, and faithfully go forth from the household to become homeless mendicants because they are frightened by the terrors of cyclic existence. Cyclic existence abounds with suffering, but in short there are two types: the aggregates, elements, and sense sources, and the three realms that are based on them. More elaborately, this involves the five classes of beings and, if described in even more detail, there are the eight realms of hell, the starving spirits, the animals, and the six classes of gods in the desire realm.

Moreover, at the time of death and transmigration, the body’s radiance is extinguished and, as the winds reach the body’s interiors, some unprecedented sensations will arise in the body. Thus, except for feelings that arise from the condition of contact associated with the eye, all sensations are certain to be felt as pleasurable. When a noble son learns about the way suffering arises from form, he will come to see all of cyclic existence as having the nature of suffering—a profusion of pain that is associated with the aggregates, elements, and sense sources—and with this perception of a constant and oppressive suffering in cyclic existence, he will decide to go forth.

In what other way do they transgress the bases of training? By stealing. They declare themselves endowed with insight, yet they are not suited to receiving the offerings of donors and benefactors.

They may then say, “Only I understand these words correctly, not all those venerable ones.” In this way, they deprecate the saṅgha. Afraid of not being heeded, such people may thus proceed to teach, but their teaching is not the sacred Dharma.

How does one lose sight of those observations, and how should one resettle one’s attention upon them?” When they thus fail to find the path, they feel a terrible sadness. Arising from their cross-legged posture, they think, {{page:{number:1457,id:UT22084-068-021-101485,folio:F.187.a,volume:V70}}} “All my plans have brought me nothing.” Distressed, they think, “There is no path here. No concentration. No attainments.” In this way, their pride and fear of being humbled cause them to denigrate the effects of concentration and absorption.

He will not curtail his time with friends but rather prolong it. The same applies when he hears sounds. He will not be in equipoise, he will fail to remain concentrated, and instead he will engage his mind in a way that lacks serenity. With such disturbed mental observations, he becomes exhausted and falls. In this way, paying visits to friends causes obstacles to his composure.

From the red trees also fall a rain of fresh flowers,{{note:{index:455,id:UT22084-068-021-6191}}} a shower that adorns the entire sky.

As they do so, some go to sit in the branches and celebrate there, in whichever way they please. Should they fancy a lotus pool among the branches, such a pool will immediately manifest the moment they wish for it, and they and their retinues will proceed to enjoy themselves and celebrate in the pool. In this way, infatuated and ecstatically enjoying all manner of pleasures, the gods and their retinues will mount the branches of the trees within the Red Forest.

Such buildings will be studded with bright jewels, draped with nets of bells, and adorned with lotus pools. Decorated with nets of pearls and bejeweled arches, they feature seats swathed in copious precious fabrics and abounding with lovely features. Within such gorgeous mansions, the gods will playfully assist one another in joyous celebration. Without any sense of mutual domination, the entire gathering is one of friends. {{page:{number:1471,id:UT22084-068-021-101499,folio:F.194.a,volume:V70}}} If, every so often, someone should be treated in an unfriendly way or as a stranger, that is because the karmic actions of that individual were extremely poor. This never occurs to those endowed with great karmic actions, and thus the vast majority enjoy the effects of positive actions. In this manner, the gods take delight as one great congregation as they frolic about within the Red Forest.

The splendor of the milk is such that when the gods drink it, they recollect their past lives. As they learn whence they came, having died and transmigrated, they will also understand, ‘If I now become careless, I will encounter much suffering in the future.’ In this way, they will come to feel tremendous distress, and, in their anguish, they will give up carelessness and instead begin living in accordance with the Dharma.

That is another omen that the merits of a god or goddess are becoming exhausted. When signs of the depletion of the merits of a given god or goddess manifest, the negative force of their carelessness will make the elephants stop paying heed to them.

They do not impart this lesson to each other, and, as they perceive things with the mindset of the gods, they will instead leave the lotus grove without talking.

In this way, the gods will keep exploring {{page:{number:1485,id:UT22084-068-021-101513,folio:F.201.a,volume:V70}}} Vast Garlands of Bliss, its majestic peaks, and its delightful surroundings. This triple-peaked mountain is far higher than any other in the Heaven Free from Strife.

They will then journey around Vast Garlands of Bliss and arrive at the back side of the mountain. There they will discover a gorgeous woodland lush with colorful trees that sparkle like jewels. Some of the trees have trunks of beryl that extend into canopies of golden leaves, others have gold and sapphire trunks and bear leaves of gold, and there are many additional stunning trees. In this way, on the back side of this mountain grow so-called pillar trees that have well-proportioned roots, trunks, branches, leaves, and canopies made of the seven precious substances. From their roots grow trunks of such precious materials. Some of the trunks are beryl and others are ruby, gold, crystal, coral, and karketana. The trunks and branches all display their own beautiful features—from their roots to their branches, leaves, and canopies, everything shines radiantly with the light of the seven precious substances. As soon as they see these pillar trees, the gods will go to frolic among them. {{page:{number:1486,id:UT22084-068-021-101514,folio:F.201.b,volume:V70}}}

As the gods approach the garland of mansions, they will find that they number in the hundreds of thousands. The mansions move and change size according to the gods’ wishes and they also yield whatever the gods may wish for. There are also lotus pools flush with lotus flowers on long stalks, and other sparkling lotus ponds that are adorned with gems. Around the flowers hover beautiful bees with bodies made of the seven precious substances. The birds inhabiting the region are distinguished in three ways. First, there are aquatic birds, such as swans, ducks, and geese.{{note:{index:461,id:UT22084-068-021-6251}}} Second, there are also birds inhabiting the dry land on the mountain’s back side, such as delightful speakers, that sing to each other and frolic continuously.{{note:{index:462,id:UT22084-068-021-6252}}} While the heavenly birds occupying dry land sing in this way, the calls of peacocks can also be heard. Third, the heavenly birds living in the forest include pheasants, peacocks, yakṣiṭa, all seers, ever-open eyes, roamers, truth speakers, and constant speakers. In this way, birds associated with the realms of both humans and gods can be heard singing in many delightful ways while frolicking in the forest.

Careless and enraptured by objects, they will continue to enjoy themselves and celebrate until finally their completed and accumulated virtuous actions have been exhausted. Then, it is only a matter of time before they die and transmigrate from their divine world. Once that happens, they will, in accordance with their karmic actions, be born in the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. Should they instead be born with the general lot in life of a human they will, due to karmic actions to be experienced in other lives, be perfectly happy and possess vast intelligence. With their extremely joyous minds, they may also be born among the gods who are fond of frolicking or those who are filled with joy. Alternatively, they may be born among the wealthy people on Suvarṇadvīpa or Siṃhala, or they may become householders according to their karmic actions.”

As for giving up sexual misconduct, such people will give up reminiscing about females they knew in the past. Upon the disintegration of their bodies, such virtuous and disciplined people with pure and well-trained minds will go to the joyous higher realms and be born among the gods in Endowed with Migration within the Heaven Free from Strife.

Happily playing to the tunes of the five types of instruments, they will become infatuated with all the incomparable sounds, textures, tastes, forms, and smells. Like the ceaseless descent of five rivers into a lake, their five cravings associated with the five senses continuously flow into the lower realms without ever pausing for a single day, and yet their senses are never satisfied. {{page:{number:1489,id:UT22084-068-021-101517,folio:F.203.a,volume:V70}}} Like five bonfires fanned by the wind—five ferocious mountains of fire that continuously grow the more firewood they are fed—their senses constantly crave, and they are fanned by the winds of thinking. The firewood of the objects is lit upon the mountaintops of their incorrect mental engagements, and so the fires of their craving five senses burn even stronger. The more firewood of objects this fire is fed, the more intense it becomes. Like moths plunging into a flame, those who are filled with craving all fall into the fire of objects and die. In this way, all such craving beings are just like moths. Yet, they do not understand this.

Those among the gods whose karmic actions are of the most inferior kind still wear full ornaments and apparel and are followed by a retinue of ten thousand. Accordingly, other gods are attended by thirty-two thousand, others by forty thousand, still others by fifty thousand, and so on, up to a hundred thousand attending gods. No one in the retinue ever becomes weary, and, consequently, whenever a god makes love to a goddess, every goddess will tell herself, ‘I must make sure that this god finds nothing but pleasure with me!’ In this way, the gods spend their time in insatiable sensual craving. Glowing with mutual affection, they never have enough. Careless and passionate, they enjoy themselves in the forests and parks among the ponds, trees, bushes, rivers, and pools. There is no group of gods that is not attended by goddesses.

Some have mixed plumage, displaying all the bright colors of the seven precious substances. Some display colors of silver, crystal, gold, coral, and karketana. Thus, in accordance with the karmic actions created by the mind, these swans sport a great variety of splendid colors. They also frolic with female swans similarly adorned with feathers of the most gorgeous colors. The swans play in the waves of the lakes and in the pools and lotus groves into which flow cascading waters from the mountains. They also enjoy themselves in flower meadows where the ground yields to their steps and bounces back when they lift their feet. The swans enjoy themselves together in many ways, just like the gods. Together with their throngs of beautiful goddesses, the gods will enter among the swans of the forest. As they see the swans, they are struck with wonder and become overjoyed. Thus, they begin to explore the area, letting their eyes wander everywhere. {{page:{number:1492,id:UT22084-068-021-101520,folio:F.204.b,volume:V70}}}

He is to the swans what Musulundha is to the gods of the Heaven Free from Strife. He frolics, celebrates, and enjoys himself within the lotus pool called Utter Vastness. Even Musulundha, ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife, comes to see him there. He and the great bird then enjoy themselves and celebrate together in a way that no one else in the divine congregations can fathom. Nor does anyone among the assembled gods know the reason why such great mutual joy exists between Auspicious Time and Musulundha.

The herd leaders display numerous beautiful colors, and the different species of animals all live together happily, partaking of delicious food. Enjoying the divine grasses in the heavenly forest, the deer, which are beautified by the seven precious substances, frolic and call within the jungle, on the banks of the rivers and lotus pools, among the ponds and flatlands, and within the crannies of the mountains.

Some of the birds make melodious calls while others display their plumage to each other as they play and dance about. Other birds can be seen sitting individually in giant trees, {{page:{number:1494,id:UT22084-068-021-101522,folio:F.205.b,volume:V70}}} where they play within the foliage, where their luxuriant plumage displays the colors of the seven precious substances.

The difference between them is like that between the pleasures of humans and the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, or the difference between the Heaven of the Four Great Kings and the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. Just as the objects in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings differ from those in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three due to the higher levels of pleasure found in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, and because of those gods’ exalted karmic actions, the qualities of the divine objects that pertain to all six classes of gods in the Desire Realm become progressively more glorious. The gods are endowed with abundant pleasures for which there are simply no examples.

{{milestone:{label:4.C.3571,id:UT22084-068-021-6349}}}“ ‘First, the careless who act carelessly may in their distraction say one thing while thinking another. Such people are useless in their activities, which are without meaning. They confuse the order of things, and they cannot focus their minds on anything. Why is that? Because carelessness makes their distracted minds unable to understand. They wonder, “What shall I say, how shall I say it, and to whom shall I speak?” In this way, their minds remain distracted and unstable, no matter who they are speaking to. They are fickle, gullible, and make for unpleasant company. Others will rebuke them and, like grass in the wind, they bow to everyone. Such is the first among the flaws that bind the careless and lead them to birth in any of the three lower realms. This is the first flaw of the careless. {{page:{number:1508,id:UT22084-068-021-101536,folio:F.212.b,volume:V70}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3572,id:UT22084-068-021-6350}}} “ ‘There is also a second flaw of carelessness. What is that? Not knowing what is needed and what is not needed. Those whose minds are spoiled by carelessness do not understand that. They wonder, “What constitutes a good action? And which actions should one refrain from? What effects ripen from such actions?” In this way, they comprehend neither karmic actions nor their ripening. They are deluded about karmic actions and their effects and, when their bodies disintegrate, the flaws of their carelessness will make them suffer an inauspicious fall into the lower realms, where they are born in the hells.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3573,id:UT22084-068-021-6351}}} “ ‘There is also a third flaw of carelessness, which both gods and humans swayed by carelessness suffer from: keeping company with wicked friends, that is to say, companions who do not serve the Three Jewels, who are not pursuing insight and discipline, who do not follow spiritual masters, who do not understand the difference between good qualities and flaws, who fail to understand the suffering of cyclic existence, who fail to understand the character of diverse karmic actions, and who are disinclined to give up sleep and muster diligence in the evening and early morning. When such people die, the flaws of their carelessness will make them suffer an inauspicious fall into the lower realms, and they shall be born in hell.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3574,id:UT22084-068-021-6352}}} “ ‘There is also a fourth flaw of carelessness. What is that? For humans and gods who are born in this way, there comes a point at which the formations for their lives and their positive karmic actions are exhausted. That is the point at which the Lord of Death arrives and all the things that those careless beings have relied on will be taken from them. They will simultaneously lose four things. What are they? Youth, health, life force, and fine circumstances. {{page:{number:1509,id:UT22084-068-021-101537,folio:F.213.a,volume:V70}}} Those four must be abandoned all at once. Even the learned cannot extend them, and the careless certainly cannot hold on to them. Since carelessness is one’s enemy, one should never indulge in it. Anyone taken in by carelessness, be they gods or humans, will be destroyed. Therefore, it must be relinquished.

Putting one’s trust in a source of terror—and there is no greater source of terror and no one more untrustworthy than women. Still, miserable people who are swayed by carelessness place their trust in women. Moreover, whenever there are some that they do not trust, they will hide that in their heart for as long as they are alive. Just as fire is always hot, women are born with minds that are flawed by pretense, craving, deceit, offensiveness, pride, disgracefulness, and ingratitude. And still, those miserable people that are carried away by carelessness are overcome merely by the words of women, and thus they put their trust in them. When that happens, they develop yearning and their minds become aroused.

{{milestone:{label:4.C.3580,id:UT22084-068-021-6359}}} “ ‘Those who give up carelessness and practice carefulness also possess a third quality. What is that? Not falling under the sway of women, even at the cost of their lives. Such people will not trust the words of women. They always take into account the nature of women. Women are a source of bondage in this world as well as the next, and, with that understanding, such people do not allow the appearance of women to confuse them and do not place any trust in what they say. Their understanding is in perfect accordance with reality and they are not led astray by the dances, songs, poses, or ornaments of women.

They also encourage others to practice such relinquishment and carefulness.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3581,id:UT22084-068-021-6360}}}“ ‘There is also a fourth quality of carefulness. What is that? Those who are careful are not concerned with enjoyments or pleasures. Every once in a rare while, they may take some satisfaction from pleasures, but they do not constantly think about pleasures, or concern themselves with them, because pleasures are in no way permanent, reliable, or trustworthy. Rather, they lead to decline and are subject to imminent destruction. Similarly, the careful do not put their trust in good health because those who are free from disease are all eventually overcome by illness. Neither do they place any trust in youth because youth is always conquered by aging. Hence, they do not try to maintain their youthfulness and do not develop any conceit based on youth. Likewise, they do not work at staying alive, nor do they become excited or go through hardships to stay alive. Why not? Because the Lord of Death is going to take the lives of everyone. Hence, those who practice carefulness do not indulge in such things. They do not become careless with regard to conditioned phenomena.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3582,id:UT22084-068-021-6361}}}“ ‘Those who carefully practice carefulness also possess another set of five qualities. What are they? Learning, following noble beings, delighting in wakefulness, respecting the Three Jewels, and developing skill in discerning the subject matter they learn. Hence, they remain aware of the time of the Lord of Death. They also recognize the marks of suffering and death. They comprehend the signs of a god’s death and transmigration on the basis of what they have heard. {{page:{number:1512,id:UT22084-068-021-101540,folio:F.214.b,volume:V70}}} They understand the omens of a person’s impending death and passage to the lower realms and thereby recognize that they too are heading for the lower realms. They also understand what is to be done. They develop strong faith. As soon as such a frame of mind arises, the signs of going to the lower realms fade and instead signs of going to the higher realms appear.

{{milestone:{label:4.C.3595,id:UT22084-068-021-6375}}}“ ‘The fifth remedy for carelessness is this: witnessing how those who are flawed by carelessness are punished by kings or royal ministers. Seeing how such people are punished with execution, having their property confiscated, mutilation, or amputation due to their carelessness, one becomes apprehensive of other forms of carelessness. The very presence of such fear makes one give up all stains of carelessness, and so one will overcome carelessness and practice carefulness. Considering this, one will think, “May I not be born in hell!” and thus abstain from unvirtuous actions. Still, those gods who are so fond of carelessness continue to engage in unwholesome actions. But this is the fifth remedy for carelessness. In this way, carelessness is not becoming, either for gods nor humans.’
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3596,id:UT22084-068-021-6376}}}“Upon hearing this discourse, many gods will become totally disenchanted and give up carelessness. Filled with appreciation and delight for the explanation of the king of the garuḍas, Musulundha will then return with his divine retinue, ascending into the sky in the same manner that he arrived. Some of the remaining gods will go back to playing within Vastness, whereas other gods will return to frolicking in the forests and parks. In this way, they will continue to play and enjoy themselves within that heavenly realm until their completed and accumulated positive acts with desirable, attractive, and delightful consequences have finally been exhausted. Once that happens, they will die and leave their divine world, {{page:{number:1515,id:UT22084-068-021-101543,folio:F.216.a,volume:V70}}} only to take birth among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals, in accordance with their karmic actions. Should some of them instead be born with the general lot in life of a human, they will be tremendously happy. In accordance with their karmic actions, they will maintain their livelihood with sincerity and insight, they will be favored by the king, and they will possess great prosperity.”

The Gods in Emanation of Light Rays
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3598,id:UT22084-068-021-6379}}}“As the monk who has knowledge of the effects of the ripening of karmic actions continues to examine the realms of the Heaven Free from Strife, he will by means of knowledge derived from hearing accurately perceive a realm known as Emanation of Light Rays.{{note:{index:476,id:UT22084-068-021-6380}}} Wondering what karmic actions cause beings to take birth there, he will perceive the way some holy people are endowed with learning and discipline, in possession of the supreme right view, completely free from animosity, and honest and sincere. Such people may give up killing and stealing in the same way as before. They may also give up sexual misconduct, such that they, out of fear of sexual misconduct, do not regard women with even the slightest inappropriate form of mental engagement. Their karmic actions, means of livelihood, and modes of conduct are therefore all extremely pure. When the bodies of such people disintegrate, they journey to the joyous higher realms and are born in the divine world of Emanation of Light Rays.

Infatuated by the five sense pleasures, which manifest due to their former pure conduct, they will fall under the power of the six sense faculties. When these careless beings then begin to investigate the forests and parks, they will soon discover many further divine pleasures, and thus they will begin to wander carelessly, consumed by the urge to pursue those divine objects. {{page:{number:1516,id:UT22084-068-021-101544,folio:F.216.b,volume:V70}}}

The ground is soft yet brilliantly studded with the seven precious substances, providing an extremely enjoyable surface, and the trees that grow there have a texture that feels just the same as the ground. Hence, when the gods climb the trees, they feel extremely smooth and soft textures, and the trees’ leaves and fruits, which are made of gold from the Jambu River, provide the gods with food of any taste, fragrance, and color they may desire. Likewise, a god may think, ‘I wish the fruits would yield such and such a supreme drink of perfectly exquisite taste, color, and texture.’ This will then occur at that very moment, and from the excellent fruits will flow delicious and colorful drinks of unprecedented quality. The gods will then proffer their jewel chalices and enjoy these drinks together with the goddesses. The color, taste, and fragrance of the drinks come in inferior, intermediate, and superior variants, depending on the gods’ unique karmic backgrounds. The particular quality of their former positive actions manifests in the taste of the fruits they enjoy.

Burned by their restless gaze, they will proceed on a great tour of the forests and parks while dancing, singing, joking, and fooling around with each other. Wherever they go, they encounter a profusion of unparalleled forms of divine substance. They also enjoy the various types of tastes that appear to them and thereby experience numerous varieties of delicious tastes. Similarly, all the smells that they register are enchanting, and thus they enjoy a diverse array of beautiful fragrances. {{page:{number:1517,id:UT22084-068-021-101545,folio:F.217.a,volume:V70}}} The textures they feel are also just as they may please, and so the gods touch an array of supremely delightful textures that are all strictly in accordance with their wishes. The many different sounds they hear are also all agreeable and in accordance with their wishes. In this way, the gods will enjoy the effects of their supremely virtuous discipline as they experience the most exquisite five kinds of objects. Moving about with their minds lost in such games, for a long time they will be insatiable with respect to their pleasurable objects.

Many hundreds of thousands of trees grow within it, and this forest is also adorned with many parks. The joys of the Forest of Joy are as follows. The roots, branches, and twigs are all different. Thus, one part of the forest has a brilliantly white color and radiance. Due to its colors and hues, that area is given the name Forest of Silver Trees. It illumines the environment with a shining light that resembles the rays of the full moon in Jambudvīpa. Each of the trees in this forest shines with such a light. The forest appears more delightful than any other object, and thus it is enchanting even to eyes that are accustomed to joyous sights. Another part of the forest is gorgeous like karketana. Everything there has a supreme red color and shines with a light of the same gorgeous hue. Red birds sing happily among the red leaves, and all the many different parts of the forest illumine the sky with their radiant red light. {{page:{number:1518,id:UT22084-068-021-101546,folio:F.217.b,volume:V70}}} In a third part of the forest, everything is of the same blue color, and there the forest also shines with an exceptional brilliance. A deep blue, sparkling light illumines the entire environment. This light also lends a gorgeous blue color to the sky, illumining the atmosphere with a beryl color like that of the sky above Jambudvīpa. Still, nothing is more magnificent within the Forest of Joy than the park of crystal that shines with the most dazzling light. The trees in that park are enormous with their spreading roots, leaves, branches, and twigs. The park also contains many exquisite streams, cascades, and ponds. Another splendid section of the forest is lush with sapphire trees. The entire woodland—with its roots, branches, leaves, and anthers—possesses a beautiful blue color. There are many enchanting vines, the forest is full of birds that sing lovely, captivating songs, and there are also gorgeous lotus pools.

Resplendent with its many special features, this vine-clad king of forests thus manifests as an abode of tremendous joy. Hundreds of throngs of gods visit there again and again to enjoy themselves among the vines, houses, lotus pools, riverbanks, waterfalls, groves, and glades. There the gods sing, dance, joke, and strike poses while their jewelry rings out in captivating ways and their songs fill the forest. The flowers in the forest sway to please the gods; as the breeze stirs the flowers, these floral ornaments move as if they were dancing. Such are the brilliant features of this most special place.

Among some mandārava trees in the center of the pool resides the peafowl king known as Resplendent. His feathers are adorned with seven brilliant circles and the enchanting tones of his voice fill the forest.

The peafowl king Resplendent is filled with supremely virtuous thoughts and has taken birth into this heavenly realm by the power of his aspirations. Rather than speaking of divine substances, he illustrates his words with examples that those who have been humans will have seen. Those among the gods who succeed in hearing a bit of what he says will, as they take it in, remember their past lives. When they then recollect the effects of karmic actions, they will keep them in mind and no longer be completely absorbed in the pursuit of pleasures.

Some birds with very colorful feathers will arrive from other forests, carrying blooming vines in their beaks as they journey to Flower Homes. Male and female swans living in other forests will, upon hearing the singing, help each other pick up jewel garlands and carry them, and thus they fly through the sky adorned by brightly colored lights and land in Flower Homes.

Among its trees, which are adorned with the seven precious substances so that they resemble a blazing light, they will see many different birds and hear their delightful singing. What they hear are the most delightful songs that continue as long as the gods listen to them—a ravishing, diverse, and unfailing symphony that gratifies all the gods. That is how the birds sing as they move among the trees, lotus pools, flowers, and ponds in the forest. As they hear this great lushness of tones, the enchanted gods will no longer pay any attention to the chorusing of the goddesses and instead will listen exclusively to the singing of the birds, which only grows all the more enrapturing the longer they listen. Resounding from the mountaintops, the tunes of the birds fill the environment. When the deer inhabiting distant mountains hear the singing, they respond with their natural fondness for song, coming in herds of hundreds, if not thousands. Some come with their eyes and ears fixed in unwavering attention. Some listen from within their own forests. Some leave their abundant lotus flowers and instead come to listen to the songs. Such is the lovely singing of the birds within the forest of Joyous Birdsong. {{page:{number:1531,id:UT22084-068-021-101559,folio:F.224.a,volume:V70}}}

The mountain peaks are draped in nets of vines and feature many shining mansions made of the seven precious substances. Their walls are richly adorned with fine murals with numerous motifs—the mansions and their walls are thus beautifully embellished. With such opulent adornments, in addition to the other exceptional splendors of the forest, the whole area shines brightly. Moreover, the characteristics of the many perfect qualities of the woodlands and parks have already been explained. Another delight of that mountain is its beryl mines, {{page:{number:1532,id:UT22084-068-021-101560,folio:F.224.b,volume:V70}}} which yield sevenfold qualities of the most exquisite kinds—a perfect array of desirable sounds, textures, and tastes that manifest in superb richness.

Obscured by objects, they therefore ignore the birds and instead they are swallowed up by their fascination with all the objects, unable to escape the jungle of craving. Accordingly, they are struck by torturous consequences, falling into the hands of the enemy horde of lustful desires.

The birds are infinitely ravishing to behold and extremely captivating to listen to. Their decorative ornaments produce a radiant glimmer that lends them a unique beauty.

Lavish and diverse, the great avian concert is continuous and uninterrupted. As the voices of the birds keep chorusing in ways that are utterly sublime, the gods take it all in with immense desire. The gods will gather and listen with great delight for a very long time before finally their enormous craving makes them look for nectar to drink. At that point, they will notice heavenly streams of superb taste and aroma flowing among the cavernous mountains in their divine world, adorned by swarms of bees, and so they begin to drink from those streams. {{page:{number:1534,id:UT22084-068-021-101562,folio:F.225.b,volume:V70}}}

This lofty mountain is a brilliant source of pleasure for the six sense faculties of the gods as they approach, tormented by lustful craving. They sing and dance, drape themselves in lotus garlands, and enjoy themselves in ecstatic infatuation, constantly enraptured by the five objects and desirously indulging in their joyful attractions. They will move ahead—scorched in the five fires and caught in the muck of craving—and in that way they will reach the heights of that mountain. Yearning for objects, they are eager to explore the mountain, and thus they begin scaling this massif, which is a haven of copious joys.

Due to their past virtuous actions, some are exceedingly splendid and absolutely enchanting—adorned with beautiful jewelry and raiment, youthful, passionate, flirtatious, singing, and dancing—and thus they will cavort passionately together.

However, in the case of those who have not properly given up sexual misconduct, their goddesses will abandon them. In this way, the various individual actions yield distinct ripening. This is how observing, relying on, cultivating, and increasing positive physical actions lead to rebirth among the gods.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3805,id:UT22084-068-021-6608}}}“ ‘There is also a second set of factors, divided into four, that involves enjoyable ripening. When practiced, cultivated, and increased, this also leads to birth among the gods. What are those actions that lead to the enjoyments of birth among the gods as they ripen? They are the four types of proper verbal restraint. Having given up lying, one’s voice will be clear, pleasant, and deep. One will always be a highly successful speaker such that whatever one says it is articulated with ease yet captures the subject matter accurately. Such is the situation for these gods, and this is due to the force of having properly relinquished lying. Next, the relinquishment of divisive talk prevents the destruction of one’s realm. {{page:{number:1595,id:UT22084-068-021-101623,folio:F.256.a,volume:V70}}} Having permanently given up divisive talk, one will always hear exquisite sounds that are enchanting to the ears as well as the mind—sounds of singing, dancing, excitement, and rapture. Giving up irrelevant talk results in having a tongue that is well proportioned and delicate.{{note:{index:496,id:UT22084-068-021-6609}}} One will be a delight to all the gods. Such are the enjoyments of the effects of virtuous actions of speech.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3806,id:UT22084-068-021-6610}}}“ ‘What are the divine mental actions that bring effects experienced in the heavens? By giving up covetousness, all that one desires will be obtained simply by thinking of it, what one acquires will not decay, and other gods will not want to partake of it. Such are the effects experienced by those who give up covetousness, and such ripening is not due to anything else. By giving up ill will, one will be in harmony with everyone else in the heavens. One will also be endowed with an outstanding body. By giving up wrong views, no non-Buddhist will venture into any dispute with you. All events will turn out in perfect accordance with one’s wishes, not in any other way. Never will there be the slightest lack of anything that one wishes for. This is a brief explanation of the ripening of the ten virtuous courses of action.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3807,id:UT22084-068-021-6611}}}“ ‘Generosity specifically yields special wealth, while insight specifically makes everything uniquely outstanding. The reason for this is that all joys are rooted in insight. All that is not enjoyable is preceded by the delusion of existence. {{page:{number:1596,id:UT22084-068-021-101624,folio:F.256.b,volume:V70}}} Depending on the mind, time, entities, and one’s good motivation, even just one among the virtuous courses of action can lead to birth as a god. Since they even propel one toward the transcendence of suffering, it goes without saying that such actions can also lead to birth among the gods.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3808,id:UT22084-068-021-6612}}}“ ‘Yet, the ripening of karmic actions is extremely subtle. The ignorant are therefore unaware of the ripening of karmic actions and thus, in their delusion, end up rushing toward the hells.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3809,id:UT22084-068-021-6613}}}“ ‘When a king practices these ten virtuous courses of action as just explained, all of his lands and cities will abide by his rule. When the king’s body disintegrates, the ripening of these acts will after his death make him go to the joyous higher realms and become ruler of the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3810,id:UT22084-068-021-6614}}}“ ‘There is also another quality that a king should cultivate. What is that? Proper consideration of cause and effect. A king or minister who has proper awareness of cause and effect will not be deluded. His mind will remain composed in recognition of karmic actions and their ripening, and he will not engage with objects carelessly. Here cause is like the seed of a fruit. Conditions are like the passing of the seasons and the proper soil. Those who do not disregard causes or conditions will perceive the reality of cause and effect. Such people do not engage in unwholesome actions. As with the combination of causes and conditions pertaining to a seed and its sprout, one will be free from delusion regarding karmic actions and the ripening of their effects. {{page:{number:1597,id:UT22084-068-021-101625,folio:F.257.a,volume:V70}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3811,id:UT22084-068-021-6615}}}“ ‘Both virtuous and unvirtuous actions constitute the path of rebirth. Those actions give rise to the many different forms of pleasure and pain that are encountered in cyclic existence. The continua of living beings are formed by such actions, and that conditioning keeps them confined to the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, and animals, or the realms of gods and humans. In this way, the three realms are produced by virtuous, unvirtuous, and immovable actions. That is to say, life as a god or human is caused by the conditioning of virtuous actions, unvirtuous actions lead to the hells, and immovable actions lead to the form and formless realms. When a king truly sees the mere causes of life in those three realms, he will no longer be deluded within the wilderness of cyclic existence. In short, therefore, all these conditioned factors are causes and effects. A king who perceives causes and effects will not be brought down by flaws. He will not engage in any unvirtuous actions, influenced by the terrifying horrors of misdeeds. Rather, he will constantly engage in what is virtuous. Upon the disintegration of his body, he will go the joyous higher realms and be born in the world of the gods. The foremost way to engage the mind is known as proper consideration of conditions. Therefore, this must be kept in mind by a king who perseveres in these teachings. This is the way of proper awareness of causes and conditions.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3812,id:UT22084-068-021-6616}}}“ ‘There is also another factor that a king should diligently pursue in various ways. What is that? Worshiping the gods. Gods that engage in the conduct of positive actions will voluntarily assist in one’s own practice of positive actions, and they will prevent any obstacles to the manifestation of virtuous qualities. {{page:{number:1598,id:UT22084-068-021-101626,folio:F.257.b,volume:V70}}} Those who worship such gods during both day and night will receive their assistance. The gods will even reveal good and bad omens in one’s dreams. They will protect the realm from destruction and constantly inspire people toward virtuous actions. Those who practice accordingly will be protected day and night. It is therefore only appropriate to worship virtuous gods in various ways, as if they were one’s father or mother.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3813,id:UT22084-068-021-6617}}}“ ‘Hence, a king should always worship the gods. He should do so by means of a ritual that accords with the Dharma and without any involvement in negative actions due to desire or specific precepts. He should do so without causing harm{{note:{index:497,id:UT22084-068-021-6618}}} and without taking any oath based on wrong views. He should worship the gods in a way that is disengaged from the causes and the mindset that create the karmic actions and sufferings of all beings. Due to the quality of the divine assistance he receives, a king who worships in this way will never fail in his objectives. He will never disregard cause and effect. He will not develop wrong views. He will offer constant worship. When his body disintegrates, the causes and conditions associated with such actions will make him go to the joyous higher realms and be born as the king of the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3814,id:UT22084-068-021-6619}}}“ ‘There is also another quality that a king should cultivate. What is that? Sustaining the people. A king who truly sustains his people will observe and follow the Dharma and will grant his people freedom from fear, as if he were their mother or father. As he grants them freedom from all fears, a river of virtuous qualities will flow and increase throughout day and night. {{page:{number:1599,id:UT22084-068-021-101627,folio:F.258.a,volume:V70}}} The inhabitants of his cities will regard him with fondness and affection and will therefore provide him with wealth and praise.

As his rule expands, the harvests will be bountiful and the population will flourish. As the cities thrive, the king himself will also prosper. A king who sustains the populace in this way will always be righteous, wealthy, and famous. Such an excellent being will continue to nourish his subjects. Since he always wishes to benefit people and is free from ill will and covetousness, he will upon the destruction of his body go to the joyous higher realms and become the ruler of the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife. Such is the power of the causes and conditions he created in the past.

Providing his sons and daughters with happiness. A king or royal minister who provides his sons and daughters with happiness brings about a continuous increase in many forms of merit. Regardless of his situation, circumstances, or possessions, he will give everything to them whenever he has something to give. {{page:{number:1600,id:UT22084-068-021-101628,folio:F.258.b,volume:V70}}} In this way, he enthusiastically provides them with material things, food, drink, and clothing. He will embrace them, speak pleasantly, and make them feel confident, joyful, and fearless. Great merits will blossom from his sons and daughters, and when such great merits emerge from his home in a wide variety of ways, that is what is known as taking good care of one’s children.

As he provides them material things and protects them from violence, they will excel in his presence. Therefore, those who cannot faithfully take ordination should sincerely care for their children. People who have the resources but are so miserly that they do not care for their children according to their means are neither householders nor monks. Therefore, a king or royal minister should take care of his children by giving them material gifts while also instilling in them a sense of discipline. He should establish his sons and daughters in discipline, encourage their practice of generosity, and help them cultivate insight. While sustaining and raising his children in genuine happiness, he should continuously provide for them according to his capacity. In this way a king or royal minister will sustain his children and bring them lasting happiness. When later his body disintegrates, he will go to the joyous higher realms and become the ruler of the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife. Such is the force of those causes and conditions.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3818,id:UT22084-068-021-6623}}}“ ‘There is also another factor that a king should pursue diligently and in numerous ways. He must cultivate insight by all means. Cultivating insight {{page:{number:1601,id:UT22084-068-021-101629,folio:F.259.a,volume:V70}}} destroys all suffering and is the cause of deliverance from cyclic existence. Hence, a king must by all means train in that. Insight is the lamp for those who have fallen into the great darkness of cyclic existence and are lost in the darkness of numerous sufferings. It is a jewel for the destitute in cyclic existence, an eye for the blind, strength for the powerless, a friend of the friendless, a protector of the exposed, a medicine for those tormented by disease, a guide for those without a path, a cooling rain for those tormented by craving in the wilderness of cyclic existence, the cause of deliverance for those bound in the prison of cyclic existence, a helping friend for those who have none, clear vision for those who are blinded, and a powerful friend at the time and place of one’s execution. When the henchmen of the Lord of Death are near and death is approaching, insight is a powerful friend who leads one away from the terrors of the lower realms. Insight is a friend who takes one by the hand and saves one from treacherous passes and chasms, leading one toward all types of happiness. For those scorched by the sun, insight is a priceless garment. For those tormented by the terrifying heat of flawed discipline, insight is like the cool shade of a tree with many great branches and a dense canopy of twigs, shoots, leaves, and flowers {{page:{number:1602,id:UT22084-068-021-101630,folio:F.259.b,volume:V70}}} that brings joy to everyone who sees or touches it.

Insight exclusively possesses such qualities, and by correctly cultivating this knowledge, one comes to realize the true path. By carefully discerning things and keeping insight in mind, one will eventually actualize its qualities. One must develop decisive certainty and extensive knowledge. Insight paints beautiful scenes throughout the beginning, middle, and end. Insight reveals the path of reality. It reveals the city of the transcendence of suffering, free from attachments to any desired objective. Insight should always be cultivated.

As he fails in all these regards, opposing kings will be able to damage him. When that happens, the people in his cities will become displeased with him, and thus the king may lose his realm. He will descend into great suffering and may even lose his life. Therefore, one should not become obsessed with objects. A king who is not obsessed with objects, who rules in accordance with the Dharma, and who is even-minded cannot be led astray by sounds, textures, tastes, forms, or smells.

He will not crave for things but be content with what his own karmic actions provide. In his lands, the gods will not bring untimely rains, the sun will not burn out of season, no famine will occur, and there will be no armed struggles.

The other gods present there will continue frolicking among the thousands of summits of Mountainous Garland. Deluded by the poison of carelessness and destroyed by their craving for objects, they will go on celebrating with one another among the forests, parks, ponds, lotus groves, lakes, and forests of wish-fulfilling trees. Revelling to music of the five types of instruments, they will indulge in rivers of food and drink that are beyond compare. Constantly playing among the flowers, fruits, and birds that sing in the most exquisite ways, the gods will enjoy the pleasures that are manifested by their own karmic actions. All this continues until their completed and accumulated actions with delightful consequences have finally been exhausted. Once that happens, they will, in accordance with their karmic actions, take birth among hell beings, starving spirits, or animals. Those who are instead born as humans and are endowed with the general lot in life of a human will be extremely happy. Living by the sea or near waterfalls, they will become merchants or courageous kings. They will not personally have to ply the seas but will be exceedingly wealthy.

They understand that it is wrong to think, ‘Ah, what an attractive and desirous woman. This lady is an outstanding beauty; her figure is utterly delightful!’ They know that maintaining such desirous mind states will consume the mind. With that understanding, they fully relinquish the suffering that comes from following the path of such desirous mental activity. Regarding such thoughts as revolting, they give them up. They do not delight in such thinking. Instead, they develop{{note:{index:498,id:UT22084-068-021-6672}}} the understanding that such thinking prevents the attainment of the grounds. They also teach others about the character of sexual misconduct, establish them on the path, and inform them about the flaws of sense pleasures.

The splendors of those born in the center of a blue lotus or a mandārava are such that they assume a violet or blue color that resembles the flower they are born within. Similarly, they may also appear with multiple colors. In perfect accord with their respective lotus flowers, the gods’ bodies may be resplendent in the colors of the seven precious substances. How are they resplendent in the colors of the seven precious substances? They may have beryl-colored eyebrows and eyes, silvery nails, teeth of pearl with a reddish hue, bodies that are the color of pure gold from the Jambu River, or body hairs the color of sapphire, and they may have makeup{{note:{index:499,id:UT22084-068-021-6675}}} that resembles the saraka gem. In accordance with their karmic actions, they are born in the hearts of lotuses with such colorful bodies. Many of them have bodies the color of refined gold from the Jambu River, their hair is sapphire, their nails look like rubies, and their perfectly black body hairs resemble musāra. These are just some examples for those who have never seen anything of this sort. The bodies and garments of those born in mandārava flowers are also of many colorful kinds that match the flowers in which they are seated.

Hence, it is impossible to provide any example to illustrate even a single facet of their heavenly enjoyments. This is just to mention a tiny fraction of them—like a single drop of water compared to all the water in the ocean. That explanation is given so that one may understand the causal relationships that constantly arise from completed positive and virtuous actions. When people develop attachment to the ensuing enjoyments, they will also engage in positive actions. They may also develop a mindset that pursues liberation. Considering the way beings in existence are overcome by suffering and destroyed by their craving for objects, they will begin to question whether there is any happiness in cyclic existence whatsoever. Hence, this is an explanation of the effects of positive karmic actions—not an approval of the pleasures of the gods, which is based on attachment to existence.

Yet, even though they hear this message, the careless gods will continue just as if they had not heard a thing. They will not develop any weariness, for their faculties vacillate by nature, and the faculties of those who experience delightful enjoyments are particularly fickle. In this manner, these gods are constantly driven by enjoyment. Therefore, no matter how much one might inform them about reality and the nature of things, and about what is beneficial, meaningful, and correct, they will not understand.

There are valleys with flatlands, and pleasant alpine regions with hundreds of mountains that are at all times delightful to behold. Everywhere is lush with divine flowers, fruits, and vines. There are also hundreds of thousands of gorgeous caves, slopes, and valleys. This vista makes the gods abandon their round lotus petals. In groups of hundreds of thousands, they will depart, draped in flower garlands that never wither and which possess divine colors, fragrances, and textures.

Yet, out of love for these gods who are lost in careless abandon, Musulundha, ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife, will now produce emanations that encourage them to give up such carelessness and that pacify their passion for appearance and youth. By the great lake known as Expansive looms a mountain known as Blue Shade, made of radiant beryl with ores of gold and silver. This mountain features bright and colorful forests that shimmer with light and are flush with hundreds of thousands of cascades with refreshing waters. The dazzling mountain summits are adorned with groves and pools. Numerous species of spectacular flowers grow in profusion on this mountain, and there are thousands of exquisite mansions draped with vines. Within this gorgeous setting on that lofty mountain, the ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife now produces an inconceivable miraculous display of divine substances. This he does for the benefit of the gods who live in that delightful realm and for the benefit of other gods as well. He projects divine bodies with exuberant youthfulness, luster, and swiftness who dance, sing, laugh, pose, and frolic in ways that are ten times superior to those of the gods in that delightful realm. All the features of their divine objects cannot compare to even a tenth of the special features of Musulundha’s emanations. {{page:{number:1641,id:UT22084-068-021-101669,folio:F.279.a,volume:V70}}} These emanations are devoid of the slightest unattractive features related to their bodies, youth, dimensions, colors, shapes, postures, song, dance, or play—such is the great display of emanations that is manifested upon Mount Blue Shade, while the mountain’s general environment remains the same beryl nature as before.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.3968,id:UT22084-068-021-6782}}}“The gods and goddesses that emanate from the beautiful summits of that lofty mountain sing to music from the five types of instruments in ways that are captivating and enchanting. These emanations gradually enter all the parks where the actual gods dance and strut in celebration. Even when the gods hear the songs of the emanations, which are ten times more melodious than their own, they and their goddesses will still remain absorbed in their joyful games, just as before. But as the emanated gods leisurely arrive, the gods of the realm will notice the difference between themselves and the emanations, and thus they will realize that they are in all regards unattractive when compared to the emanations. In this way, any conceits about having a superior form will be overcome. The emanations surpass the gods in terms of their attire. Their light surpasses the light that radiates from the gods’ bodies. Their melodious songs surpass the beauty of the gods’ songs. Even their fragrances surpass the gods’ fragrances. In all matters pertaining to their size, luster, and figure, the emanations surpass the original gods and goddesses. {{page:{number:1642,id:UT22084-068-021-101670,folio:F.279.b,volume:V70}}} This is also the case with respect to their pleasures of the five types of objects, which also surpass the gods’ pleasures of the five types of objects.

The splendor of the original gods is outshone by the emanations just as all the splendor of the planets, heavenly constellations, and stars is outshone when the sun rises in Jambudvīpa. The splendor of their music is outshone just as human music is outshone by that of the gods. In that same way, their songs are also outshone. Their size, luster, and figures are outshone in the same way that the gods of the Heaven Free from Strife surpass humans.

They will enter among the petals of the great lotuses, dancing, flirting, strutting, and befriending one another in the single pursuit of passion. At that point, those beings, who are vastly superior to the gods of the Heaven Free from Strife, {{page:{number:1643,id:UT22084-068-021-101671,folio:F.280.a,volume:V70}}} will sing the following verses out of concern for the gods:

Thus, wishing to benefit the original gods of that realm, Musulundha shows them this display of his emanated gods, thereby causing them to grow disheartened.

When the original gods hear the ravishing songs of the emanated gods, they will be struck with amazement, and thus they will stop their own singing, dancing, playing, reveling, and celebrating. Instead, they will now watch the emanations with one-pointed attention. The emanations, for their part, will keep dancing, singing, flirting, strutting, and enjoying themselves in sundry inimitable ways, entering among the lotus petals as they sing and dance.

Some of the emanations will sink into the lake, some will bob up only to disappear again, some will flail on the surface of the water, and some will clutch onto each other as they sink, crying out to one another, ‘Help! Save us!’ Thus they will scream as they try to grab one another for support.

In this way, all the emanated gods on that petal will now also plunge in horror. Some will sink into the water while others scream out furiously in despair due to this sudden change. Some will disappear and cannot be seen. Some will thrash about in the water and then drown. Some will bellow out in rage. The goddesses likewise will suffer devastation and become outraged. All the gods are distraught as they sink. Floundering and clutching onto each other, they will disappear into the water, just like drowning men lost at sea after a shipwreck.

As they encounter these many horrific sights, they will feel profoundly distressed and terrified, and they will be struck by the deepest gloom. When the emanated gods fall into the lake, those around them will stand by in agony, crying, ‘What is this? Something like this has never happened before! Never have gods experienced anything like this—now even the gods must face such unbearable pain!’ They will cry out in such ways as they witness the utter horror of this terribly alarming turn of events. With all this on their minds, they will confer with each other and be overcome by a tremendous sadness.

As the original gods become anxious, their minds will become pliable, for as their carelessness decreases, they become capable of accomplishing the qualities of the transcendence of suffering. Seeing this, Musulundha, who is wholly intent on benefiting others, will make the lotus flowers and the gods disappear. Thereby, a vast congregation of beings lost in carelessness will now obtain a virtuous state of mind. These beings will now be capable of apprehending the teaching of the sacred Dharma and can now be taught the sacred Dharma.

He will let a hundred petals fall, causing his emanated gods to undergo numerous horrors and disasters as they sink in the lake, crying in many different ways, mad and wounded, dying in the lake in great numbers. Having watched this for a long time, the determination of the original gods will be broken. Distraught, they will try to go elsewhere, but wherever they go they will see more of the same disheartening appearances. They will become extremely distressed and dejected at what they see. Finally, they will retreat into a lotus bulb where they will find other careless gods to play with. {{page:{number:1649,id:UT22084-068-021-101677,folio:F.283.a,volume:V70}}} However, when Musulundha notices what is happening, he will act with altruistic care and concern. With supreme compassion, he acts for the benefit of others, and thus he will make his emanations follow the gods into the lotus flower. At this point, he will finally let all his emanations disappear and bring the gods relief. He will then tell them, ‘You gods who circulate through these realms of profound terror, as you wander through such realms of profound terror, do not wander carelessly! This is the situation awaiting those who roam carelessly! Those who roam carelessly will face profound terror. No one who is careless can possibly avoid suffering.’ Then Musulundha will utter these verses:

Among those who resemble friends in form only but who are not friends, carelessness is by far the worst because it is thoroughly mixed with lustful desire. Among those chains, bonds, or ropes that bind us, carelessness is by far the worst, for it is thoroughly mixed with fierce aggression. No wasteland devoid of water, trees, fruits, shade, or mounts can be as aggravating as the wasteland of carelessness, for lacking the waters of joy and the shady trees of noble beings’ discipline, it ultimately brings suffering upon all beings. Nothing is as deceptive or as meaningless as carelessness. Carelessness far surpasses the examples of the rim of the water wheel, the city of the gandharvas, or an optical illusion, for the fluctuating enjoyment of objects is far more meaningless and futile than a spinning water wheel, a city of the gandharvas, or an optical illusion. No precipice or abyss is as treacherous as carelessness, for it is certain to bring the experience of the inauspicious fall into the lower realms. {{page:{number:1654,id:UT22084-068-021-101682,folio:F.285.b,volume:V70}}} Carelessness causes gods and all living beings—all that are born in the five classes of beings and within the three realms—to suffer that inauspicious fall.

{{milestone:{label:4.C.4059,id:UT22084-068-021-6875}}}“As for the relishing of pleasures, this is just as explained. {{page:{number:1664,id:UT22084-068-021-101692,folio:F.290.b,volume:V70}}} It refers to a rich variety of dance, laughter, flirtation, and song, as well as a wealth of garments, food, and drink, and refers also to the service and passionate embrace of women. The relishing of pleasure implies an attachment-fueled consumption of exquisite sense pleasures. What are the flaws connected with such relishing? The attainment of pleasure is preceded by craving, and from such an attached pursuit of pleasure follows decay. In this way, generally speaking, the many sufferings associated with destruction will follow. What one has obtained will be taken by others, or one’s possessions may be ruined by the five types of destruction, such as a ruler, flooding, bandits, or fire. Pleasures also become the basis for other types of suffering, for they make one prone to constant worries about any harm or destruction that may be inflicted by enemies. In this way, one becomes subject to an incessant inundation of fear. Preceded by attachment, pleasures create constant mental torment. Such are the physical and mental flaws that ensue from craving pleasure. For as long as they live, childish beings with base minds thus keep suffering from the many forms of distress and torment that ensue as the flaws of attachment to pleasure.

All of that is caused by attachment to pleasure. For the sake of pleasure, kings fight and quarrel with one another. They may then enter into war, and countries will be destroyed. They take the many sufferings of killing and imprisonment to an extreme. Since all of that happens for the sake of pleasures, these flaws of pleasures should be clearly discerned. Because they cause bondage for everyone in cyclic existence, pleasures in particular should be comprehended.

Likewise, for the sake of pleasures, common people will also set out to sea, fight one another, and put up with pointless bondage, suffering, exhaustion, worry, struggle, and destruction.

Starving spirits strike each other with swords in pursuit of food or intercourse—this is done for the sake of pleasure.

In order to further increase the understanding and joy of the gods, Musulundha will emanate from his body kings who are adorned with crowns and endowed with all manner of perfect pleasures. Just as before, the kings are attended by supreme consorts who are in the prime of youth. Everyone is strikingly beautiful and possesses all manner of perfections. Yet as time passes, {{page:{number:1672,id:UT22084-068-021-101700,folio:F.294.b,volume:V70}}} the bodies of the kings begin to stoop and their hair turns gray. Their bodies become decrepit, their faces wrinkled, and their hair white. They now have to support themselves with staffs, and their emaciated bodies lose their former strength. They can now only move assisted by others, and they become everyone’s laughingstock, drawing their breath with loud wheezing noises and struggling to keep themselves upright. The power of their faculties fades, and they no longer find joy in anything. They become repulsive to everyone. Staggering, they will approach the lake and, as their strength has diminished tremendously, they will now have to be supported by other people in order to shuffle their feet and walk.

Stricken by the most undesirable conditions, the kings will finally pass away in extreme agony.

As they stand there crying, some birds will fly in and take off with the bodies of the kings as if they were twigs, stones, or sticks. At this, the asura women, who are overcome by sorrow, will become so overwhelmed by distress that they also die.

Amid their consorts, these wrathful beings are all seized by the wheel of time. Other nāgas will begin to fight and struggle and end up killing each other.

Yet they also become afflicted by aging and disease, and they too are dragged away by the noose of the Lord of Death.

Such beings in the intermediate state, on the way to any one of the five realms, will now appear to the original gods. Based on their diverse karmic backgrounds and impelled by their final states of mind, they are about to be reborn. Musulundha will emanate hundreds of thousands of such beings in the intermediate state, on their way to taking rebirth within the five realms of beings, so that the original gods may develop strong disenchantment. At that very lake, the original gods will now come to see a vast array of inconceivable and amazing sights. Steered by their karmic actions and afflictions, beings roam the five realms, migrating from one world to another, wandering among hell beings, starving spirits, animals, gods, and humans. Unprotected and helpless, they exchange one life for another, turning into hell beings, starving spirits, animals, gods, and humans, as they pass from one life to another. Such is the astonishing and most terrifying condition of the beings in the intermediate state, and the original gods will witness these horrifying and deeply distressing states of affairs in terror. {{page:{number:1677,id:UT22084-068-021-101705,folio:F.297.a,volume:V70}}}

Having been utterly deceived, they will at that point fall headfirst. When they die and transmigrate, the aggregates that were previously appropriated in a divine stream of being will at that point fade away. Instead, the aggregates of a being in the intermediate state will emerge, like an imprint made by a seal. Those who have engaged in actions associated with the hells will then, as such karmic actions of cyclic existence ripen, encounter great terror and excruciating pain.

Since their minds are extremely feeble, they would succumb in that very instant. Still, the gods will now perceive unimaginable sufferings, and that is the reason the ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife manifests his emanations.

Those who, while drifting in cyclic existence throughout billions of eons, avoid falling under the power of carelessness will through such endeavors take birth in the joyful higher realms.

The summary of the sufferings they face in the higher realms is as follows: (1) the suffering of the intermediate state, (2) the suffering of being in the womb, (3) the suffering of emerging from the womb, (4) the suffering of feeding, (5) the suffering of wanting, (6) the suffering of encountering the disagreeable, (7) the suffering of being separated from loved ones, (8) the suffering of being oppressed by cold, heat, and so forth, (9) the suffering of disease, (10) the suffering of being controlled by others, (11) the suffering of striving, (12) the suffering of being in unwholesome company, (13) the suffering of taking care of children and family, (14) the suffering of hunger and thirst, (15) the suffering of losing influence and aging,{{note:{index:514,id:UT22084-068-021-6930}}} and (16) the most intense and painful suffering of all, the suffering of death. Those sixteen forms of intense suffering pertain to the human world. They are experienced by beings born as humans, and they culminate in death. For other beings there are many other kinds of suffering, which are utterly unbearable. {{page:{number:1682,id:UT22084-068-021-101710,folio:F.299.b,volume:V70}}} There is no pleasure to be found in this or any other realm, which is not subject to eventual exhaustion and destruction.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4106,id:UT22084-068-021-6931}}}“ ‘First of all, what type of suffering is felt by the spirits born into the intermediate state between two lives? Such beings, who are blown about by the winds of karmic action, cannot be seen with the physical eye, but only with the divine eye. These spirits are unrestricted, so when they are about to take birth as humans, their appearance will accord with their future appearance and family, which in turn are effects of their generosity, discipline, and insight that may be of inferior, intermediate, or superior quality. As for the food of such spirits, if they are going to be born into a house of poor people, their food will be crude and of inferior color, smell, texture, and portions. Due to their insufficient power of generosity, they will then also fail to find sustenance in their coming life. This is the first among the sufferings of humans.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4107,id:UT22084-068-021-6932}}} “ ‘Next, having become a human, one will remain in the womb due to the influence of karmic actions and afflictions. If one is to be born in a poor home, one will, through the umbilical cord from the placenta, receive bad food, rough and sour food, and food in insufficient amounts. Hence, the developing fetus will have an unhealthy complexion and become emaciated. The movements of the mother will be extremely uncomfortable to the fetus, causing it to slosh about within the confines of the abdomen. Cold and hot food will also be painful. In this way, the fetus encounters intense and inescapable suffering, and even though it is traumatized, it lacks any strength to respond. {{page:{number:1683,id:UT22084-068-021-101711,folio:F.300.a,volume:V70}}} Sinking in a quagmire of urine and feces, it experiences immense suffering. That is the second kind of suffering, and since such suffering can be found even in the higher realms, there is no need to speak of what hell beings, starving spirits, and animals endure.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4108,id:UT22084-068-021-6933}}} “ ‘There is also a third kind of suffering, because if one subsequently emerges from the womb, the confines of the birth canal feel overwhelmingly cramped.

{{milestone:{label:4.C.4109,id:UT22084-068-021-6934}}} “ ‘Next follows a fourth kind of suffering. Although one’s body is extremely tender and delicate—like freshly churned butter or the leaves of the plantain—one will at birth be handled by crude, hurried, and boorish midwives. Their complexion is poor, and they lack competence. Skinny and with gaping eyes, they are crude, make jokes, and chatter distastefully. Being taken up by their hands feels excruciating, like being burned by flames or cut by a knife, because one’s body is so extremely soft and sensitive. Even if the newborn is swaddled in the softest of fabrics, it feels like it is being compressed in a horrid, coarse, rough, crude, foul, oppressive, and stifling hovel. In the cold season, the cold will feel penetrating and one’s birth home will be icy. Likewise, in the hot season the heat will be overwhelming, and thus one will be tormented by scorching heat. The reason for this burning pain is a deficiency with respect to generosity. {{page:{number:1684,id:UT22084-068-021-101712,folio:F.300.b,volume:V70}}} In this way, one is born from the mother’s womb under searing pain.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4110,id:UT22084-068-021-6935}}} “ ‘Next follows the suffering of feeding due to insufficient generosity, for as one is breastfed one also experiences suffering. If one’s mother fails to eat sufficient food, the milk in her breasts will also be scarce. The baby’s body will then become emaciated, lose its luster, take on an unhealthy complexion, and wither away until only sinew, bone, and skin remain. With the body of the baby thus becoming emaciated, it is prone to disease. Subsistence will become unbearable for the baby. Even if at some point the baby should obtain some food or drink, the baby will be so overcome by thoughts of consuming it that the smell, taste, and texture of the food will seem insufficient and inadequate, and the food may even be consumed by others. In this way, the baby may either die or only barely subsist, suffering from starvation. If at that time, however, the baby should be able to drink from its mother’s breasts, it may survive due to its adoration of her beautiful body. However, because of such inferior generosity, all the mother’s milk will eventually run dry. If at that point the baby eats a well-cooked meal, its stomach may at first feel full, but the food will later cause tremendous pain.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4111,id:UT22084-068-021-6936}}} “ ‘After that comes a fifth suffering, which is caused by hankering. Those tormented by the suffering of having to feed will want to explore in all directions because their stomachs are oppressed by starvation. Tormented by such pain, they may resort to stealing or engage in many other acts that are not beneficial. {{page:{number:1685,id:UT22084-068-021-101713,folio:F.301.a,volume:V70}}} For that reason, they may be killed by their cohabitants, thus coming to suffer the pain of dying, or they may find themselves on the verge of death.

Due to seeing that appearance, the mind will not feel appreciation or delight. {{page:{number:1686,id:UT22084-068-021-101714,folio:F.301.b,volume:V70}}} Instead, the mind and mental states become troubled and one becomes fearful.

When someone who is not a mendicant but pretends to be so—someone who is rotten on the inside, lacks learning, and whose behavior is like the sound of a conch—enters among the members of the saṅgha or visits a home he may, while bearing the attire of a monk, mentally indulge in the good taste experienced by his tongue. Based on such causes and conditions, he will, upon the disintegration of his body, suffer an inauspicious fall and be reborn in hell. Likewise, a lazy monk may give up his practice of concentration and instead, obsessed with food, {{page:{number:1688,id:UT22084-068-021-101716,folio:F.302.b,volume:V70}}} begin to wander from place to place in pursuit of it. When the body of such a lazy person disintegrates, he will suffer an inauspicious fall and be reborn in hell. O gods, such is the suffering of encountering the disagreeable as experienced by humans in the human realm and in relation to the tongue and taste.

It is the suffering that arises when people become so caught up in the experience of texture that they fail to consider what is virtuous, do not engage with the path of Dharma, and lose their mental equipoise. Such a situation is referred to as a base person becoming obsessed with a base object, and when the bodies of such people disintegrate, they will suffer an inauspicious fall and be reborn in hell. O gods, such is the suffering of humans in the human realm as they encounter the disagreeable.

Another type of suffering from encountering the disagreeable arises due to keeping company with unwholesome people. Suffering from encountering the disagreeable will definitely also occur when one hides a conflict inside and is subsequently overwhelmed by it at another time. These are three types of suffering that result from encountering the disagreeable. O gods, those are different forms of intense suffering that are encountered in the world of humans.’

Suffering due to separation from loved ones also refers to being separated from one’s parents, siblings, children, relatives, friends, or other loved ones. At that point, one’s mind is tortured more severely than if one were burned, abused, harmed by weapons, or had fallen into a fire. Such is the suffering of being separated from loved ones.’

Thus, he addresses the gods: ‘Gods, what sufferings are endured by humans in the human realm? They include the sufferings of cold and heat. Gods, if humans are exposed to cold, they freeze and suffer, but if they are exposed to heat, they suffer just as intensely. {{page:{number:1690,id:UT22084-068-021-101718,folio:F.303.b,volume:V70}}} Likewise, those who ingest too much food will also suffer. Taking too much rest also brings suffering, but so does standing or moving about for too long a time as well. Drinking too much is also painful. Dreams can be painful, and when, at night, one lies sleeping on the same side, that becomes painful, but if one shifts to the other side and keeps lying in that way, that position will also become very uncomfortable. The superficial pleasures arising from sexual union deceive humans in the human realm, and thus they fail to engage in positive actions. Completely overcome by such pleasures, they rush off into the hells. Gods, such intense forms of suffering in the human realm are sufferings that give a false appearance of pleasure. Gods, make sure not to end up like that!’
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4127,id:UT22084-068-021-6954}}} “In this way, Musulundha teaches the gods the Dharma for their benefit, warning them that their pleasures are just like those of humans. He teaches them the Dharma so that they may become disenchanted by their pleasures and turn away from cyclic existence. The ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife teaches so the gods may benefit from turning away from cyclic existence, and thus he guides those lost in carelessness.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4128,id:UT22084-068-021-6955}}} “The ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife next proceeds to teach the gods about another type of suffering that humans experience, explaining to them how humans in the human realm suffer from disease. Numerous different illnesses afflict humans. They suffer from contagions, dysentery, respiratory diseases, coughs—the full range of the four hundred and four diseases. Those overcome by the suffering of sexual relations are also eventually overcome by disease. {{page:{number:1691,id:UT22084-068-021-101719,folio:F.304.a,volume:V70}}} In this way, the humans in the human realm are ravaged by physical diseases. Likewise, agony and mental unhappiness are also human diseases, for that is what people of the world call them.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4129,id:UT22084-068-021-6956}}} “Musulundha then continues to teach the Dharma for the benefit of the gods. Describing cyclic existence and pointing out the blazing sufferings of the human world, he will go on to say, ‘Being under the power of others is also a source of suffering in the world of humans. O gods, certain humans are born into a shared social position: some belong to the same class, some are equally gifted, some are equally youthful, and some are equally powerful. Those who are in some regard inferior to them are then entirely under the power of their superiors. Throughout day and night, such inferior persons have no freedom and are constantly made to suffer. Such is the suffering of being under the power of others. The suffering of being under the power of others is hard to bear, because those whose family, appearance, diligence, charisma, intelligence, knowledge, or cognitive power are not of the highest class become subdued by their superiors and gradually end up in various positions of subservience.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4130,id:UT22084-068-021-6957}}} “ ‘Compared to Musulundha, the karmic actions of the gods are inferior—they lack generosity, and they are under his rule in the Heaven Free from Strife. Nevertheless, they enjoy freedom throughout day and night. However, it is a different story for those whose power of generosity is not as strong. They become impoverished and the skin on their hands and feet cracks and wears out. Wearing smelly clothes, they are constantly oppressed by hunger and thirst and must endure the sufferings of heat and cold. {{page:{number:1692,id:UT22084-068-021-101720,folio:F.304.b,volume:V70}}} In this way, the sufferings from being under the power of others are many and difficult to bear, making both day and night devoid of happiness. Whoever is inferior with respect to family, appearance, youth, charisma, and influence must attend on those with superior family, appearance, knowledge, and cognitive powers. They are outshone in all regards. Living in poverty and defeat, they must endure tremendous suffering. That is another intense form of suffering for gods and humans.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4131,id:UT22084-068-021-6958}}} “ ‘Another consequence of the suffering of being under the control of others arises when impoverished people who practice the Dharma come to depend on people who engage in unwholesome actions. If one serves and accompanies such people, one too will become unwholesome. Accordingly, when their masters engage in unattractive, ugly, and unpleasant activities, they too end up engaging in the exact same types of activities. Therefore, upon the disintegration of their bodies, they will suffer an inauspicious fall and be reborn in hell. Hence, the suffering of being under the power of others leads to deception with respect to both this world and the next and produces unwholesomeness.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4132,id:UT22084-068-021-6959}}} “ ‘O gods, there is also another form of great suffering that is extremely difficult to bear for the humans of the human world: the suffering of striving. Such suffering, which arises due to the pursuit of material things, may take many forms. For the sake of obtaining wealth, people may set out to sea, enter a precipice, or wage war. For various purposes and reasons, people burn themselves out as they become involved with others, serve lowly people, engage in agricultural work, pursue business, take up cow herding, travel abroad, come under the control of others, {{page:{number:1693,id:UT22084-068-021-101721,folio:F.305.a,volume:V70}}} scale high mountains, bustle around in the service of others, and so forth. All such struggles are basically made for the sake of obtaining wealth, food, and clothing. They are undertaken by people who suffer acutely from poverty and destitution and who are overcome by craving. From birth up until they are caught by the noose of craving thrown by the Lord of Death, they continue indulging in misdeeds. Striving to fulfil the wishes of others,{{note:{index:516,id:UT22084-068-021-6960}}} causing harm, making false measurements, being deceptive in family matters, peddling alcohol, selling sesame seeds, acquiring wealth by inappropriate means, destroying the environment, destroying the government, and conquering the land—in these and many other unwholesome ways, humans in the human realm act for the sake of their children, clothing, food, and drink. Such is the suffering of striving. Even if one went on for a thousand years, it would be hard to address the hundreds of thousands of forms that this suffering assumes. Gods, this is the epitome of human suffering.’
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4133,id:UT22084-068-021-6961}}} “In this way, the ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife teaches the gods the Dharma for their benefit and so they may feel weary of existence. Like humans, the gods also feel desire. Wishing to benefit beings who crave for existence, Musulundha therefore offers them instruction. Showing them the ways humans eke out a living, he admonishes the gods not to be born into such an existence. Humans are oppressed by such unwholesome endeavors, {{page:{number:1694,id:UT22084-068-021-101722,folio:F.305.b,volume:V70}}} and thus they are never genuinely happy. Such causal factors will later cause them to take rebirth among hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. Once reborn in those ways, they will experience numerous other kinds of pain.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4134,id:UT22084-068-021-6962}}} “Next, the ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife will teach the gods about another type of suffering: ‘O gods, humans in the human realm also experience another type of suffering, which is the suffering of associating with unwholesome companions. This refers to associating with evil people, or those who engage in all manner of pointless activities, and it causes all possible forms of suffering. People who keep unwholesome company will not only fail to achieve what is good for themselves, they will also engage in all kinds of unwholesome activities. All their conduct of body, speech, and mind will become flawed. Hence, due to such causes and conditions, they will, upon the disintegration of their bodies, suffer an inauspicious fall and be reborn in the hells. Such factors lead to copious suffering throughout the three lower realms, and thus they will be reborn in the realms of starving sprits and animals too.’
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4135,id:UT22084-068-021-6963}}} “In this way, the gods will understand how the world of humans is greatly flawed. They will see that those are not flaws pertaining to the realms of starving spirits or animals. Musulundha explains this so that upon seeing those flaws, the gods may end their fondness for human life and instead turn toward the state of peace, the transcendence of suffering.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4136,id:UT22084-068-021-6964}}} “The ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife will then continue his Dharma teaching for the benefit of the gods: ‘How else do humans suffer? They also suffer on account of their children, family, and friends. O gods, in the world of humans, children, family, and so forth are a source of extreme suffering. {{page:{number:1695,id:UT22084-068-021-101723,folio:F.306.a,volume:V70}}} Humans in the human realm feel a sharp pang if their family members or children are killed, enslaved, or the like, or if they suffer from hunger, thirst, or poverty. The reason they feel that intense pain is that they are so fond of such people. Because of this fondness, they suffer when their children are exposed to danger by others. Within the higher realms, such suffering is unique to humans. Such suffering, which is caused by having children and relatives, will often engender a state of mind that leads to further rebirths among humans. This is so because all forms of perception culminate in karmic action and, moreover, the ways all such people die will not be propitious. Birth, aging, and death constitute intense forms of suffering in cyclic existence, and they can all be observed in the world of humans. Therefore, understanding the nature of such unbearable sufferings, the gods must avoid developing a human mindset.’ In this way, Musulundha shows the gods in great detail the highest purpose, which is the path of auspiciousness.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4137,id:UT22084-068-021-6965}}} “Without anyone planning it, a rich network of objects manifests in the world of humans. What all does it comprise? The human world is said to be the foundation for the three lower realms, and thus it portends the innumerably many billions of indescribable sufferings found there. When the gods in the higher realms die and transmigrate, some among them who were not so careless will be told, ‘Gods, within the higher realms of karmic action, you should now proceed to the human world!’ {{page:{number:1696,id:UT22084-068-021-101724,folio:F.306.b,volume:V70}}} Then, when such humans subsequently pass away, their friends and companions may offer benedictions and advise them, ‘Please proceed to the joyous realms of the gods!’ In that way, both their origin and destination will be in the higher realms. There are two joyous realms, whereas the remaining three realms are all painful.

Since he is always careful, he teaches through many different means and methods a Dharma that is bountiful, ultimate, and sublime. Once he has demonstrated the sufferings associated with having sons and daughters, he then proceeds to explain to the gods, ‘There is also another type of suffering in the human realm. What is that? The intense suffering that is experienced due to hunger and thirst. All the many adverse conditions experienced by humans are rooted in the torments of hunger and thirst. The thus-gone ones do not mention any suffering as diverse as this. Fearing the sufferings of hunger and thirst, humans indulge in a wide variety of pitiful activities. When destitute, even those who were born into important families will end up begging from their inferiors with joined palms, tears streaming down their cheeks, and wailing in despair. Likewise, people who tell lies do so because they are all tormented by the fear of poverty and the resulting hunger and thirst. {{page:{number:1697,id:UT22084-068-021-101725,folio:F.307.a,volume:V70}}} Moreover, without giving any thought to their own survival, people may throw themselves into the battlefield amid raised weapons and terrifying elephant tusks, all because of the torments of hunger and thirst. People may also risk their lives sailing across hundreds of thousands of leagues of stormy seas infested with crocodiles and sea monsters,{{note:{index:517,id:UT22084-068-021-6967}}} or engage in other such hazardous sea ventures, all due to the suffering of hunger and thirst. In these and many other ways human beings are subject to indescribable suffering. Hardly any human suffering compares to that of being dragged to the executioner’s stake to the beating of the paṭaha drum and with a garland of oleander flowers tied around your neck. Your fear and horror are incredibly intense as you near the end of your life, and yet the terror you thus experience is still not comparable to that of hunger and thirst.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4139,id:UT22084-068-021-6968}}} “ ‘Therefore, to eliminate that suffering, one must practice acts of generosity that are perfect in terms of one’s intention, the recipients, and the things that are given. The time must be right, one must give what is needed, and the giving must be continuous. Fear and suffering in cyclic existence is, indeed, felt by the gods as well, but their suffering associated with food is very minor by comparison. {{page:{number:1698,id:UT22084-068-021-101726,folio:F.307.b,volume:V70}}} Therefore, be generous so that you may be free from hunger and thirst. O gods, for humans in the world of humans, there is copious suffering due to hunger and thirst. Humans have access to very few of the pleasures of soft and heavenly substances, and thus they suffer. Gods do not comprehend this because, for them, food and drink of heavenly substance are abundant and readily available. But all around you in this desire realm, the terrors and sufferings of hunger and thirst burn like fire fanned by the wind. Therefore, gods, make sure that you do not rush off to take birth in the realms of humans! You must be sure to take this to heart once again: the world of humans is mostly marked by birth, aging, and disease.’

This is the way he diligently engages in what is beneficial for others. Generally speaking, benefiting oneself comes easily, whereas helping others is difficult. Still, doing what is beneficial for others is also mutually beneficial, and therefore Musulundha will continue to teach the gods the Dharma in many different ways. He teaches the gods, who have now found other interests in ways that are free from impairment, and who have become fearful of pleasures, about the sufferings of humanity: ‘Ah, gods, there is another type of intense suffering for humans. It is the suffering of losing influence, which occurs when people suffer from a bad reputation, thus rendering them mentally tormented, bereft of mental power, and weak. {{page:{number:1699,id:UT22084-068-021-101727,folio:F.308.a,volume:V70}}}

Poor people, in particular, suffer the pain of a lowly reputation when they are in the presence of friends, family, companions, or relatives who all enjoy favorable circumstances. Due to their own lack of influence, they end up as servants for these people. A second flaw of having a lowly reputation is that such impoverished people become obsessed with eating in the homes of others. A third flaw is that they enjoy talking to strangers. A fourth flaw of such deluded people is that they tell blatant lies to their friends and twist the truth. They are overwrought by the stains of unwholesome dwellings and food, and thus they take delight in being with women adorned with anklets. In this way, they sow the seeds for future problems. O gods, in the human world, there are many such sufferings related to ill repute that smolder in people’s hearts. For humans in the human world, the fire of gossip becomes ten times worse when the gossip takes place among family, friends, and loved ones. This fire consumes people’s bodies and limbs completely.

When it comes to gossip, humans are masters—none of the beings in the four other realms can compare. Humans in the human world are the most highly skilled in that regard and, for those who are arrogant and conceited, gossip is as painful as an unbearable disease. Gossip is intensely painful as it reduces people from a level of equality to a state where they retain only one tenth of their former influence. Such is the suffering of incurring a bad reputation. If it occurs just once, arrogant people may only feel its effects in passing. But as it lingers in their minds{{note:{index:518,id:UT22084-068-021-6972}}} and increases over time, it will resurface just as before.

It destroys the faculty of the life force as well as the sense sources. It permanently puts an end to meeting one’s family, companions, and friends, and it destroys all good fortune. As people depart for the next life, they must traverse a path consisting of the effects of their former actions. At the end of their life, all beings must go through the experience of relinquishing their body.

Wondering what karmic actions cause beings to take birth in that realm, he notices how holy people may observe discipline with a virtuous state of mind and thus give up killing and stealing just as described before. As for sexual misconduct, they give up even the subtlest aspects. For example, should they come upon a depiction of a woman together with a man, they will not for even a moment pay any attention to it, since that would amount to an incorrect engagement of the mind. They will not covet it and they will not relish it. {{page:{number:1709,id:UT22084-068-021-101738,folio:F.2.a,volume:V71}}} Rather, they will be afraid of the arising of inappropriate mental engagements and afflictions that pollute the mind.

In that realm, they will play around accompanied by the blissful humming of bees. In those lush groves, the happiness of the gods continuously increases in relation to their thoughts and deeds. The many rocks made of diamond, sapphire, and crystal shine with a rich and lovely brilliance. The gods enjoy the enrapturing sound of the many cascading waterfalls and are free to enjoy to their hearts’ content the incomparable divine substances found there. Surrounded by retinues of hundreds of thousands of divine ladies, they enjoy the greatest forms of happiness and an ever-increasing amount of pleasures, while they partake of myriad varieties of divine substance that are beyond compare. Traveling through the sky, they set out on hundreds of journeys among mountainous summits of gold and beryl.

Listen and pay close attention to this religious teaching of the Dharma. All you careless gods and eloquent birds ruled by Auspicious Time, please listen.

The eleven great teachings constitute an elevenfold process of relinquishment. Through that process, one will genuinely transcend craving and suffering, one will no longer wish to remain within the realm of the māras, one will destroy all the ties of cyclic existence, one will remain in the peaceful wilderness, one will delight in solitude, one will place one’s hopes in what is correct, and one will develop the wish to crush ignorance. What does this elevenfold process relinquish and what are the eleven factors? (1) Agitation is remedied by taming oneself, (2) lack of restraint by one-pointedness, (3) flawed discipline by following a holy person, (4) laziness by diligence, (5) obsession with visiting villages and towns by remaining alone in the wilderness, (6) greed by contentment, (7) obsession with visiting friends and relatives {{page:{number:1738,id:UT22084-068-021-101767,folio:F.16.b,volume:V71}}} by joyfully staying in foreign lands for a long time, (8) meaningless talk by proper verbal restraint, (9) frivolity by steadfastness, (10) poverty by generosity, and (11) ignorance by means of knowledge.

Those who wish to go beyond the realm of the māras, who fear the terrors of cyclic existence, and who wish to destroy carelessness should give these up. The whole of cyclic existence is rooted in carelessness, while carefulness is the root of liberation. That is what the Blessed One has taught those who wish to escape from cyclic existence.
(1) Agitation Is Remedied by Taming Oneself
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4290,id:UT22084-068-021-7137}}}“ ‘Those who delight in taming themselves, those who wish to become tamed, and all beings who wish for what is desirable, attractive, and delightful should shun agitation. That unwholesome factor should be relinquished by all who delight in becoming tamed. In that regard, there are five types of agitation: (1) When on the way to a village or town, one may walk quickly, (2) one may walk without proper restraint, (3) one may let one’s clothing hang loose, (4) one may lift up one’s clothing, and (5) one may wander about or become distracted. When others see such behavior, they will immediately become upset.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4291,id:UT22084-068-021-7138}}} “ ‘Whence derives such unrestrained styles of walking? On the most subtle level, they originate in infatuation and lack of attention. From these spring numerous forms of agitation. {{page:{number:1739,id:UT22084-068-021-101768,folio:F.17.a,volume:V71}}} Those can be remedied by maintaining restrained conduct, by walking with one’s eyes focused at the distance of a yoke’s length ahead, by keeping one’s clothing fastened, by wearing a long upper shawl and not lifting one’s clothing higher than four finger widths above the knees, and by not letting one’s shoulders swagger. In this way, the carelessness of the divine world is conquered by carefulness.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4292,id:UT22084-068-021-7139}}} “ ‘Among the four types of carelessness that a monk or someone of a similar kind should overcome, what are the remaining ones? The first is to make remarks, even minor ones, without having examined matters properly and without proper judgement. Those who maintain restraint speak properly when in the homes of donors and benefactors. They do not snap their fingers and they take a low seat. The unrestrained, on the other hand, speak excessively and without any awareness of what should and should not be said. While seated, they speak with loud voices, and their attention is devoted to the women in the house. Rashly, they end up agitated or angry. They do not show any consistent concern for their company. Monks whose conduct is agitated and unrestrained in this way are disagreeable and unpleasant, and people will therefore wonder whether other monks are available whose conduct and demeanor are serene and proper. Men or other family members will thus comment, “Alas, those monks are unrestrained.”
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4293,id:UT22084-068-021-7140}}} “ ‘Alternatively, those who maintain proper restraint will always speak words that are relevant and appropriate. Whether they meet new people or people they are used to seeing, whether they meet benefactors, donors, or other such people, they always speak gently and with awareness of the time and place. {{page:{number:1740,id:UT22084-068-021-101769,folio:F.17.b,volume:V71}}} Their words are peaceful, meaningful, and do not contradict reality. They do not become preoccupied with females. They do not snap their fingers. They are aware of the time. They know when it is time to leave, or they can sense this indirectly. They do not lift up their Dharma robes and do not let their shoulders swagger while walking. They do not cough loudly. They do not chide others. They always respond respectfully to questions. Their words are calm, pleasant, and in accordance with the Dharma. In this way, agitation is overcome by taming oneself.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4294,id:UT22084-068-021-7141}}} “ ‘Such people also overcome another form of agitation by means of taming themselves. In what way? When entering a household, they do not engage in songs, dance, or music. They do not pay attention to laughter, flirtation, or coquetry, and they do not listen to the conversations or jokes of others. They do not relish any of that and they have no wish for it. They have no fondness for large gatherings. When visiting a household, they do not talk about the lifestyles of other homes. They do not come and go in a big hurry and they are not restless. Nor are they overly relaxed. This is the way that monks enter the homes of others. When they go to the home of a benefactor, donor, or the like, they crush, destroy, and dispel agitation by means of taming themselves.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4295,id:UT22084-068-021-7142}}} “ ‘Otherwise, if a monk engages in conversation with benefactors and donors when visiting a household, he may set aside words of the Dharma and instead speak about pleasures. He may end up speaking about various lands and places, {{page:{number:1741,id:UT22084-068-021-101770,folio:F.18.a,volume:V71}}} about the higher realms, or about dancers and dances, or music and song. In towns and elsewhere, he may speak in emotionally charged ways. He may interact with women and wear a fancy outfit when visiting people’s homes. Such agitation may occur for monks or others of a similar kind.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4296,id:UT22084-068-021-7143}}} “ ‘How can the flaws of such agitation be overcome by means of taming oneself? When visiting a household, monks or others of a similar kind will speak in a manner that is concerned with goodness. For example, they may speak of generosity or discipline, or they may praise wisdom. They may talk about the fall into the lower realms, or about aging, disease, or loss. They will speak about the way karmic actions are appropriated, or about destitution or death. They will utter words that inspire respect in others. Their words will be centered on what brings goodness. They will talk about suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. They will talk about the way the different stages are achieved. They praise discipline and explain how it first arises. They speak of freedom from desire and the way stinginess is overcome. To those who are crazed by infatuation with physical form they explain how form is infinite, how it is deceptive, and how the young are always tricked by aging. All they say is therefore spoken with a knowledge of the thoughts of their donors and benefactors. {{page:{number:1742,id:UT22084-068-021-101771,folio:F.18.b,volume:V71}}} This is how monks give up agitation by means of taming themselves.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4297,id:UT22084-068-021-7144}}} “ ‘There are also other types of agitation they give up by means of taming themselves. For example, some may only frequent places where there is plenty of food and drink. Moreover, out of desire and obsession with food, others will go where the food is most plentiful or wherever they have patronage and companionship so that they can profit from that. As long as they receive all this, they remain happy with their Dharma robes, alms, dwelling place, and medical remedies.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4298,id:UT22084-068-021-7145}}} “ ‘On the other hand, those who have already tamed themselves do not miss or relish such pleasures. They do not think of such things but travel alone, basing themselves on what is good and practicing restraint. This is how monks or others of a similar kind overcome agitation by means of taming themselves. All agitation comes from a profusion of carelessness. All that is meaningless is rooted in carelessness. Therefore, all who pursue the transcendence of suffering must focus on overcoming carelessness.’ This is how Musulundha teaches the Dharma, which he has himself heard from a god in the past, to the royal swan Auspicious Time and the careless forces of the māras.”
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4299,id:UT22084-068-021-7146}}}Within the blessed Kāśyapa’s discourse on the eleven topics, this completes the first of them.
(2) Lack of Restraint Is Remedied by One-Pointedness
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4300,id:UT22084-068-021-7148}}}“ ‘The second topic is as follows: Lack of restraint means not being one-pointed. Such lack of restraint is moreover twofold, because it pertains to both the mundane and the supramundane. {{page:{number:1743,id:UT22084-068-021-101772,folio:F.19.a,volume:V71}}} Possessing restraint is a matter of maintaining a one-pointed mind. There are many ways of observing restraint, but in short there are two kinds, because some relate to natural unwholesomeness and others to acquired unwholesomeness. Those who are flawed by natural unwholesomeness are neither monks nor followers of Kāśyapa. If one commits acts of killing, sexual misconduct, or stealing, one’s mind will entail a threefold deterioration.{{note:{index:526,id:UT22084-068-021-7149}}} One may have been a righteous person but will nonetheless get carried away and subsequently engage in sexual relations. Then, regardless of the object, one’s companion, or the instructions imparted, one will no longer be a monk or a follower of Kāśyapa. Such people are nothing more than rotten, evil, false charlatans. And when one’s discipline becomes flawed due to such natural unwholesomeness, that is due to carelessness. Therefore, diligent followers of Kāśyapa must give up carelessness.’
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4301,id:UT22084-068-021-7150}}} “This is how the ruler of the Heaven Free from Strife, Musulundha, teaches the discourse of Kāśyapa. Residing in the center of a lotus flower, he addresses the bodhisattva Auspicious Time, the speaking swans, and the careless forces of the māras, and teaches them the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4302,id:UT22084-068-021-7151}}} “ ‘As for acquired unwholesomeness, there are nine kinds. What are these nine types of corruption? Partial practice, the practice of restoration through confession, careless practice, half practice, general practice, light practice of confession and restoration, practice due to having been shown and explained the path, destructive practice, and the practice of all. Such carelessness will ruin the mind of any childish person, regardless of whether they are monks or others of a similar kind. Those are, in short, the nine types of unwholesomeness of those who fail to train in the Dharma-Vinaya. {{page:{number:1744,id:UT22084-068-021-101773,folio:F.19.b,volume:V71}}}

It is to disregard minor points of training and minor forms of restoration and thus transgress them out of carelessness, thinking, “Just as I have previously transgressed this point, I shall restore it again.” One may, for example, dig a hole or cut grass. That is what is known as partial practice, whether in the case of mendicants or others of a similar kind.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4304,id:UT22084-068-021-7154}}} “ ‘How do the careless practice restoration through confession? Here, a mendicant or someone of a similar kind may fail to observe one, two, or three of the bases of training by thinking, “Although I now fail to observe and maintain the training in this way, I shall later resume it.” When in this way they disregard the relevant points of training they become constantly involved in acquired unwholesomeness. Those who act in this way do not practice the Dharma with respect, they are not careful, and their minds are constantly distracted. That is what is known as the practice of restoration through confession.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4305,id:UT22084-068-021-7155}}} “ ‘How do careless people cause carelessness to proliferate? Fickle individuals who lack strength of character do not understand what must be confessed with respect to the bases of training. They do not understand what is essential and what is not with regard to confession and restoration. Such people will acquire a great deal of unwholesomeness in relation to the bases of training. They will observe such unwholesome conduct and maintain it for a very long time under great hardship. They will also fail to maintain that which involves little unwholesomeness. {{page:{number:1745,id:UT22084-068-021-101774,folio:F.20.a,volume:V71}}} They will not be respectfully inclined toward the Dharma. Whether in the case of monks or others of a similar kind, this is what is known as the conduct of the careless that causes carelessness to proliferate.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4306,id:UT22084-068-021-7156}}} “ ‘What is then meant by half practice? Whether the basis of training is minor or major, a monk may either transgress it, adhere to it, or strongly refrain from it. However, if he merely considers transgressing it, he will only fall short in the factors that pertain to that category. That is what it termed half practice because he only practices one half of the conduct but not the other. Such a process is called half practice.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4307,id:UT22084-068-021-7157}}} “ ‘When careless people roam carelessly under the sway of carelessness among objects of carelessness, a spiritual practitioner or the like may engage in what is known as general practice. If one observes the complete bases of training, or if one is a nun, novice, or lay practitioner, one will very quickly attain the transcendence of suffering. However, if one does not accord with such behavior, and turns away from it, such practice is known as general practice. What is that like? General practice of the bases of training with respect to acquired unwholesomeness occurs when the bases of training are maintained without degeneration, without breaches, without downfalls, without lack of steadfastness, without lack of purpose, and without being inattentive to any point—yet only sometimes. Whether one is a mendicant or someone of a similar kind, that is what is meant by general practice.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4308,id:UT22084-068-021-7158}}} ‘What is light practice through confession and restoration? Out of carelessness, or due to the influence of an unwholesome friend, {{page:{number:1746,id:UT22084-068-021-101775,folio:F.20.b,volume:V71}}} some people fail to maintain the bases of training. As soon as they become aware of their mistakes, they may then confess and declare their transgressions to the saṅgha out of regret, faith, or fear of the hells. They may offer their confession, saying, “I have failed regarding the bases of training and engaged in acts that are not becoming. I request that the saṅgha restore my commitments.” In this way, they may, with the help of the relevant remedy, declare and confess their mistakes and restore their training out of fear. Hence, a monk who does so is said to practice through confession and restoration.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4309,id:UT22084-068-021-7159}}} “ ‘What is meant by practice due to having been shown and explained the path? Monks or others of a similar kind may sometimes become careless and incur much unwholesomeness. When thus transgressing or failing to observe the bases of training that cut through the root of the tree of suffering, they may declare their mistakes to their masters and the members of the saṅgha during the ritual for mending and purification. At that time, the saṅgha members may then instruct them about the path and teach them about its challenges and the terrors of neglecting one’s duties. Having instructed them and made them understand, they will then declare, “You strayed from proper conduct!” Out of fear of the realms of hell, starving spirits, and animals, such people will then never again transgress the bases of training. Auspicious Time, this is what is called practice due to having been shown and explained the path.

This occurs when someone has faith in, speaks of, and practices the entire Dharma-Vinaya.

Because of his respect for the Dharma, he will be unable to adhere to such unwholesomeness and instead will resume the training. Auspicious Time, this is known as confession and the practice of all. When a monk, or someone of a similar kind, at a later time transgresses the bases of training due to minor unwholesomeness, then that is also due to the flaws of carelessness.’

Since even the natural unwholesomeness that is associated with flawed discipline can be remedied by following and keeping company with holy people—such that one is released from cyclic existence—there is no need to mention that this also is the case with acquired unwholesomeness. Therefore, with great diligence, one must follow holy beings.

What is the fourth unwholesome factor to be overcome and relinquished by means of the fourth remedy? It is laziness that must be remedied by diligence. All forms of laziness can be conquered by developing diligence. For example, just as light overcomes darkness, the development of diligence causes all forms of laziness to be relinquished. Laziness is an obstacle to all good qualities. {{page:{number:1749,id:UT22084-068-021-101778,folio:F.22.a,volume:V71}}} In whatever one undertakes, laziness increases obstacles and causes hindrances to all mundane and supramundane qualities.

They do not attend to teachers but become consumed by an indolent state of mind. They are reviled by everyone. They do not develop any wisdom and they lack learning. Such people are not learned, and they have no knowledge of place and time. They do not know how to distinguish between themselves and others.

They will attend to such masters, and the more wisdom they develop, the more diligent they become.

They are deceptive factors that bring all manner of ruin and undesirable ripening. They are factors of unwanted bondage that manifest in childish and ordinary beings. These objects that cause distraction and delusion are enemies. As these renunciants no longer relish the experience of such objects, they cultivate the path of liberation and free their minds from stains. As they increasingly free their minds from stains, they become even more diligent and mindful, and thus, with superb awareness, they are able to conquer their enemies. Endowed with a joyous diligence, they overcome desire, anger, and ignorance. They become free from them, victorious over them, and prevent any further such existence. They become victorious against their adversaries and thus become just like the stainless sky or pristine water. They become like the stainless moon free from clouds or like the radiant sun that shines in Jambudvīpa when the fog has lifted. They are like people who have recovered from a disease, like destitute people discovering great wealth, or like blind people lost in the jungle who succeed in finding their way out. {{page:{number:1753,id:UT22084-068-021-101782,folio:F.24.a,volume:V71}}} As they achieve the fortune of having the foremost type of discipline, they receive full ordination and abide by that.

One must give up fondness for visits to towns and cities {{page:{number:1754,id:UT22084-068-021-101783,folio:F.24.b,volume:V71}}} and always dwell alone in the wild. If a monk is only accustomed to enjoying life in the city, he will always encounter obstacles. How so? Giving up the duties of a monk—concentration and recitation—he will instead go to live in towns and cities. As attachment to such homes intensifies, he will constantly participate in gatherings, whether among women or men. If he is among women, he will become fettered in all regards. He will fail in all his objectives and instead become swayed by desire. Women are like fire, and those who stay close to fire will be burned. Those who stay near women will also experience mental disturbances. Therefore, monks should not go to towns or cities. Moreover, if a monk participates in gatherings and discussions among men, he will also fail in all his objectives. He will not be genuinely inspired by the qualities of an undefiled mind.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4334,id:UT22084-068-021-7187}}} “ ‘There is yet another great obstacle that a monk who enters towns and cities will encounter. What is that? The mind of a monk who goes from one household to another will become agitated. Realizing what goes on in the household and seeing the food and drink that is enjoyed there, even though he may have relinquished it all, he will sooner or later indulge again in such erroneous conduct. He will surely emerge from the forest to become a householder. He will lose his fondness for life in the forest {{page:{number:1755,id:UT22084-068-021-101784,folio:F.25.a,volume:V71}}} and so again become bound by the flaws of domestic entanglements. He will develop desire, anger, and ignorance, and those flaws will cause him to take birth among hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. Such is the suffering that grows from fondness for visits to towns and cities. Therefore, wishing to be a genuine monk, one must give up such inclinations.

Living in the wilderness is the most excellent support for attaining every ultimate quality. The faculties of a monk who is fond of dwelling alone in the jungle are serene, his mind is very tranquil, and his way of thinking is like refined gold. He is most peaceful, carefully guarded, and free from any stains of fear. He discovers a happiness that is perfectly pure and undefiled. The happiness he achieves is unique. The six classes of gods in the desire realm, because of their genuine goodness and their distinctive past karmic actions, enjoy a ripening of desirable, attractive, and delightful effects, which are of an unparalleled character. Yet, all the happiness of those gods who live in the desire realm does not equal a fraction, or compare in any way, to a single moment of undefiled happiness. When examined further, there is nothing that can serve as an example. Therefore, those who wish for ultimate happiness must give up{{note:{index:528,id:UT22084-068-021-7189}}} all fondness for visiting towns and cities and instead pursue the bliss of concentration and equipoise. Always delighting in solitude, {{page:{number:1756,id:UT22084-068-021-101785,folio:F.25.b,volume:V71}}} they must reside upon a seat of straw, or the like, in mountainous retreats, in a cave in the mountains, or in the jungle.

The happiness that those who do go out to socialize with companions, friends, and family may find in such get-togethers is destructible, unstable, impermanent, and ultimately lost. It is imperfect. That which involves affliction is definitely never free from being stained, flawed, harmful, uncertain, and destructive. Therefore, when people of base minds wholly give up the ultimate form of happiness for the sake of inauthentic and defiling forms of happiness, they in fact pursue suffering. They give up the light and go in search of darkness. Thus they will wander, bereft of intelligence and blind to the distinction between good qualities and flaws. Therefore, one must give up living a life of fondness for visits to towns and cities. One must develop genuine joy in living alone in the jungle. In that way, one will leave behind all the afflictions and attain utterly perfect happiness. One must overcome this fifth type of stain by means of unblemished qualities. If you wish for happiness and find no joy in the realm of the māras, but want to stay clear of it, you must conquer all polluting factors by means of unblemished qualities.’

In accordance with place and time, I shall also teach you the remaining six, so give rise to one-pointed attention. If someone who has attained the freedoms and endowments does not teach or listen to the Dharma, such a person will end up utterly unfree. Therefore, as long as you possess perfect freedoms and riches, and as long as your faculties remain intact, you should teach the Dharma. Indeed, the three realms of hell beings, starving spirits, and animals are extremely painful. How could one listen to the Dharma in hell? And likewise, how could there be any Dharma-Vinaya among the starving spirits and animals, for they kill one another and suffer from thirst and hunger. Only among gods and humans can the Dharma be heard, and, even then, only among those who are free from carelessness and do not roam carelessly. I have given up carelessness and you have devoted interest and a virtuous frame of mind, so I shall teach you the Dharma. Therefore, listen with great respect. The Dharma-Vinaya is extremely rare and so is the attainment of excellent freedoms and riches.

By what transformative power can one overcome that highly polluted factor of greed? {{page:{number:1758,id:UT22084-068-021-101787,folio:F.26.b,volume:V71}}} Contentment. Greed prevents both householders and monastics from leading a happy life, because it makes one unhappy throughout day and night, whether one is a householder or a monastic. Greed is not as great an obstacle for householders as it is for monastics, who have stepped forth from the household, because greedy monastics are actually householders, not monastics. Monastics are those who overcome infatuation, pride, confusion, delusion, and envy, and who are free from greed. And any monk who can be said to be greedy also tends to be reproachable with respect to all those other flaws as well. A monk with a greedy mind remains obsessed with wealth throughout day and night and will not become inspired by virtuous qualities. His mind, faculties, and actions will all be impure, and he will abandon his journey. Even though he maintains the position of a monk, he is approaching the hells. His dwelling, medical supplies, and amenities initially manifest as obstacles, and later he will burn in hell. Greedy and unvirtuous people with flawed discipline are not mendicants but imposters. They are like jackals dressing up in a lion hide, or like counterfeit goods. Their conduct is like the sound of a conch—completely empty, deceptive, and void. Some greedy people claim, ‘I am a monk, I am a follower of Kāśyapa. {{page:{number:1759,id:UT22084-068-021-101788,folio:F.27.a,volume:V71}}} I have set forth under Kāśyapa’s Dharma-Vinaya.’ How will such greedy people not be burned by fire? When small-minded people become sick from greed, are they not infected by poison? When they grow old with greed, are they not aging? When they cut the root of the tree of virtue with the ax of greed, are they not severing that root? When they succumb to the disease of greed, are they not succumbing to disease itself? When the enemy of greed surrounds them, enters their heart, and kills their life force, are they not being surrounded by mortal enemies, waiting to kill them?

What is the seventh factor that is shown to be stained and that is to be conquered by unblemished qualities? It is fondness for seeing friends and family and staying with them on extended visits.

Thus, if he does not see his relatives, friends, or family, he may think, “I wonder what is going on in their homes” or “I wonder what has happened to those who live there.” Thinking in such ways, he would be stricken by suffering. Although he entered the forest to become free from suffering, he now ends up returning to that very situation. Such miserable people with inferior intelligence and fickle minds will then give up concerns for their own suffering in terms of birth, old age, sickness, and death, and instead become pained by the suffering of others.

{{milestone:{label:4.C.4367,id:UT22084-068-021-7228}}}“ ‘There is also another factor of affliction that must be overcome by those who have set forth. What is that? Meaningless talk. Even if one is a householder, meaningless talk will make one as worthless as grass. That is because words are wealth; other riches are deeply inferior. People become successful by means of their speech. Those who lack meaningful speech are unsuccessful and will lose any wealth they may have. Such people are hollow, false, of no substance, and just like cattle. People who lack the wealth of speech are human in name only; otherwise they are just like animals. They are shunned by the learned. They are vulgar and utterly base.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4368,id:UT22084-068-021-7229}}}“ ‘Hence, this factor that carries such consequences must be remedied by means of another factor. The factor of meaningless talk must be defeated completely. By means of what other factor? Speech that is properly restrained. Such restrained speech is, moreover, of two kinds, for one may either refrain from talking altogether or otherwise observe the four vows flawlessly. What are these four vows? They consist in giving up and refraining from lying, divisive talk, harsh words, and irrelevant words. {{page:{number:1768,id:UT22084-068-021-101797,folio:F.31.b,volume:V71}}} Thereby one will not become unimportant.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4369,id:UT22084-068-021-7230}}}“ ‘For monks or others of a similar kind, there are six causes that will instantaneously make others think of them as unimportant and despicable. Which are the six? Meaningless talk, thoughtless undertakings, continuous obsession with food, occupying the seats of elders, talking loudly about confidential matters, and chatter. Whoever engages in those six will instantly become unimportant and their happiness will be short-lived. Therefore, both monks and laypeople should give up those factors.
(9) Frivolity Is Remedied by Steadfastness
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4370,id:UT22084-068-021-7232}}}“ ‘There is also another highly staining and afflictive factor that must be overcome by means of unblemished factors: frivolity. Frivolity must be overcome, because it creates obstacles for the Dharma. By its very nature, it makes one unstable and extremely fickle, and one will find it hard to trust in the Dharma. One will be unable to comprehend the Dharma, one will fail to uphold it, and one will have no inhibitions. One’s conduct will not be restrained, one will not make declarations of one’s vows, one will not receive vows, and one will not gain realization or mundane understanding. One will fail to understand all the many paths of the world, one will not become energetic, one will become corrupted, and the flaws of corruption will stick. It is a safe way to render all one’s efforts futile and useless, both in terms of this world and the next. Therefore, monks and others of a similar kind must overcome frivolity.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4371,id:UT22084-068-021-7233}}}“ ‘How is that to be overcome? {{page:{number:1769,id:UT22084-068-021-101798,folio:F.32.a,volume:V71}}} By means of the virtuous factor of steadfastness. Steadfastness causes monks or others of a similar kind to be universally worshiped. With steadfast discipline, steadfast insight, steadfast intelligence, a guarded mind, and by seeking solitude, one will thoroughly conquer the realms of the māras. Journeying to the city of the transcendence of suffering, one will develop perfect virtuous qualities. All mundane objectives can be accomplished by the steadfast, and the steadfast receive the praises of the wise. The steadfast are capable with respect to matters of the world. The steadfast receive everyone’s veneration and are praised by all. Even hearing their names brings happiness. Such people accomplish any project they initiate. Therefore, such people whose minds are decisive, properly guarded, and endowed with steadfast intelligence receive the praises of worldly people. Whether one is a layperson or a monk, one must therefore give up frivolity and be steadfast, courageous, and insightful.’
(10) Poverty Is Remedied by Generosity
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4372,id:UT22084-068-021-7235}}}“In order to be of benefit, Musulundha will then continue addressing the speaking swans, the king of swans Auspicious Time, and the careless and crazed forces of the māras, teaching them the discourse of the blessed Kāśyapa, just as he has heard it from another god in the past: ‘There is also another miserable and defiling factor that everyone must relinquish and overcome completely. What is that? It is deficiency, which is twofold, {{page:{number:1770,id:UT22084-068-021-101799,folio:F.32.b,volume:V71}}} for there is deficiency in terms of insight as well as discipline. Deficiency is also twofold with respect to generosity and intelligence, just as there are two kinds with respect to family and view. One may likewise be deficient in terms of adhering to one’s vows or with respect to one’s guru. Or one may be deficient in terms of friends and family. All those forms of deficiency are to be completely rejected. A noble son or daughter, or the attendant of a noble son or daughter, must relinquish them all entirely.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4373,id:UT22084-068-021-7236}}}“ ‘What is the method that can overcome them all? Generosity. All by itself, generosity conquers all forms of deficiency. Analogously, all lamps illumine the dark, all types of insight destroy ignorance, and all beliefs are conquered by the true view. There is a factor of supreme beauty and magnificence that all wise people embrace, a factor whereby all the lower realms are relinquished, a factor that liberates from this world and into the beyond, a supreme factor that conquers all deficiencies. What factor is that? Generosity.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4374,id:UT22084-068-021-7237}}}“ ‘Generosity also takes many forms, and so there is generosity in terms of giving knowledge, discipline, Dharma, intelligence, guidance about the path, a bathing pond for washing away the afflictions of{{note:{index:532,id:UT22084-068-021-7238}}} the path, action, life, material things, freedom from fear, truth, and the dispelling of doubts. There is also a fivefold division in terms of giving freedom from affliction, {{page:{number:1771,id:UT22084-068-021-101800,folio:F.33.a,volume:V71}}} giving the opportunity to set forth, giving ordination, giving medicine to the ill, and giving vision. Such generosity liberates beyond the world and is like the mother and father of all benefactors. Such generosity, which is carried out through careful cultivation of mind and thought, conquers all forms of poverty and puts an end to the lower realms. One can thereby enjoy the happiness of gods and humans and, in the end, attain the transcendence of suffering. Such activity is therefore always to be pursued. Hence, the factor of poverty must be conquered by means of these supremely virtuous qualities in which all wise people delight wholeheartedly. Moreover, this is accomplished through perfection in terms of the act of giving, the attitude, the object, and the recipient.
(11) Ignorance Is Remedied by Knowledge
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4375,id:UT22084-068-021-7240}}}“ ‘There is also another dark factor that prevents good qualities and keeps one tied to cyclic existence. What is that? Ignorance. Wherever the darkness of unknowing exists, there one finds the many forms of ignorance. Ignorance forges the bonds for the entirety of cyclic existence—bonds that create a pitch-black darkness and further destructive bonds of clinging.{{note:{index:533,id:UT22084-068-021-7241}}} Ignorance is thoroughly restraining and resembles weapons, poison, and fire. All forms of ignorance are just like unknowing and are perpetuated by means of unknowing. Ignorance causes beings to roam through the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. Ignorance is nothing but bondage, and it traps sentient beings in a pit. How can one conquer that defiling enemy? One must do so by means of undefiled wakefulness, which shines like a lamp, offers refuge, protects, guides, {{page:{number:1772,id:UT22084-068-021-101801,folio:F.33.b,volume:V71}}} and acts like a parent toward all beings and like both a doctor and a medicine. Ignorance is overcome by means of that wakefulness, which thereby cuts through all fetters.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4376,id:UT22084-068-021-7242}}}“ ‘Once ignorance has been relinquished it will not recur, just like a tree that will no longer grow once it has been uprooted. Just as a tree will no longer grow if it has been burned by fire, and just as a stream that flows into a river will not return, in the same way ignorance will not recur once it has been curbed by undefiled wakefulness. Therefore, you must engender great diligence so that in all situations and at all times you will overcome all forms of ignorance by means of the full manifestation of wakefulness.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4377,id:UT22084-068-021-7243}}}“ ‘All those eleven factors are rooted in carelessness. They are all forms and variations of carelessness. Therefore, in all situations and by any means, carelessness should be wholeheartedly and completely relinquished. All types of failure grow from the root of carelessness; they emerge due to the presence of carelessness, and they occur only where carelessness is present. As an example, the ground supports all herbs, grass, forests, waters, grains, rivers, mountains, oceans, cities, towns, groves, parks, and even the majestic king of mountains. Similarly, all the sufferings of hell beings, starving spirits, and animals share the same single root of carelessness.

(1) Remorse
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4477,id:UT22084-068-021-7352}}}“ ‘How should one develop remorse? When one engages in delightful conduct, one may become mentally attached, which will then destroy any virtuous factors. How to remedy that? Monks should regard those who engage in unvirtuous actions of body, speech, and mind as revolting, they should rebuke them, and they should not keep company with those whose minds are preoccupied by attachments. Likewise, if they should themselves fall under the power of conditions and develop such thoughts, they must immediately overcome those thoughts and not relish them. Whatever they were carried away by they should confess in the presence of others, and endeavor and train so as to avoid any recurrence. In this way, they will ensure that they do not thereafter engage in such thinking. Monks perceive such unvirtuous thoughts like excrement or a dog’s corpse that is tied around their necks. They feel just as revolted as people who are obsessed with cleanliness feel when they encounter feces or a dog’s corpse. That is how disgusted monks feel by unvirtuous factors. {{page:{number:1790,id:UT22084-068-021-101819,folio:F.42.b,volume:V71}}} They reject them and regret them.

In the same way, if monks or people of a similar kind who adhere to virtue should give rise to an unvirtuous thought, they would condemn and deplore it and would make sure to train their minds and practice what is virtuous, so that whatever led them astray would not recur.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4479,id:UT22084-068-021-7354}}}“ ‘This is the first among those factors whereby gods and humans can overcome, destroy, and annihilate carelessness. Therefore, holy people who pursue insight into reality and are fearful of the terrors of cyclic existence should train like this, giving rise to remorse about even the subtlest forms of unvirtuous thought. Be heedful of this and do not become careless for even a moment, because the single root of all unvirtuous factors is relishing and being attached to things. That, then, is the first factor.
(2) Fear of the Lower Realms
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4480,id:UT22084-068-021-7356}}}“ ‘Fearing the lower realms is another factor that likewise causes virtue to increase.

Knowing that unvirtuous actions cause beings to be born as hell beings, starving spirits, or animals, such people will think, “I must not pursue unvirtuous factors because such unwholesomeness leads to a fall into misfortune.”
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4481,id:UT22084-068-021-7357}}}“ ‘If living beings resort to, become habituated to, and increase acts of even minor negativity, then that will make them take birth among hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. Therefore, monks, brahmins, or others of such kind should train so that fear of the lower realms may make them fearful of unvirtuous factors. The effects of unvirtuous actions ripen as the experience of life as a hell being, starving spirit, or animal. Therefore, careless gods of base minds who roam carelessly must develop fear of the lower realms, for when they are fearful of the lower realms, they will not remain careless. They will refrain from unvirtuous actions of body, speech, and mind. Every single day, they will practice virtuous actions and refrain from unwholesome ones. Such are the effects of fearing the lower realms. People who know their own strength and that of others will be able to eradicate all forms of poison, wild animals, precipices, and lethal dangers. {{page:{number:1792,id:UT22084-068-021-101821,folio:F.43.b,volume:V71}}} Likewise, fear of the realms of misfortune will make them avoid such factors as they occur, so that they may give them up, refrain from even subtle unvirtuous actions, and avoid being careless. By relinquishing those, they will then enjoy a divine or human life. They will pursue the path to the city of the transcendence of suffering, ensuring by all means that they attain this transcendence of suffering. They will attain a supreme happiness that is stainless, immutable, and undefiled.

Those three forms of suffering in the lower realms can also be further divided into ten in relation to the ten unvirtuous actions. Hence, fearing the lower realms, one will relinquish and refrain from such actions. One will not rejoice in them, nor will one mingle with people who engage in such actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4489,id:UT22084-068-021-7365}}}“ ‘This is how holy people give up all forms of unwholesome conduct and engage in the virtuous practices of holy people whose conduct is stainless and free from carelessness. Relinquishing all forms of existence that are caused by unwholesome conduct, and abandoning all unvirtuous actions, they are freed from all flaws. Those beings who are free from all flaws, free from all affliction, at ease, and sharp are able to cross the river of existence. Therefore, you must train in this, cultivating an understanding of the terrors of the lower realms. Through this further factor that is desirable, attractive, and delightful, all beings will reach the transcendence of suffering.

Patience is a supreme virtue, extremely auspicious, and extolled by the buddhas.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4491,id:UT22084-068-021-7368}}}“ ‘Moreover, there are two kinds of patience. {{page:{number:1794,id:UT22084-068-021-101823,folio:F.44.b,volume:V71}}} One type of patience is achieved by the unique virtuous qualities associated with the path of concentration when practiced in accordance with reality. Such a path is traversed by meditators who follow the path of the sameness of all phenomena. They develop patience as they live on the ground of this world, among the rocks, in forests, or in the jungle. It prevents them from becoming depressed. With such patience, they adhere to the factors that deliver all the qualities of the transcendence of suffering. This is the patience of those who attain what is stable, essential, real, unique, and foremost. They attain all virtuous factors as well as the path to the transcendence of suffering. By following the path of such a stable patience, they shall go beyond the world and attain the transcendence of suffering.

What is that? Observance. Observance is a quality that is becoming in all regards. A mendicant, brahmin, or someone else of that kind—be it a householder or a monastic, a child or an old person—is always beautiful when possessed of and immersed in observance. And whoever lacks observance is not. Such a person is like a jackal or a crow.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4574,id:UT22084-068-021-7465}}} “ ‘How is observance to be cultivated by a monastic? Here, there are seven aspects. What are the seven? A monastic should obtain clothing from a suitable refuse site where old garments that have been worn and discarded by householders can be obtained. In this way, a monastic should obtain garments that are stained, tattered, and torn. That is observance with respect to the garments of the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4575,id:UT22084-068-021-7466}}} “ ‘Observance of the gaze means that when a monk is on the road, he should look ahead as far as the length of a yoke, and when visiting the home of a donor and benefactor, he should look toward the ground. He should also maintain continuous recollection of the form of the Buddha. His faculties and entire body should be properly guarded. Keeping count of his inhalations and exhalations, he should move with mindfulness of the body. In this way, when in the home of a donor, he should not look at the amenities of that home. {{page:{number:1815,id:UT22084-068-021-101844,folio:F.55.a,volume:V71}}} He should not stare, and he should not entertain any thoughts about the females of the house. He should not hug the children and should not continuously move his legs. Nor should he keep moving his arms. He should not be restless on his seat and should not fiddle with his head or keep adjusting his Dharma garments. He should not massage his hands or play with his fingers. That is the second aspect of observance—a monk who observes these points observes the proper gaze.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4576,id:UT22084-068-021-7467}}} “ ‘There is also a third aspect of observance. When a monk enters the home of a donor or benefactor, he should wash his feet, clean his hands, and rinse his alms bowl. Once he has cleansed his bowl, he should sit down on his seat in a very humble frame of mind. While seated, he should place his alms bowl in its circular stand in front of his legs. With his right arm he should then properly lift up the bowl in his right hand and accept the alms. Having done that, he should partake of them as if they were medicine and without overeating. When eating, he should not open his mouth too wide, he should not munch or slurp, and he should be content with filling only a third of his stomach. He should not look at others’ bowls either. He should abstain from eating food he is especially fond of. He should ensure that what he eats does not become a cause of further carelessness. He should make sure to conclude the meal in the proper way and at the proper time, and then teach the Dharma with clear and composed faculties. When his mind is composed, he will be able to teach in a manner that is neither rushed nor slow, not overly direct or roundabout, {{page:{number:1816,id:UT22084-068-021-101845,folio:F.55.b,volume:V71}}} and also not too long, but cognizant of time and place. In this way, the monk should protect the mind of the benefactor. Thus, he will not fall prey to carelessness. That is the third type of observance.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4577,id:UT22084-068-021-7468}}} “ ‘When a monk obtains food, th,e sight of towns, cities, or markets should not preoccupy his mind and he should not give rise to any desires in that regard. His mind ought not to become distracted or excited thereby. In this way, he should avoid staying at dwellings that he has determined to be inappropriate. That is the fourth observance.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4578,id:UT22084-068-021-7469}}} “ ‘Observance in terms of detachment is to be unconcerned about one’s life and limb in all situations. Someone who possesses and carries lots of supplies and utensils is not a monk. A proper monk does not delight in busily traveling through the land. He does not adopt the costumes and garments of others, and he will not attach too much importance to what they announce. He also does not become fond of visiting just a single home. That is the fifth observance.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4579,id:UT22084-068-021-7470}}} “ ‘Moreover, someone who is observant of detachment does not cut wood or grass, nor does he break the earth. He does not keep several sets of shoes or clothes that he can alternate between. He does not scold people, even those whose discipline has degenerated. He is not interested in depending on alms from a king. He does not associate with monks who are burdened by arguments. That is the sixth observance.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4580,id:UT22084-068-021-7471}}} “ ‘Moreover, observance also refers to a monk who practices a mind of equality and so does what is beneficial. He escapes the realm of the māras with great diligence. {{page:{number:1817,id:UT22084-068-021-101846,folio:F.56.a,volume:V71}}} Seeking serenity and with his faculties subdued, he takes to mountainous retreats, caves, and unsheltered places in order to constantly abide by emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness.

The flaws of fickleness make their minds develop attachment. Fickleness causes them to churn in cyclic existence. Whether they are in a park or a temple for the saṅgha, or in a town, a city, or elsewhere, fickleness is always a cause of laziness. It makes them develop fondness for all sorts of things. If they stay in a hermitage, or some other peaceful location, they will find no joy in doing so. They do not travel well either, because when on the road, such people will remain neither monks nor householders. The same goes for all other situations. Even if they stay in one single place, they will pass their time without resting in the happiness of concentration, which was otherwise the reason they became monastics.

Due to their extremely weak mental abilities and their inability to stay in one place, they are destroyed as they constantly end up socializing and serving others. Marred by the flaws of instability, they become the laughingstock of others. Householders will talk about them, saying, ‘That mendicant or brahmin is unable to remain anywhere. {{page:{number:1823,id:UT22084-068-021-101852,folio:F.59.a,volume:V71}}} Overcome by fickleness, he gets excited about all sorts of things.’ Rather than staying in peaceful hermitages, such people are constantly involved in searching and hoarding. They are always eager to meet householders. They go to render them service and end up like domestic servants. Serving householders, they obey their commands. Therefore, they are neither successful householders, nor are they monastics, for they are destroyed by the flaws of fickleness. Whoever is free from such flaws will be offered riches by everyone, whereas those who are afflicted by such faults cannot escape the mockery of donors and benefactors.

Residing in mountainous retreats and always moving alone, they must make sure to avoid being undermined by fickleness for as long they are alive. They must stay alone and avoid becoming attached to anything. They must let go of all attachments. By giving up all attachments, they will achieve liberation. That is how fickleness is overcome.’

What is that? Recollection of death. When practicing, becoming habituated to, and increasing the recollection of death one understands that this suffering is encountered by absolutely all beings. Death is unstoppable and unavoidable for everyone. As death is absolutely certain, it will make one lose everything and separate from everything, no matter how agreeable and delightful it may otherwise be.

Riding on karmic actions, sentient beings thus follow the path where they have to taste the fruits of their own actions, and thus they take birth among hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. When beings are born and pass away, they may be completely without company, and yet at that time they will always be accompanied by their virtuous and unvirtuous karmic actions. Therefore, virtuous karmic actions are like one’s mother and father, and misdeeds are like one’s enemies, causing one to be born among hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. Therefore, positive actions are always to be carried out, whereas all misdeeds must be avoided. {{page:{number:1839,id:UT22084-068-021-101868,folio:F.67.a,volume:V71}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4678,id:UT22084-068-021-7592}}}“ ‘When the recollection of death is explained in this way, one will develop weariness and no longer be so attracted to objects. One will not be marred by desire, anger, or ignorance. Nor will one engage in unvirtuous actions for the sake of one’s children or spouse. Since even the minds of householders who fear death will calm down, there is no need to mention monastics. Monastics who remember death will never stray from their discipline. Nor will they develop any fondness for objects. Nor will they roam the land. Even if they do travel through the land, such monks will give up all distractions, including women, who are the root of all diversions, and all other such sources of distraction.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4679,id:UT22084-068-021-7593}}}“ ‘Recollecting death, they will think, “Were I to travel through the land, I would only be able to keep but a few virtuous factors in mind. Once I arrive at the place and time of my death, those factors will not be sufficient to help me or give me relief. When the assisting and piercing winds{{note:{index:552,id:UT22084-068-021-7594}}} take me to the time and place of my death, then what will be my refuge, who will protect me? Tied by the shackles of my own karmic actions, I will be led away and dragged into the next life. My mother, father, siblings, relatives, companions, and friends—none of them can protect me at the place and time of my death.”
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4680,id:UT22084-068-021-7595}}}“ ‘In that way, they cultivate the recollection of death, and whenever they do so, they also naturally develop fondness for generosity, discipline, and insight. Hence, karmic actions that are positive and virtuous will increase, and they will disengage from unvirtuous actions. {{page:{number:1840,id:UT22084-068-021-101869,folio:F.67.b,volume:V71}}} Based on such wholesome karmic actions, they will experience the happiness and enjoyments of gods and humans and ultimately attain the transcendence of suffering. Therefore, whether you are female or male, householder or monastic, mendicant or brahmin, you should understand those qualities and always remember death. People endowed with such mindfulness will fear the terrors of the Lord of Death, and thus they will disengage from all unvirtuous actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4681,id:UT22084-068-021-7596}}}“ ‘Cultivating this understanding, one then thinks, “All sentient beings are sure to die. Nowhere in the realms of gods, humans, hell beings, starving spirits, or animals is there any place that is not ruled by the Lord of Death.” Cultivating this understanding, one will be wary of the terrors that are to follow this life and so will not chase after sounds, textures, tastes, forms, or scents. One’s mind will not think in terms of things being permanent, stable, and enduring. Rather, one will be aware of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and the absence of self. When mindful of death, one will not be harmed by flaws but will always and continuously remain attentive to virtuous factors. Such mental activity will then increase.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4682,id:UT22084-068-021-7597}}}“ ‘When constantly practicing, becoming habituated to, and increasing the recollection of death, one will always keep these points in mind. One will think, “Nowhere at all is there anything that will not disintegrate, fall, split apart, or transform. Mount Sumeru towers majestically amid a hundred thousand delightful mountains, yet even that will be destroyed by the fire at the end of the eon. Ah, how could my body then possibly endure? The infinite ocean into which all rivers flow, the home of nāgas and asuras, {{page:{number:1841,id:UT22084-068-021-101870,folio:F.68.a,volume:V71}}} will certainly dry up when the seven suns blaze. What then can be said of my body? In short, the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm are all impermanent and unstable; they do not endure and are subject to transformation. So there is no need to mention that my body and life force are also impermanent and unstable, that they also do not endure and are subject to transformation.”
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4683,id:UT22084-068-021-7598}}}“ ‘As one contemplates that which is wholly and certainly virtuous with a mind that is constantly composed, such a practice will prevent any form of clinging. With a mind free from attachment, one will not be bound by desire or anger, and when desire and anger are continuously overcome, there will not be any ignorance. Freed from all flaws, one attains the supreme stage that knows no death, aging, or exhaustion whatsoever. Therefore, remain focused on the recollection of death. The best among all types of mindfulness is the mindfulness of death.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4684,id:UT22084-068-021-7599}}}“ ‘Cultivating the recollection of death also involves other qualities. When a mendicant or brahmin practices this recollection, he will understand that the body is like a casket of suffering. With an awareness of suffering he will then think, “When sickness and disease manifest, my body will be destroyed. What can I do once I am bound by the shackles of the Lord of Death? At that time, I will be unable to cultivate generosity, discipline, and insight. Therefore, until the Lord of Death arrives, {{page:{number:1842,id:UT22084-068-021-101871,folio:F.68.b,volume:V71}}} I shall make sure to cultivate generosity, discipline, and insight. The Lord of Death who kills the life force of all sentient beings will soon be here!” For mendicants and brahmins who thus keep in mind nothing but the recollection of death, such considerations will bear fruit and lead them to the final transcendence of suffering.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4685,id:UT22084-068-021-7600}}}“ ‘There is also another way of being mindful of death. What is that? Here one thinks as follows: “This aggregate of form is emptiness. This body is empty and impermanent. These conditioned factors are all impermanent, painful, empty, and devoid of self. They are always in rapid motion, and thus they constantly shift and deteriorate. They are nothing, void, empty, and insubstantial, resembling a spinning waterwheel and a city of gandharvas. Alas, all these conditioned factors, including my own body and life force, are just like foam and bubbles of water—they have no essence and are like a city of gandharvas. Any moment, without exception, might very well be the occasion for the terror of my death. Therefore, I must now do what is meaningful: I must cultivate the three kinds of virtuous action, give up the three kinds of unvirtuous action, and be mindful of death. That is what mendicants and brahmins cherish. I must train so that I am mindful of this fact.” ’

Freedom from infatuation with one’s body, family, and nobility. Childish beings who are infatuated and attached to their bodies, family, and nobility will engage in negative bodily activities. And just as this applies to physical actions, so it applies to verbal and mental actions. Hence, due to such causes and conditions, these people will, upon the disintegration of their bodies, suffer an inauspicious fall and be born in the hells. Likewise, they will obtain lives as animals and take birth in the realms of starving spirits. As they keep changing lives, they will experience myriad sufferings of various kinds—it is hard to even know all their names! Therefore, recognize these terrifying flaws and do not be infatuated with your body, family, or nobility. In this way, you will avoid misdeeds of body, speech, and mind.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4702,id:UT22084-068-021-7620}}}“ ‘Seeing the body as it is means acknowledging that it is impermanent, painful, empty, and devoid of self. It is fake, hollow, and insubstantial; a vessel of impurities that contains hair, body hair, nails, teeth, blood, skin, and so on; a bone frame that is filled with muscles, fat, urine, and excrement. This body is not clean to begin with, nor is it clean in the middle or the end. A product of karmic actions and affliction, it possesses no essence whatsoever. It does not last and does not contain a self. At the place and time of one’s death this body cannot accompany one for even a single step. Rather, it ends up being cremated in the charnel ground {{page:{number:1845,id:UT22084-068-021-101874,folio:F.70.a,volume:V71}}} or consumed by vultures, owls, jackals, crows, or the like. Holy people who contemplate these matters will give up or curb any form of infatuation with the body and nobility.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4703,id:UT22084-068-021-7621}}}“ ‘Likewise, if infatuation with their family should arise in mendicants or brahmins due to the thought “I was born into a good family,” they will proceed to examine and investigate what family really is. They will then realize that ultimately there is no such thing as family; it is entirely a conceptual construct that childish people believe in. Families do not truly exist because they lack causes. The same goes for one’s parental lineage—there is no such thing. Only through virtuous causes can one join a high family. What are those causes? They are the qualities of truth, discipline, generosity, insight, serenity, and gentleness. Through such causes, even those who belong to a low family will take birth in an important family. The reason is that family depends on one’s qualities, not on one’s birth. Therefore, mendicants, brahmins, or others of similar pedigree must not get elated about their birth, family, or nobility.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4704,id:UT22084-068-021-7622}}}“ ‘Mendicants, brahmins, or kindred spirits also investigate the nature of the body in a different way. They say to themselves: “This body that I now possess has been mine since I was an infant, and as I have aged. However, the body of the infant that was lying on its back is not the body of the crawling baby. The body of the crawling baby is not that of the child whose hair was shaven, and the body of the child whose hair was shaven is not that of the youth. {{page:{number:1846,id:UT22084-068-021-101875,folio:F.70.b,volume:V71}}} The body of the young adult is not that of a person who might die suddenly, nor is it the body of a person who might die after a long time has passed. Once my body has turned into a corpse, ants and other such creatures will devour it, and it will be ravaged by the wind, sun, and rain. The myriad fragments of it will end up strewn over all the ten directions. Once I have been carted off to the charnel ground, my body will be sundered into numerous different parts. Some will take off with my bones, some will take my skull, some my neck bones, some my nose, some my elbows, some my shoulders, some my fingers, some my nails, some my ribs, some my back, some my spine, some my thighs, some the bones of my feet, some my toes.” In this way, by correctly discerning the different parts of one’s body, one will not develop any infatuation based on one’s body.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4705,id:UT22084-068-021-7623}}}“ ‘What type of perspective and understanding will make infatuation with nobility disappear? Such infatuation vanishes when it is correctly understood that everyone depends on extraneous factors, and that no one is independent. Everyone is subject to numerous factors other than themselves, so how could they be independent? All these conditioned phenomena that depend on other factors are thoroughly influenced by external factors. That is to say, {{page:{number:1847,id:UT22084-068-021-101876,folio:F.71.a,volume:V71}}} they all arise based on causes and conditions. Consider, for example, a house. A so-called house is a mere convention that applies to a gathering of numerous factors, such as the roof, that are all interdependent and mutually reliant. Similarly, the aggregate of form that is referred to as a body becomes known as such due to the coming together of skin, flesh, bones, and fat. No god or creator is involved. Such is the aggregate of form that is referred to as a body. When mendicants, brahmins, or other kindred spirits examine matters in this way and investigate the body in accordance with the way things really are, they will free themselves from, or otherwise curb, any infatuation with their bodies, family, and nobility.

Later, such people may regard matters in a way that accords with reality, and they will then realize that family is a mere notion. In this way, the blind will come to comprehend the nature of reality. They will then come to regard those who are endowed with insight, discipline, and generosity as members of the pure family. They will understand that childish beings become arrogant in the absence of that family. For example, mendicants, brahmins, and others like them will, by understanding family in a way that accords with reality, become utterly free from infatuation with family, and they may also curb such infatuation.’

The mind is fickle and engages fleetingly and without stability. Therefore, when a desirous state of mind crops up, mendicants and brahmins contemplate the repulsive nature of things; when an aggressive state occurs, they cultivate love; and when a deluded state of mind manifests, they contemplate dependent origination. Directing their minds in these three remedial ways, they come to regard all beings from a perspective of impartiality. Without considering them as either friend or enemy, but rather as equal, they develop an intelligence that is unburdened and bright, and so they move without hesitation and remain perfectly pure and happy. They sleep delightfully at night, are happy and awake during the day, and the gods protect them. They also develop great mastery and become highly powerful. When their minds brighten in this fashion, their blood is purified as well. When their blood is purified, their countenance also brightens, and when their complexion is bright, their physical form becomes lovely to behold. They become beautiful people who appear delightful, attractive, and desirable to everyone. Due to the karmic effects of regarding all beings from a perspective of equality, such people will, when their bodies disintegrate and they have died, go to the joyous higher realms and be born among the gods.

Contentment is a most cherished factor that bestows happiness and satisfies body and mind. Mendicants and brahmins who have contentment as their friend and protector enjoy supreme happiness. Those who are content in all situations will always enjoy the greatest happiness. They do not become attached to delightful, attractive, or desirable sights.

Rather, they discern sounds with an awareness of the way they really are. They recognize that while sounds are not permanent, not enjoyable, and do not involve any self, childish beings who are destroyed by nothing but thinking nevertheless conceive of and become attached to sounds as sources of enjoyment. Sounds, the objects of the ears, thus thoroughly disturb the minds of childish beings. By correctly and repeatedly bringing these matters to mind, they come to see things as they are and thus develop genuine joy. By discerning sounds in accordance with their real nature, they realize that they are void, empty, without continuity, and without essence. But while there is not the slightest essence to sound, childish beings in cyclic existence, who are ruined by their own thinking, believe otherwise. When sounds are considered in this way, one will not be distracted by even the most delightful, attractive, or desirable sound. Rather, through contentment one will attain perfect happiness.

Contentment itself makes them happy, and contentment ensures that they are not led astray. They do not develop attachments internally. Rather, they think of taste in accordance with the way things really are. They recognize that by the nature of things, taste does not possess any essence and is neither stable nor enduring or unchanging. So-called “delicious taste” is simply an idea in the minds of sentient beings who are ruined by desirous thoughts. When they discern taste in accordance with reality, they do not develop any attachments to taste. They do not become polluted and will not mentally crave for the experience of taste.

What is that? {{page:{number:1860,id:UT22084-068-021-101889,folio:F.77.b,volume:V71}}} Weariness of the objects. Mendicants and brahmins also regard the objects in the following way. When their eyes see a form, and when visual consciousness and mental experience manifest, they discern the event and so give up the desirous pursuit of delightful objects. They are wary of any desirous pursuit of objects that will bind their minds. In this way, they must cut through desirous pursuits. They must cause craving to evaporate.

The afflictions achieve nothing good for oneself and do not lead to happiness. Rather, for all beings, they are the universal bonds. When monks or brahmins understand this about the objects, they will not give rise to any desirous pursuits in their minds. They separate from such pursuits and cast them off.

When one regards objects in accordance with the way things really are, correct mental engagements will become dominant while incorrect mental engagements will be absent. The craving that accompanies lustful desire will no longer be present and, as that is extinguished, purification is achieved. Free from the contaminating afflictions and the associated stains of unwholesomeness, one becomes blissful in all regards. Therefore, mendicants, brahmins, and others must first of all overcome the negative factors that take the form of a covetous pursuit of objects. They must always discern the virtuous qualities and overcome all negative and unwholesome qualities. In that way, the ear’s hearing of sounds will correctly engender forms of consciousness that are exclusively virtuous. {{page:{number:1862,id:UT22084-068-021-101891,folio:F.78.b,volume:V71}}}

The arising of the olfactory consciousness is conditioned by the nose and smell, and when these give rise to mental engagements, such mental engagements may have an unvirtuous nature. In such a case, mendicants or brahmins will understand as follows: “These unvirtuous and unwholesome qualities have now arisen. Their presence will bring misfortune upon me, so I shall give up these unfortunate factors.” As they proceed to give up the relevant unvirtuous mental engagements, they discern matters in accordance with reality. Accordingly, at that point they give rise to correct mental activity, and as such proper mental engagements manifest, they conquer the craving that accompanies lustful desire. When they continue to examine smells in this way, they become in all regards free from attachments to smell and the process of successfully conquering attachment brings them joy.

When in possession of genuine knowledge, their consciousness that registers taste will no longer be tied by craving for desirous pleasure. Liberated from that, they will be endowed with the highest happiness.

Wondering what karmic actions cause beings to take birth in that realm, he will apply insight derived from hearing or use the divine eye. He will then notice how great beings, holy people who practice virtues and are honest and sincere and endowed with constant discipline, may give up killing and stealing, just as before. As for their abandonment of sexual misconduct, such people are careful even with respect to statues of females and will not ogle them by improperly engaging the mind in a way that is ridden with lust.

Around the lake live many different colorful birds, resplendent like the seven precious substances, that display their beauty and sing delightfully. The Rājanina lake is also a venue for a hundred thousand gods, each of whom is surrounded by a retinue of at least several hundred goddesses.

Since the gods of the Heaven of the Four Great Kings and the Heaven of the Thirty-Three have not given up sexual misconduct, when they are about to die, new gods will therefore be born among their goddesses. In this way, when their lights begin to fade, like oil lamps that are about to burn out, and their lives are drawing to an end, they will be abandoned by their goddesses, who will instead pair up with a newly born god and begin to play, enjoy themselves, and carouse with him. The god who is about to die will therefore pass away while experiencing the excruciating pangs of jealousy. That in itself is an exceptionally great hell, and when such mental flaws culminate, that also becomes a further cause for taking rebirth in hell.

At that point the departing gods will be struck by agony as they think, “I am about to be destroyed by the winds of karmic action.” The suffering of the hells cannot match even a fraction of the pain that the gods feel at that point. The gods also experience a fourth suffering, for as they approach death, they begin to perceive the world of their coming birth and the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, or animals into which they will be born. At that point they experience a regret that burns like fire. There is also a fifth great suffering of the gods. When spiritual teachers explained the Dharma, they did not listen, and without practicing the sacred Dharma, they lived carelessly, their minds captured by objects.

The Thirty Qualities of Listening to the Dharma

At that time, I heard this Dharma from the blessed Kanakamuni. Based on that teaching, I am now teaching in the same way by means of this delightful, loud voice to those who have one-pointed minds. This voice has likewise made the gods with their attending goddesses give up their careless abandon and come to dwell here. It has caused them to heedfully listen to the Dharma. It causes them to listen to the true Dharma from an authentic person who does what is beneficial. And those who respond with respect when the Dharma is taught become destined for the transcendence of suffering. Their joy and happiness will abound. Their defilements will be exhausted. In both this world and the next, such holy people bring forth the merit of Brahmā. Acting properly, they will cause others to embrace the Dharma. They extinguish defilements. They act properly in all regards as they teach the Dharma. Those who make one hear the true Dharma are equal to one’s mother and father. They teach the Dharma of deliverance from cyclic existence. They teach the Dharma that causes ultimate and virtuous qualities to increase and so they are equal to one’s mother and father. A teacher of the true Dharma is a giver of Dharma—a Dharma benefactor. He is a communicator of the Dharma who proclaims the teachings so that listeners may hear them.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4860,id:UT22084-068-021-7796}}}“ ‘Those who listen when the Dharma is thus spoken, and respond with diligence, {{page:{number:1888,id:UT22084-068-021-101917,folio:F.91.b,volume:V71}}} sincerity, and respect for the sacred Dharma, will achieve thirty qualities due to their wish to listen to the Dharma from those who proclaim it. What are the thirty? When in the presence of a Dharma teacher, a proclaimer of the Dharma, a Dharma benefactor, someone who is equal to one’s father and mother, and someone who is not a cause of cyclic existence, one will (1) hear the Dharma that one has not heard before, (2) understand what one hears, (3) discern what one understands, (4) accomplish what one discerns, (5) practice what one has adopted, (6) establish others in that which one observes, (7) develop discernment by listening to the Dharma, (8) be unaffected by decline, (9) give rise to roots of virtue that did not exist previously, (10) cause them to mature, (11) liberate those who are matured, (12) establish those with wrong view in the authentic view, (13) overcome all unvirtuous thoughts, (14) cultivate all virtuous thoughts, (15) relinquish negativities that arise by the force of conditions, (16) develop carefulness, (17) follow holy people, (18) overcome deceit and stinginess, (19) be respectful to one’s parents, (20) understand karmic actions and their effects, (21) cultivate activity that increases one’s lifespan, (22) be praised by the people of the world, (23) be protected by the gods, (24) have excellent intentions, (25) possess the wealth of being endowed with the Dharma, {{page:{number:1889,id:UT22084-068-021-101918,folio:F.92.a,volume:V71}}} (26) be free from laziness, (27) be diligent and grateful, (28) continuously cultivate the recollection of death, (29) be free from regrets at the time of death, and, finally, (30) go completely beyond suffering. These are the thirty qualities that are achieved by listening to someone who is endowed with the Dharma and who is equal to one’s father and mother, a Dharma benefactor who proclaims the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4861,id:UT22084-068-021-7797}}}“ ‘Such a teacher is one’s father because he benefits one in ultimate and infinite ways. Such a Dharma teacher, who is pure, bright, helpful, and who imparts understanding to others, carries out the activities of the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha. He liberates beings from cyclic existence. When one listens to the Dharma before such a speaker of the Dharma, a proclaimer of the Dharma, all such effects will occur.
(1) Hearing the Dharma That One Has Not Heard Before
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4862,id:UT22084-068-021-7799}}}“ ‘Those who have engaged in cyclic existence since time without beginning will, upon hearing the Dharma from such a Dharma speaker, be struck with wonder at hearing the Dharma that they have not heard previously. How is that wonder felt? Think of someone who is blind due to an eye disorder. If that person is cured by a skilled doctor, he will become overjoyed and ecstatic upon seeing the many features of the landscape. At that point, he can directly see numerous delightful forms that he has never encountered or even heard about before. Likewise, when beings who have roamed in cyclic existence since time without beginning understand the meaning taught by a teacher of the sacred Dharma, they become able to see the colorful features of the joyous and delightful landscape of the branches of awakening. As the meaning of the discourses is conveyed, they see it all and so feel completely overjoyed. Their joy is similar to that of a blind person who gains eyesight. {{page:{number:1890,id:UT22084-068-021-101919,folio:F.92.b,volume:V71}}} That is the first quality.
(2) Understanding What One Hears
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4863,id:UT22084-068-021-7801}}}“ ‘When hearing the true Dharma from the teachers, one will gain understanding. It is by listening to the true Dharma that one becomes able to comprehend it. If one has any doubts with regard to the meanings explained, one can ask others about those points. Inquiring into the subject matter that one has been taught by others, one becomes able to comprehend, consider, internalize, and acquaint oneself with the meaning. One will understand the relation between successive topics and contemplate them. Doing so, one will repeatedly consider those points. Contemplating the meaning in this way brings joy. The more one pays attention, the better one will be able to understand the profound meaning. That is the second quality that is achieved when one listens to teachers of the Dharma as they explain what one had previously not heard.
(3) Discerning What One Understands
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4864,id:UT22084-068-021-7803}}}“ ‘There is also a third quality that is achieved when one discerns what one has understood. One will now be able to identify the various points and their intent. One will comprehend the general meaning, which the blessed ones have taught in consideration of those to be trained. One will discern the subject matter that was heard, connect the various points, and remain attentive to them. Discerning their sequence is very precious and will ultimately lead to the transcendence of suffering. That is the third quality that is achieved by listening to teachers of the Dharma.
(4) Accomplishing What One Discerns
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4865,id:UT22084-068-021-7805}}}“ ‘There is also a fourth quality: {{page:{number:1891,id:UT22084-068-021-101920,folio:F.93.a,volume:V71}}} as one discerns the Dharma teachings and becomes able to understand their successive meanings, one will also accomplish them. Accomplishment here refers to the accomplishment of physical, verbal, and mental activities, thus engaging in, cultivating, and increasing the three virtues. In this way, one accomplishes what was explained. As the mind brightens, one is able to discern the individual words, implications, and relations. By discerning the teachings in this way, one will not misunderstand them. As one thus discovers this unprecedented meaning, one will strive to deal with the afflictions. Likewise, one will strive to deal with the bonds and fetters, and thus one will accomplish numerous qualities, as well as discipline, insight, and generosity. With a unique intention, one develops generosity, discipline, and insight. This is the fourth quality that ensues from attending to, cultivating, and increasing the proclamation of the sacred Dharma.
(5) Practicing What One Has Adopted
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4866,id:UT22084-068-021-7807}}}“ ‘There is also a fifth quality that arises from properly listening to and engaging with the proclamation of the sacred Dharma: by means of the threefold activity, one will develop tremendous steadfastness and become settled in the Dharma-Vinaya. Mendicants, brahmins, and householders will then say, “The noble son known as so-and-so genuinely practices the Dharma-Vinaya. What he does is in accord with what he says.” In this way, one will cause both oneself and others to practice the Dharma-Vinaya. By observing that, one will overcome and eliminate trillions and trillions of lives, and eons within cyclic existence. {{page:{number:1892,id:UT22084-068-021-101921,folio:F.93.b,volume:V71}}} One will bring an end to hundreds of thousands of lives as a hell being or starving spirit. That is another great quality that ensues from hearing, attending to, cultivating, and discerning the proclamation of the Dharma. Those who listen to the Dharma deeply cherish those who proclaim the Dharma. Since such people reveal the transcendence of suffering, they are truly like buddhas. Those who proclaim the sacred Dharma in accordance with the Dharma and in a way that establishes others in the Dharma—such teachers of the sacred Dharma—are to be cherished, respected, and trusted. Since they are free from deceit, they must be accepted as teachers.
(6) Establishing Others in That Which One Observes
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4867,id:UT22084-068-021-7809}}}“ ‘What is the sixth quality of listening to the Dharma? Establishing others in that which one observes and causing them to develop faith. In this way, one will eliminate the manifold sufferings they would otherwise experience during lives as a hell being or a starving spirit, and one will turn them into proper vessels for the Dharma. One will cause them to develop sadness about cyclic existence, instruct them about how to gain happiness, and speak to them about suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Thus, one will create merit in both oneself and others. In terms of one’s own being, one achieves great merit because one’s actions benefit others. The more one declares the Dharma, the deeper one’s insight grows and the more one’s afflictions will be exhausted. Once all afflictions are exhausted, one will go completely beyond suffering. Such are the qualities that ensue from the proclamation of the Dharma.
(7) Being Unaffected by Decline{{note:{index:562,id:UT22084-068-021-7811}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4868,id:UT22084-068-021-7812}}}“ ‘There is also a seventh quality that is achieved by attending to, cultivating, and increasing the proclamation of the Dharma. What is that? Not being depressed due to decline. {{page:{number:1893,id:UT22084-068-021-101922,folio:F.94.a,volume:V71}}} When one hears about the ripening of the effects of karmic actions, one will not become depressed in the face of decline. One will avoid doing what should not be done, avoid saying what should not be said, and avoid thinking what should not be thought. The courage of such a mind will not wane. That is the seventh quality that ensues from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma.
(8) Developing Discernment of the Characteristics of the Dharma{{note:{index:563,id:UT22084-068-021-7814}}}
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4869,id:UT22084-068-021-7815}}}“ ‘The proclamation of the sacred Dharma also has an eighth quality, manifesting as one discerns the characteristics of the Dharma: being free from pride by means of special insight achieved from knowledge, study, discipline, or insight. In this way, one clarifies unclear points in the explanation. That is the eighth quality associated with the proclamation of the sacred Dharma.
(9) Giving Rise to Roots of Virtue That Did Not Exist Previously
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4870,id:UT22084-068-021-7817}}}“ ‘One also gives rise to roots of virtue that did not exist previously because, upon hearing the proclamation of the Dharma, roots of virtue that had hitherto not been brought forth will manifest. Roots of virtue are engendered through a wish for the Dharma teaching in the same way that seeds sown in a field will sprout. Those of fervent diligence develop roots of virtue because when they go to listen to the proclamation of the Dharma, the seeds of roots of virtue that they receive through their ears will be sown in the fields of their minds. When the seeds of the Dharma are thus planted in the fields of their ears, they are protected from any terrifying starvation and suffering that abounds in the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. Therefore, the proclamation of the Dharma offers such protection and overcomes such suffering. It eliminates all chasms, liberates from all terrors, {{page:{number:1894,id:UT22084-068-021-101923,folio:F.94.b,volume:V71}}} and takes one all the way to the stage of unsurpassable, supreme peace. In this way, one enters the transcendence of suffering. Therefore, proclaiming the Dharma amounts to performing the deeds of the buddhas. The proclamation of the sacred Dharma in that manner is endowed with even more qualities because when one attends continuous teachings of the sacred Dharma, offers respect and veneration, and practices the teachings, one will receive protection. This is the gateway to escape from cyclic existence.
(10) Causing the Roots of Virtue to Mature
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4871,id:UT22084-068-021-7819}}}“ ‘There is yet another quality that ensues from the proclamation of the Dharma. What is that? Enhancing the roots of virtue so as to make them grow and ripen. Those who with great diligence continuously attend teachings of the Dharma will experience the ripening of their roots of virtue. For example, when seeds have been sown in a field, they will be ripened by sunshine and seasonal changes. Similarly, roots of virtue will be ripened by the sun of insight. Therefore, the sacred Dharma should be taught and listened to, always and continuously.
(11) Liberating Those Who Are Matured
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4872,id:UT22084-068-021-7821}}}“ ‘There is yet another quality that ensues from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma. What is that? Liberating those who are matured. When the roots of virtue ripen in one’s mind, the causal factors of constantly attending to teachings, retaining them, discerning them, and accomplishing the teachings will purify one’s mindstream, and in this way the afflictions are overcome. As the exhaustion of the afflictions occurs, one is liberated. Those who are liberated have no attachments. They think, “My births are over now. I have engaged in pure conduct. My works are done. {{page:{number:1895,id:UT22084-068-021-101924,folio:F.95.a,volume:V71}}} I do not perceive any further existences of mine.” All those qualities are due to the proclamation of the Dharma. Therefore, one should continuously listen to the Dharma.
(12) Establishing Those with Wrong View in the Authentic View
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4873,id:UT22084-068-021-7823}}}“ ‘There is yet another causal quality that brings about liberation. What is that? Establishing those with wrong view in the authentic view. Since time without beginning, unwholesome actions in cyclic existence have caused beings to remain in error and pursue unwholesome learning. Unwholesome learning also causes birth in the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. When one listens to the sacred Dharma and abides by, cultivates, and increases the proclamation of the sacred Dharma, any adherence to, cultivation of, and increase of wrong views will be avoided. At that time there will be perfect happiness, and one will develop undeceptive and true wakefulness.
(13) Overcoming All Unvirtuous Thoughts
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4874,id:UT22084-068-021-7825}}}“ ‘Therefore, when attending to, cultivating, and increasing the proclamation of the sacred Dharma there is yet another quality to be achieved. What is that? All present unvirtuous thoughts will be overcome. When attending to, cultivating, and increasing the proclamation of the sacred Dharma one will achieve further qualities, because even if slightly unvirtuous thoughts arise in one’s mind, one will apply a remedy to decisively overcome them. In this way, when a thought of desire is present, one decisively remedies that with repulsiveness. When a thought of anger is present, one decisively remedies that with love. If a thought of ignorance arises, one remedies that by contemplating dependent origination. {{page:{number:1896,id:UT22084-068-021-101925,folio:F.95.b,volume:V71}}} Those three remedies all stem from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma. By means of hearing, one is therefore able to remedy all three roots of nonvirtue, so it goes without saying that the more subtle, subsidiary afflictions will also be remedied thereby. This, then, is an additional quality that ensues from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4875,id:UT22084-068-021-7826}}}“ ‘The sacred Dharma conquers unvirtuous thoughts. Just as the sun vanquishes darkness, insight dispels all the darkness of the afflictions, because the forces of the sacred Dharma are powerful, and the forces of affliction are weak. Nevertheless, those forces cannot be conquered by anything but the proclamation of the sacred Dharma. This is another quality that ensues from the proclamation of the Dharma.
(14) Cultivating All Virtuous Thoughts
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4876,id:UT22084-068-021-7828}}}“ ‘The proclamation of the Dharma also engenders another quality. What is that? The cultivation of present virtuous mind states. This is another quality because the proclamation of the sacred Dharma not only overcomes unvirtuous factors, it also increases virtuous ones. The factor that enhances virtuous thoughts is insight. For example, when a small flame emerges, it will blaze if it is accompanied by straw, twigs, and so forth, as well as the wind. Likewise, when a small root of virtue emerges it can be enhanced by insight, {{page:{number:1897,id:UT22084-068-021-101926,folio:F.96.a,volume:V71}}} and thus even a single moment of virtuous mind—arisen from hearing the meaning of the Dharma—can continue for hundreds of thousands of eons without ever being exhausted. This also enables one to go beyond birth. Therefore, as you understand these benefits, you should listen diligently to the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4877,id:UT22084-068-021-7829}}}“ ‘There is no savior apart from the Dharma. Generosity ensues from listening to the Dharma. Thus, the Dharma turns one into a benefactor. Expertise follows from hearing the Dharma and adhering to it. Insight issues from hearing the Dharma. Therefore, as you hear about and come to see these qualities, you should pursue the Dharma that is the cause of deliverance. Listen diligently for as long as you live. This is the supreme among all saviors. Since the proclamation of the sacred Dharma thus causes one to escape from the suffering of existence, it is supreme.
(15) Relinquishing Negativities That Arise by the Force of Conditions
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4878,id:UT22084-068-021-7831}}}“ ‘There is yet another quality that ensues from the proclamation of the Dharma. What is that? Relinquishing negativities that arise by the force of conditions. Whenever unvirtuous conditions manifest, one will come to witness the terrors of the lower realms. Hence, such conditions must be discarded. Those who exercise proper judgement are frightened by the terrors of cyclic existence, and those who understand reality therefore give up unvirtuous factors that arise due to conditions. They do not engage with such factors. In order to prevent the arising of such factors, they develop discipline and insight. If they become motivated by the pursuit of wealth and honor, they will overcome that by means of generosity. Any stains of stinginess they conquer by means of detachment. Ignorance they conquer with insight. Thoughts they remedy by seeing things as they are. Non-Buddhist discourse they overcome with reasoned discourse. Inauthentic thought they remedy with authentic thought. {{page:{number:1898,id:UT22084-068-021-101927,folio:F.96.b,volume:V71}}} Thoughts of pleasure they overcome with thoughts of suffering. Thoughts of no emptiness they overcome by means of thoughts of emptiness. Thoughts of self they overcome with thoughts of no self. In this way, by means of thoughts associated with the true remedies, they give up unwholesomeness. All that arises from conditions they give up—whether extremely subtle, coarse, or middling. At all times and occasions, such unvirtuous conditions are relinquished by hearing the sacred Dharma, not by not hearing it. The proclamation of the sacred Dharma is like a foundation for all forms of fortune.
(16) Developing Carefulness
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4879,id:UT22084-068-021-7833}}}“ ‘The proclamation of the sacred Dharma also involves another quality. What is that? Developing carefulness. Carefulness is achieved when thoughts are relinquished. In this way, all fortune is achieved. How, then, does one overcome carelessness? Exclusively through the proclamation of the Dharma, because carelessness is relinquished upon hearing about the defects of carelessness. Those who achieve carefulness through the proclamation of the sacred Dharma also achieve mastery of their five senses. As they compose their five senses, their minds will not be harmed by inappropriate mental activities. Instead, they will constantly engage in proper mental activities. Gratified by proper mental activities, they achieve the highest happiness, because all afflictions are rooted in carelessness and all factors of awakening are based on carefulness. Therefore, since it remedies against carelessness, you must pursue nothing but the proclamation of the Dharma, cultivating it again and again and increasing it. {{page:{number:1899,id:UT22084-068-021-101928,folio:F.97.a,volume:V71}}}
(17) Following Holy People
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4880,id:UT22084-068-021-7835}}}‘There is yet another quality that ensues from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma. What is that? Following holy people. One follows holy people based on hearing the sacred Dharma. One follows them with joy and keeps company with them. The greatest of all joys is mental equanimity. The best of all qualities ensues from following holy people. Following holy people is the best of all qualities. Accompanying unholy people is the foremost of all flaws. Moreover, following holy people means following the sacred Dharma, and nothing else. Therefore, following holy people is also the supreme among all aspects of pure conduct. In this way one will follow holy people.
(18) Overcoming Deceit and Stinginess
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4881,id:UT22084-068-021-7837}}}“ ‘There is yet another quality that ensues from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma. What is that? Overcoming deceit and stinginess. What qualities are achieved based on following holy people? There are numerous such qualities, but, among all of them, the ability to overcome deceit and stinginess based on hearing about the ripening of the results of such actions is a most special quality. What happens to the deceitful and the stingy? When their bodies disintegrate and they die, they suffer an inauspicious fall into the lower realms, where they are born among starving spirits or hell beings. However, when the sacred Dharma is proclaimed and one comes to hear about the ripening of actions, one will overcome the proliferation of deceit and stinginess. One will lament{{note:{index:564,id:UT22084-068-021-7838}}} those factors, and should one fall into ordinariness, one will resent, lament,{{note:{index:565,id:UT22084-068-021-7839}}} and confess that. If others become deceitful and stingy, {{page:{number:1900,id:UT22084-068-021-101929,folio:F.97.b,volume:V71}}} one will seek to stop them, express resentment for that, inspire them to confess, and establish them on the path of virtue. All those qualities ensue from listening to the proclamation of the Dharma. Therefore, for human beings, the proclamation of the sacred Dharma is most crucial.
(19) Being Respectful to One’s Parents
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4882,id:UT22084-068-021-7841}}}“ ‘There is yet another quality that ensues from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma. What is that? Having respect for one’s parents. When hearing the sacred Dharma, one becomes aware of the ripening of karmic actions and the qualities of the fields. And one’s mother and father constitute a supreme field. When one gains trust regarding the effects of karmic actions, and when one cultivates that trust, one will worship one’s parents. One will supply them with medical remedies and household articles. Whenever one makes offerings to one’s parents, one achieves the merit of Brahmā. Such acts cause the attainment of the transcendence of suffering. Yet another quality follows from worshiping one’s parents based on the proclamation of the sacred Dharma. One thereby receives everyone’s praises. In this life, one’s parents will bring one praise, and upon the disintegration of one’s body, one will after death next be born among the gods in the joyous higher realms. Also, based on such causes and conditions, one will ultimately go completely beyond suffering. Therefore, perceiving all those qualities, wise people will respect their parents throughout their lives. Staying clear of other mindsets or modes of conduct, they develop mental equipoise and thus practice observantly.
(20) Understanding Karmic Actions and Their Effects
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4883,id:UT22084-068-021-7843}}}“ ‘There is yet another quality that ensues from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma. {{page:{number:1901,id:UT22084-068-021-101930,folio:F.98.a,volume:V71}}} What is that? Understanding karmic actions and their effects. Only the proclamation of the sacred Dharma, and nothing else, will make one see the reality of karmic actions and their effects. Thereby, one will understand as follows: “When an unvirtuous mind maintains an unwholesome observation, it is unvirtuous,” or “When a virtuous mind maintains a wholesome observation, it is virtuous.” In this way, one correctly understands karmic actions and their effects. Any form of unvirtuous mind will in the future have unattractive and unpleasant ripening, thus leading to birth in the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. If one engages in a flawed verbal act, one will think, “Unvirtuous actions such as this bring a ripening that is unattractive, unpleasant, and ugly. They bring birth among hell beings, starving spirits, and animals.” Should one engage in a flawed physical act, one will likewise think, “Unvirtuous actions such as this bring a ripening that is unattractive, unpleasant, and ugly. They bring birth among hell beings, starving spirits, and animals.” Such knowledge of these three types of karmic ripening is exclusively achieved by means of the proclamation of the Dharma, and nothing else. Therefore, one should listen to the proclamation of the Dharma by holy people for as long as one is alive. For as long as one listens to the sacred Dharma, one will be engaged in positive action and have given up flawed acts.

{{milestone:{label:4.C.4884,id:UT22084-068-021-7845}}}“ ‘There is yet another quality that ensues from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma. What is that? Cultivating activity that increases one’s lifespan. {{page:{number:1902,id:UT22084-068-021-101931,folio:F.98.b,volume:V71}}} When pursuing the proclamation of the sacred Dharma, one will perceive the reality of the consequences of karmic actions and thus disengage from unvirtuous actions, such as killing. Instead, one will continuously abide by, familiarize oneself with, and increase acts that are virtuous. As the result of such actions, one will then be born as a god or human who has a long lifespan. The reason for such a birth is that one previously abided by, familiarized oneself with, and increased actions pertaining to the sacred Dharma. Therefore, this is a further quality that ensues from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma: the cultivation of activity that increases one’s lifespan. The qualities associated with the proclamation of the sacred Dharma possess causal powers such that upon hearing the Dharma, one becomes born among gods and humans. One takes birth as a human, or otherwise, in the case of a divine birth, one will be born as a long-living god. One will become a god endowed with a distinctive complexion, physique, glow, and playful activity. If, due to the proclamation of the sacred Dharma, one is born as a human, one will be born into a great family, enjoy a fine physique and perfect circumstances, and be endowed with excellent qualities and a long life. The land of one’s birth will also be excellent, and one will possess the authentic view.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4885,id:UT22084-068-021-7846}}}“ ‘Attending to, cultivating, and increasing the proclamation of the sacred Dharma also brings another aspect of deliverance from suffering, because when one walks with a faithful mind toward the proclamation of the sacred Dharma, one will thereby achieve the merit of Brahmā. Whenever one respects the proclamation of the sacred Dharma and acts accordingly, one will engage in wholesome physical conduct. When one’s mind has heard the teaching, one will engage in wholesome verbal conduct. When one hears the teaching and develops strong faith, the mind will engage in wholesome mental conduct. {{page:{number:1903,id:UT22084-068-021-101932,folio:F.99.a,volume:V71}}} Therefore, endowed with this threefold positive conduct that is rooted in the proclamation of the Dharma, one will be born among gods and humans, experiencing perfect happiness. One will also enjoy a long life, and one will completely transcend suffering. All good qualities are achieved from the proclamation of the Dharma, not from anything else. Therefore, the highest fortune is achieved through the proclamation of the Dharma.

{{milestone:{label:4.C.4886,id:UT22084-068-021-7848}}}“ ‘There is yet another quality that ensues from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma. What is that? Being praised by the people of the world. All good things are achieved through the proclamation of the Dharma: discipline, qualities, learning, training, vast intelligence, and everyone’s praises. Homage, pleasant words, honesty, and sincerity—all of this ensues from the proclamation of the Dharma. People with these qualities are apprehensive of even the most subtle unvirtuous factors, and everyone will therefore become their friends. Such people are praised by everyone. In fearful circumstances and when suffering arises, they will receive everyone’s help. In this way, those who proclaim the sacred Dharma will be praised by the people of the world.

{{milestone:{label:4.C.4887,id:UT22084-068-021-7850}}}“ ‘There is yet another quality that ensues from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma. What is that? Being protected by the gods.

Protected by the gods, those in possession of such qualities will develop good qualities assisted by great gatherings of people. {{page:{number:1904,id:UT22084-068-021-101933,folio:F.99.b,volume:V71}}} The obstacles that may otherwise be inflicted by great gatherings of people will wane, and such people cannot be caught or apprehended by the forces of the māras. The forces of the sacred Dharma are then very visible. Seeing the presence of such causes, the gods will offer their protection and assist such people day and night, following them wherever they go. Whatever projects such people initiate will turn out excellently, and the gods will develop faith in them because of their positive actions. Due to such mutual causal relationships, any success that they achieve will give further rise to exceptionally great virtues in the future. All their positive acts will lead to great success, and the more successful they become, the more their virtuous activities will expand. In this way, going from one joy to the next, they accomplish goodness in both this world and the next. Such are the qualities that grow from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma, which is like a supporting ground. Therefore, the supreme treasure of all fortune is this: the proclamation of the Dharma.
(24) Having Excellent Intentions

People who in this way are endowed with the Dharma and adhere to the Dharma—possessing knowledge, discipline, and generosity—will have excellent intentions throughout their present life. Any project of theirs that has not yet been completed, or that has been unsuccessful, they will accomplish with diligence. They do not become afflicted but are endowed with the Dharma. They relinquish the five terrors of being attached to possessions, and they live uniquely by maintaining a proper livelihood. {{page:{number:1905,id:UT22084-068-021-101934,folio:F.100.a,volume:V71}}} When their bodies disintegrate, they die and are then born in the higher realms of the gods.

Possessing the wealth of being endowed with the Dharma. People will follow the disciplined teachers who are endowed with such qualities of proclaiming the Dharma. They will be generous in equal measure to all such beings who observe discipline. When they are in the presence of religious beings, they will give generously to such people of the Dharma, but not because they are forced to do so or out of embarrassment. This causes them to have continuous flourishing. It leads to welfare and happiness, both in this life and the next. That is another quality that stems from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma.
(26) Being Free From Laziness
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4890,id:UT22084-068-021-7856}}}“ ‘There is yet another quality that ensues from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma. What is that? Being free from laziness. When wise people listen to the proclamation of the Dharma, they hear about the flaws of laziness, how laziness prevents success both in this life and beyond. All such failure is due to laziness. Upon hearing about its flaws, they will give up laziness. Endeavoring diligently with mindfulness and introspection, they become free from all forms of laziness. As they become expedient, timely, and free from negativity and neglect, they will accomplish all aims perfectly. Such people who do what is beneficial in this world and beyond, who are free from laziness, and who are disciplined and diligent, will perfect all aims. They will follow through in all their pursuits. In the unlikely event that laziness should enter their hearts, the proclamation of the Dharma will make them recall the flaws of laziness. {{page:{number:1906,id:UT22084-068-021-101935,folio:F.100.b,volume:V71}}} As they constantly uphold excellent qualities and resent all flaws, they will give up laziness. They will abandon it as if it were a weapon. Also, if any achievement should deteriorate, then that is a flaw of laziness. Freedom from laziness accomplishes any and all objectives related to study. That is another quality that stems from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma.
(27) Gratitude

As one hears the different teachings, one will become grateful and understand reality. Hearing about the qualities of gratitude, one will always be grateful to those who proclaim the Dharma. Those who are grateful and appreciative will have extremely steadfast friends. Even people who have not previously declared their friendship will become your friends. You will be acknowledged as a person with good qualities and will recall even trifling help you have received. Endowed with gratitude, you thereby attain all great qualities and achieve omniscience.
(28) Continuous Recollection of Death
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4892,id:UT22084-068-021-7860}}}“ ‘There is yet another quality that ensues from the proclamation of the sacred Dharma. What is that? Constant recollection of death. Among all forms of mindfulness, mindfulness of death is supreme. Contemplating death is overpowering and instills fear in all beings. Frightened, they will then not engage in inappropriate actions. When their eyes see forms, they will not develop attachments or entertain thoughts about what they see. When their ears hear sounds, they will not develop attachments or entertain thoughts about what they hear. When their tongues perceive tastes, they will not develop attachments or entertain thoughts about what they taste. {{page:{number:1907,id:UT22084-068-021-101936,folio:F.101.a,volume:V71}}} When their bodies feel textures, they will not develop attachments or entertain thoughts about what they touch.

{{milestone:{label:4.C.4893,id:UT22084-068-021-7861}}}“ ‘The fear of those who are afraid of death makes all those things appear pointless. All those things are seen as painful. All those things are seen as empty of self. All those things are seen as empty. As they see things correctly, they become detached. Hence, they have no attachment to the world of gods. Nor do they have any attachment to the world of humans. And why should they have any attachment to the realms of hell beings, starving spirits, or animals? Therefore, they are liberated from attachment to the five realms. They have left it all behind. They are terrified by it all and distraught by the sufferings of death and rebirth. Free from desire, they are liberated. And from their liberation emerges the wakefulness of liberation. They now think, “I have accomplished what was needed in terms of pure conduct. I do not perceive any further existences of mine. I have achieved these qualities having practiced pure conduct, just as they were taught. All this is due to nothing but listening to the sacred Dharma and following spiritual teachers.” Therefore, at all times and with all manner of diligent effort, everyone should listen to the proclamation of the sacred Dharma. Within cyclic existence, that which is beneficial both in this world and the next is adherence to those who proclaim the sacred Dharma and spiritual teachers. Those are the two factors that bring fortune both here and beyond.

Upon hearing the proclamation of the Dharma, all holy people cultivate the recollection of death in accordance with what they have heard. The flaws that cause sentient beings to take birth must be given up, and the three stains of desire, anger, and ignorance are those causes of cyclic existence. Once those have been eliminated, there is no future birth. Nothing will die. There is no more death.

Those who have practiced wholesome activities will not have any regrets at the time of death. Those who have heard the meaning of the proclaimed Dharma will actualize the path at the time of death. What they at that point see directly will make them have even stronger faith and devotion for the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha. As their minds brighten, their blood will be purified, and when their blood is purified, their countenance also brightens. When their mind is bright, their physical form will also appear resplendent.

If they have performed actions that propel one to birth in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, their conviction can make them take birth in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three instead. If they have performed actions that cause birth in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, they may be born in the Heaven Free from Strife. Likewise, if they have done actions that cause birth in the Heaven of Joy, they may be born among the gods in the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations. In this way, they may take birth all the way to the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations. Corresponding to their impelling mental factors and their levels of faith, they attain such auspicious abodes. All of that is due to hearing; it does not occur without it. Such hearing, moreover, is that of the proclamation of the Dharma, not anything else.

Once that happens, their flawed actions will cause them to take birth among hell beings, starving spirits, and animals. {{page:{number:1913,id:UT22084-068-021-101942,folio:F.104.a,volume:V71}}} Should they instead be born as humans due to karmic actions to be experienced in other lives, they will enjoy perfect circumstances and be destined to perfect happiness and joy. They will have a constant wish to hear the Dharma and become supreme followers of the Dharma. They will be mentally capable and possess the authentic view, becoming kings or royal ministers in causal accord with their actions.”

The Gods in Shining in Manifold Ways
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4931,id:UT22084-068-021-7907}}}“As the monk who has knowledge of the effects of the ripening of karmic actions continues to explore the realms of the gods of the Heaven Free from Strife, he will with insight derived from hearing correctly perceive a realm of the Heaven Free from Strife known as Shining in Manifold Ways. Wondering what karmic actions cause beings to take birth in that realm, he correctly notices how certain holy people who engage in virtue practice positive actions of body, speech, and mind. They are endowed with discipline and are impossible to lead astray. Endowed with the authentic view and a correct livelihood, they conduct themselves in a perfectly stainless way throughout their environment and are honest and sincere. With affectionate concern for sentient beings, they have given up killing and stealing. As for sexual misconduct, they will not even become smitten with women in their dreams, and they will not accompany them. Likewise, during the day, they do not give rise to any foul thoughts about anybody. They think, ‘Having given up sexual misconduct, {{page:{number:1914,id:UT22084-068-021-101943,folio:F.104.b,volume:V71}}} I shall attain a perfectly pure effect. Because I have given up sexual misconduct, I will become a god, and in the heavens I will be surrounded by divine ladies. I shall enjoy myself with those perfect goddesses, not with any human woman.’
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4932,id:UT22084-068-021-7908}}}“Since they are interested only in goddesses, they practice a stained form of pure conduct. They consider how at present they are unable to act like the gods, and acknowledge how they have hitherto failed to give up sexual misconduct. They understand that their previous joking, posing, and frolicking together with women were not wholesome acts and that such acts will not bring birth in an excellent realm. Accordingly, they now refrain from relishing their previous joking, posing, and frolicking together with women. They no longer think of such things, and should any desirous motivations arise in their minds, they will diligently put an end to them. In this manner, they persevere whenever reminiscences of any former joking, posing, and enjoyment crop up. They do not entertain any thoughts about their former female companions, and even if such thoughts should occur, they endeavor decisively to end them. When the bodies of such holy people disintegrate, they will, after their death, go to the joyous higher realms and be born among the gods in Shining in Manifold Ways within the Heaven Free from Strife.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4933,id:UT22084-068-021-7909}}} “Once born there, they will experience the consequences of their wholesome practice of positive actions as their past virtuous actions produce a resultant ripening. {{page:{number:1915,id:UT22084-068-021-101944,folio:F.105.a,volume:V71}}} Perfectly endowed with the pleasures of the five senses, they will now appear as gods in a heavenly realm that is illumined by the colorful light of manifold jewels. Due to the gods’ former positive actions, such unprecedented jewels appear, and thus they behold an environment that is made of numerous vajra stones, dazzling mountain peaks, and cascades of beryl, sapphire, great sapphire, crystal, musāragalva, ruby, and emerald. In accordance with the special features of the divine substances caused by the gods’ karmic actions, hundreds of thousands of jewels cast a bright light throughout the land.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4934,id:UT22084-068-021-7910}}} “This bright and colorful light is what is registered first by the visual consciousness of the newly born gods, and this unprecedented sight is tremendously enticing to their visual consciousness. Next, they will begin to hear songs, drums, and musical instruments that resonate with divine tones, and next will come the olfactory experiences of an array of unparalleled divine fragrances. To a newly born god, these three experiences provide an initial distraction, and thus they start off their indulgence in their realm of distraction on the basis of these unprecedented sights and incomparable experiences.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4935,id:UT22084-068-021-7911}}} “Once they have taken in the initial sights, these gods who are endowed with the fortunes of the pinnacle of wholesome karmic activity will begin to explore the forests. They will then arrive at a forest called Illumination, which shines an unparalleled bright light throughout the environment. The gods living in the forest rush forth to meet any newcomer. {{page:{number:1916,id:UT22084-068-021-101945,folio:F.105.b,volume:V71}}} The gods wear many different costumes and appear in many different guises. They sing a variety of songs and play drums and beautiful music, thus producing melodies and tunes of indescribable beauty. When a newly born gods sees these divine beings, he will be consumed by desire—to which he has been accustomed since time without beginning—and thus he will happily go to mingle among them.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4936,id:UT22084-068-021-7912}}}“The gods of the forest likewise will come to welcome the newcomer. Some will ascend high into the sky where they play vīṇās and sing. Others will stand on the rooftops of their mansions, gazing with impassioned eyes as they take in the unique fragrances of bouquets of flowers. Still other gods will gather on the ground, forming welcoming processions as they play a variety of instruments and carry flowers in their hands. Some will run forth to the young god with flowers in their hands. Others will rush forth with colorful wines that possess perfect flavors and fragrances and are free from any flaws of intoxication. When they come to the newcomer, they will offer him the wine, and as he greets them, he will then drink of these heavenly drinks, which have exquisite colors and flavors. As he partakes of the drinks, his heavenly exuberance will increase tenfold in intensity.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4937,id:UT22084-068-021-7913}}}“The newcomer will also be distracted by a fourth type of object, and thus, while he was previously distracted by forms, sounds, and scents, he will thereafter also be distracted by flavors. His body will also find gratification, sensing rich and diverse textures of the most perfectly pleasing types. As for his state of mind, {{page:{number:1917,id:UT22084-068-021-101946,folio:F.106.a,volume:V71}}} all that he may wish for will be effortlessly achieved without any hardship whatsoever. In this way the newly born god discerns by means of the six collections of consciousness engaged in craving.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4938,id:UT22084-068-021-7914}}} “Enjoying these perfect endowments of the five sense pleasures together with the other gods, the newly born god will at some point enter the forest known as In Tune with All Pleasures. There he will see how the congregations of gods in the forest frolic and enjoy numerous games. Some play around in lotus ponds, others enter vine-clad mansions to play, some go to the summits of the mountains where they frolic to the accompaniment of music from the five types of instruments, and still other gods enjoy themselves by means of the six collections of consciousness engaged in craving. Together with the other gods, the newly born god will then go to visit still other gods with their coteries of goddesses. In their cabins, they float through the sky to celebrate, their bodies adorned with numerous different jewels. Meanwhile, other gods descend onto the branches of the trees, where they dance and frolic with the goddesses, accompanied by music from the five types of instruments.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4939,id:UT22084-068-021-7915}}}“Seeing all this, the newly born god becomes ecstatic, and thus he will mingle with all the other parties of gods. As the various groups of gods mingle and accompany each other, the newly born god will enter the forest. Joyfully roaming about to the accompaniment of music from the five types of instruments, everyone will revel for a long while amid the pleasures of the five senses, {{page:{number:1918,id:UT22084-068-021-101947,folio:F.106.b,volume:V71}}} partaking of them in accordance with their individual karmic actions.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4940,id:UT22084-068-021-7916}}}“When in this way they have journeyed through the forest for an extremely long time, they will at some point go to play at a mountain made of seven precious substances known as Adorned with Numerous Cascades. Enamored with each other’s company, they will enjoy the effects of their own actions as they have fun among the cascades that gush forth between the trees, the many gorgeous jewel rocks, and the waterfalls with bright, perfectly cooling, and utterly pristine waters.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4941,id:UT22084-068-021-7917}}}“Seeing how the gods live carelessly, birds known as waterfall roamers, who play with the gods, will warble the following verses to them:

Of your own karmic actions,

You do not see the terror ahead of you.

Although the verses were spoken for their benefit, the gods still do not understand this. Ravaged by objects, they instead will continue dancing, laughing, and playing as they move on through the forest of Illumination with its numerous vine-draped trees.

Numerous delightful lotus pools, bathing ponds, and waterfalls are home to a wide variety of flocks of birds that sing hundreds of tunes. The twigs of the trees, which bow down under the weight of hundreds of thousands of blooming mandārava flowers, are teeming with hundreds of gods. To the tunes of heavenly music from the five types of instruments, the gods will carouse and enjoy themselves with the newcomers. Those who have already lived a long time will continuously introduce the newly born gods to ever-new aspects and features of the forests, thus showing them all the embankments, lotus pools, expansive landscapes, vine-draped mansions, jungles, wish-fulfilling trees, and lush forests that are ablaze with the radiant light of the seven precious substances and abound with a variety of cabins. {{page:{number:1920,id:UT22084-068-021-101949,folio:F.107.b,volume:V71}}}

With his mind in a frenzy of wonder and amazement, he finds himself surrounded by gods and is thus consumed by the fire of lustful craving and enveloped in the smoke of carelessness. Burned again and again, he remains amid the divine gathering. Yet, burned by his powerful craving for the objects within the great forest, he will keep pressing onward.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4955,id:UT22084-068-021-7931}}}“When a long time has passed in this way, the gods will at some point arrive at a lotus pond known as Colorful Brightness. This pond is of unparalleled beauty. For example, some of the flowers that grow there have petals of beryl and stalks of gold. Their cores of ruby and fine gold support silvery anthers that are frequented by sapphire-colored bees. Other flowers have stems of silver and sapphire petals, and their golden anthers attract gorgeous bees in the colors of musāragalva, crystal, and gold. Still other flowers have golden stalks and sapphire petals, and their cores of pure silver are adorned by ruby-colored bees. In other flowers the stems, petals, anthers, and cores are all red, and so are the bees that adorn them. There are also flowers that have stems, petals, anthers, and cores in the color of silver, and those flowers likewise attract gorgeous bees of the same color. {{page:{number:1921,id:UT22084-068-021-101950,folio:F.108.a,volume:V71}}} In other flowers, the stems, petals, anthers, and cores are all blue and attract swarms of humming bees.

These highly diverse flowers also carry many different scents and all have lovely petals that are blue, yellow, white, red, black, or multicolored. Around them hover gorgeous bees. Such are the ravishing features of this wealth of bright lotus flowers. The pristine, cool, sweet water in that colorful pond is of a most delightful kind, and the stunning flowers made of enchanting heavenly substances are of perfect color, fragrance, and shape. Together with his attending goddesses, the newly born god will go to celebrate and have fun there, enjoying the sense pleasures to the accompaniment of music from the five types of instruments.

These birds fill the environment with their delightful songs.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4958,id:UT22084-068-021-7934}}}“Due to the splendor of the gods’ former positive actions, there are some trees among the woods growing on the banks of the lotus pond with cabins in them. When the gods who play by the lake climb these trees, they may think, ‘How nice if there were some cabins for us here.’ Due to the gods’ former positive actions, as soon as they form that wish, those cabin-trees, lush with flowers that satisfy swarms of humming bees, produce cabins that shine with the light of the seven precious substances and are designed with perfect features of flowing streams, ponds, parks, and ornaments made of the seven precious substances. Wearing their various ornaments and garments, the gods and their retinues of goddesses will enter the cabins to play, joke, and sing. While the gods reside within them, the cabins may also ascend into the sky so that the gods in the Heaven Free from Strife can travel as they please to see other areas. Such are the powerful qualities of the cabin-trees that grow among the trees on the banks of the lotus pond.

As the branches touch, they produce a great symphony of delightful tones, and at the same time a gentle rain of heavenly jewels will fall like flowers. At that time, the entire sky is illuminated by the light of the jewels, just as when the sun and moon shine on Jambudvīpa. In this way, all of the sky is illumined.
{{milestone:{label:4.C.4960,id:UT22084-068-021-7936}}}“There is also a tree known as unmoving creature that grows on the banks of the lotus pond. While the gods play by the pond, their former positive actions will make these trees produce a white sap endowed with divine fragrance, taste, color, and texture. When the gods drink of the sap, it increases their ecstasy tenfold, yet it is free from any flaws of intoxication. Together with their companions, the gods will then dance and celebrate. They will also partake of nectar foods, and the trees will transform in accordance with the gods’ karmic actions.

The power of this tree is such that all sorts of birds come there. When the gods who visit the pond have spent much time playing there, celebrating to music from the five types of instruments, they will proceed to climb those trees. Then, wishing to see delightful sights, they will sit on the backs of the birds and take off into the sky. The birds will then carry the gods to any place they may think of. The birds can also transform into gorgeous flying cabins that the gods can reside in as they tour the waterfalls, ponds, forests, and vine-clad mansions of their divine realm. There are also other birds there that will sing these verses:

For people whose discipline is flawed, though, even a long life is imperfect.

Or because they die, but because they will live in hell.
