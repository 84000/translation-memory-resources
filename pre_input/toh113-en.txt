{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-177}} At that time, the Bhagavān, surrounded by the fourfold assembly, was esteemed, honored, revered, respected, offered to, praised, and venerated. He had taught the Dharma teaching of the great extensive sūtra called The Great Elucidation , which is an instruction for bodhisattvas that is possessed by all the buddhas.
Sitting cross-legged on that Dharma seat, he entered the samādhi named the state of infinite instruction ; his body became motionless and his mind became motionless.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-179}} As soon as the Bhagavān entered that state there fell a rain of coral tree flowers, great coral tree flowers, and spider lily and great spider lily flowers, {{note:{index:64,id:UT22084-051-001-180}}} that fell upon the Bhagavān and his fourfold assembly. The whole buddha realm shook in six ways: it moved, moved strongly, quaked, quaked strongly, shuddered, and shuddered strongly. Then at that time the bhikṣus and bhikṣunīs, the upāsakas and upāsikās, the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and nonhumans, kings of regions, bala­cakra­vartins, and cakravartins of the four continents, together with their retinues who were gathered in that assembly, {{page:{number:6,folio:F.4.a}}} were all gazing upon the Bhagavān with wonder, amazement, and joy.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-181}} Then at that time, a light ray shone from the ūrṇā hair between the Bhagavān’s eyebrows into eighteen thousand buddha realms in the eastern direction. The light of that light ray pervaded all those buddha realms from the great Avīci hell up to the apex of existence. It illuminated all beings without exception in the six classes of existence in those buddha realms. It also illuminated the buddha bhagavāns who resided, lived, and remained in those buddha realms. The Dharma that those buddha bhagavāns taught was heard by all without exception.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-182}} It illuminated in those buddha realms all the bhikṣus, bhikṣunīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, yogins, and yogācāras, both those who had attained the result and those who had not attained the result.
It illuminated in those buddha realms the bodhisattvas and mahāsattvas who practiced bodhisattva conduct through being skilled in methods, due to the many various ways of listening to the teachings, having objectives, and having aspirations.
It illuminated in those buddha realms the stūpas made of precious materials that contained the relics of the buddha bhagavāns who had passed into nirvāṇa.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-184}} Then bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya thought, “Oh! The Tathāgata has shown this great miraculous sign. Why did the Bhagavān show this kind of great miraculous sign? The Bhagavān, while resting in this samādhi, {{page:{number:7,folio:F.4.b}}} has revealed these kinds of inconceivable, marvelous, amazing, great miracles. Who can answer my question as to what this means? This Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta has served previous jinas, has planted the roots of merit, and has attended many buddhas. This Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta has also previously seen this kind of sign from past tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas, and he has previously heard numerous accounts of the great Dharma. I should ask Mañjuśrī.”
The bhikṣus and bhikṣunīs, the upāsakas and upāsikās, and the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans saw this light that was the great miraculous sign of the Bhagavān and were amazed, astonished, and intrigued.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-187}} They thought, “Whom shall we ask about this great miraculous sign revealed by the Bhagavān?”
Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya instantaneously knew the thoughts in the minds of the fourfold assembly, and inquired of Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, what was the cause and what the reason for the Bhagavān manifesting this wonderful illumination through a marvelous, astonishing, miraculous light that revealed these eighteen thousand beautiful, supremely beautiful buddha realms, among which are the tathāgatas and also the followers of the tathāgatas?”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-190}} The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya then spoke these verses to Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta: {{page:{number:8,folio:F.5.a}}}
“Mañjuśrī, for what reason Did this guide of men emit this single ray of light, This greatly illuminating light From the ūrṇā hair between his eyebrows? {1}

Why is that? The Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha has revealed a miraculous omen of this kind, this illumination from a ray of light, because he intends to teach the Dharma that is not in accord with the entire world.

{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-391}} Brother Śāriputra, knowing that the fourfold retinue was uncertain and in doubt, at that time said these words to the Bhagavān: “Bhagavān, what is the cause and what is the reason why the Bhagavān has in this way repeatedly praised the teaching of the Dharma of being wise in skill in methods, and repeatedly said, ‘I have realized this profound Dharma’ and ‘It is difficult to know the intended meaning of the teaching’?

Śāriputra, if I were to teach the meaning of this, {{page:{number:29,folio:F.15.b}}} it would alarm this world with its devas.”
Then Brother Śāriputra for a second time made his request to the Bhagavān, saying, “Bhagavān, I request that you teach this meaning. I request that the Sugata teach it. Why is that? Bhagavān, in this assembly there are many hundreds of beings, many thousands of beings, many hundred thousands of beings, many hundred thousand quintillions of beings, who have seen past buddhas and are endowed with wisdom, and they will have faith in the teaching of the Bhagavān, will have conviction in it, and will uphold it.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-3692}} Then at that time Brother Śāriputra recited this verse:
“There are thousands of beings in this assembly Who have faith in, delight in, and venerate the Sugata, And they will understand the Dharma that you teach. Therefore, king and lord of humans, {{note:{index:106,id:UT22084-051-001-409}}} I request that you clearly teach.” {33}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-410}} Then the Bhagavān said a second time to Brother Śāriputra. “Śāriputra, {{note:{index:107,id:UT22084-051-001-411}}} if I were to teach the meaning of this it would alarm this world with its devas, and it would cause bhikṣus who have great pride to fall into a great abyss.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-412}} Thereupon the Bhagavān spoke this verse:
“I have taught enough of this Dharma. This wisdom is subtle and cannot be analyzed. There are many present who are foolish and proud. They will not understand and will reject my teaching.” {34}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-414}} Then Brother Śāriputra made a third request to the Bhagavān, saying, “I request that the Bhagavān teach. I request that the Sugata teach.

Bhagavān, there are many hundreds of such beings, many thousands of such beings, many hundred thousands of such beings, many hundred thousand quintillions of such beings, and there are others who were ripened by the Bhagavān in their previous existences. {{page:{number:30,folio:F.16.a}}} They will have faith in, have conviction in, and will uphold the Bhagavān’s teaching, and for a long time it will bring them benefit, welfare, and happiness.”

Therefore, Śāriputra, listen carefully and remember, for I will give you the teaching.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-420}} As soon as the Bhagavān had consented, more than five thousand arrogant bhikṣus, bhikṣunīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās within that assembly rose from their seats, bowed down their heads to the Bhagavān’s feet, and departed from the assembly. As a result of their arrogance they believed that they had obtained roots of merit when they had not obtained them, and believed they had realization when they did not have realization. They had become aware of their own error and departed from that assembly, the Bhagavān giving his permission to do so by remaining silent.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-421}} Then the Bhagavān said to Brother Śāriputra, “Śāriputra, my assembly has become free of its dregs. {{page:{number:31,folio:F.16.b}}} Śāriputra, it has become free of those who were worthless, while those for whom faith is essential remain. It is good that those who are arrogant have departed. Therefore, Śāriputra, I shall teach that meaning.”

The Bhagavān said to Brother Śāriputra, “Śāriputra, knowing the different aspirations and different thoughts and natures of beings, a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha teaches the Dharma through various accomplishments, causes, reasons, parables, supports, definitions, and skillful methods in this way.

“As a parable, Śāriputra, in a village, a town, a market town, a district, a region, a country, or a capital, there was a householder who was old, an elder, advanced in years, aged, and was rich, wealthy, and had many possessions. His home was tall and extensive . It had been built a long time ago and had deteriorated. A hundred, two hundred, three, four, or five hundred people lived in it. It had only one entranceway. It was roofed with hay. Its terrace was crumbling. {{page:{number:57,folio:F.29.b}}} The bases of its pillars were rotten. The walls and doors were disintegrating. A great fire started suddenly throughout the house from all sides. The man had many sons—five, ten, or twenty—and the man came out from the house. Śāriputra, the man then saw the great fire burning everywhere throughout his house. He was frightened and dismayed. He thought, ‘I have not been touched, I have not been burned by this great fire. I was able to quickly escape from the burning house through the door. But my sons, who are young, who are children, are engaged in enjoying themselves playing games inside the burning house. They are not aware that the house is burning, they have not understood it, do not know it, have not realized it, and so they will be burned in this great fire, and will experience great suffering. But they are not dismayed at the thought of being touched by that great fire, they do not think of that suffering, and do not think of escaping from the house.’
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-706}} “Śāriputra, the man was very strong and had very strong arms. He thought, ‘I am strong and I have strong arms. I shall gather all the children together and carry them on my hips out from the house.’ Then he thought, ‘The house has only one door and that door is narrow. These young ones don’t stay still, are always running around, so I won’t be able to bring them out, and there will be the disaster of their agony in the great fire. So I should call out to them.’
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-707}} “Then he called out to the children, ‘There is a massive fire burning the house! Everything inside is going to be burned in this great fire! You will suffer disastrously! Children, come here! Come out!’
“The man gave that command wishing to help them, but the children, not knowing what ‘burning’ meant were not dismayed, not frightened, and not terrified. {{page:{number:58,folio:F.30.a}}} They did not think about it and did not come out, but ran and scampered around here and there, repeatedly looking out at their father. Why was that? They were like that because they were children.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-709}} “Then the man thought, ‘A great fire is burning this house. My children and I are going to be afflicted disastrously by this great fire. But if I use a skillful method I will be able to bring the children out of the house.’
“The man knew what his children thought. He understood that they would wish for many different kinds of amusements, and many different kinds of things: a variety of delightful, desirable, pleasing, beautiful, and charming and pleasant things, which would be difficult to find.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-711}} “Then the man, knowing their thoughts, called to the children, ‘Those toys that you delight in and marvel at, and that you are unhappy not to have obtained, which have many different colors and shapes, such as an ox-drawn cart, a goat-drawn cart, and a deer-drawn cart, which you think are delightful, desirable, pleasing, beautiful, charming, and pleasant, those I have placed outside at the entrance door of the house outside so that you can play with them. So come, run outside, and I will give each of you whatever you want. So come quickly for that reason!’
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-712}} “Those children, hearing that and the names of those things that they wished for, that they longed for, which they thought delightful, desirable, pleasing, beautiful, charming, and pleasant, in order to play with those things, quickly and zealously ran out from the burning house with great speed, calling out to each other, ‘Who will be first? Who will be first of all?’ And as one body they quickly came running out of the burning house.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-713}} “Then the man saw that they had come out safe and well, and were no longer in danger. Then they came to the village square, in the open air.

They had seats. They had strings of small bells attached. They were high and stable. They were adorned with marvelous, amazing jewels. They were beautified by strings of jewels. They were decorated with flower garlands. They had cotton-filled cushions covered with calico and silk, and red backrests on both sides. Yoked to them were dazzling white oxen that were swift and that were held by many men. They had banners. He gave to each of his children an ox-drawn cart that was as fast as the wind.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-717}} “Śāriputra, what was the reason for that? The man was rich, wealthy, and had many treasuries. He thought, ‘There is no reason why I should give inferior {{note:{index:188,id:UT22084-051-001-718}}} carts to my children. Why is that? All these children are my sons. All of them are dear and precious to me. If I have such great carts, I should treat them all equally, and not unequally. I have many treasuries, so not to speak of my own sons alone, I should give all beings this kind of great cart.’ Then at that time those children, astonished and amazed, climbed onto those great carts.
“Śāriputra, what do you think? In that way, the man first promised three carts to those children, but afterward gave them all such great carts, {{note:{index:189,id:UT22084-051-001-720}}} magnificent carts. Does that mean that the man would be a liar?” {{page:{number:60,folio:F.31.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-721}} “No, Bhagavān, he would not be,” answered Śāriputra. “Sugata, it is not like that. The man through employing that skillful method brought those children out from the burning house in order to save their lives. That would not be a reason for his being a liar. Why is that? Bhagavān, it was only through saving their own bodies that they could obtain all those toys, and, Bhagavān, the man did not give just one cart to his children. Therefore, Bhagavān, the man was not a liar. Why is that? Bhagavān, first the man thought, ‘Using a skillful method I shall save the children from immense suffering.’ Because of that approach, the man would not be a liar. That man had many treasuries and he thought of his children with affection, and wished to delight them. Not to speak of just giving them a great cart, he gave each one a cart with the same colors. Therefore, Bhagavān, the man would not be a liar.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-722}} When he had said that, the Bhagavān commended Śāriputra, “Excellent, excellent, Śāriputra! It is so, Śāriputra! It is exactly as you have said! In that same way a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha saves from all dangers, all violence, troubles, harm, suffering, unhappiness, the darkness of ignorance, the obscuration of the dark of blindness, and being in bondage.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-723}} “A tathāgata has wisdom, strengths, fearlessnesses, and the unique qualities of a buddha. He has great power through miraculous powers . He is a father to the world.

I shall give to these beings the inconceivable, incalculable bliss of the wisdom of buddhahood, which they will delight in, enjoy, take pleasure in, and amuse themselves with. {{page:{number:62,folio:F.32.a}}}
“This, Śāriputra, is how a tathāgata sees: it is said I have the strength of wisdom, the strength of miraculous powers , but if I had no method and instructed these beings to attain a tathāgata’s wisdom, strengths, and fearlessnesses, those beings would not become liberated through those dharmas. Why is that? Those beings are attached to the five sensory pleasures, and delight in the three realms. They would not become liberated from birth, aging, illness, death, misery, wailing, suffering, unhappiness, and disturbance. They would not escape from the three realms, which are like a house with a dilapidated roof and rafters that are on fire, and in which they will be burned, roasted, pained, and tormented.

He guides beings through the three yānas, which are the Śrāvakayāna, the Pratyeka­buddha­yāna, and the Bodhisattva­yāna.

This is how one escapes from the three realms: obtain the three yānas—the Śrāvakayāna, Pratyeka­buddha­yāna, and Bodhisattva­yāna. This I promise you. I shall give you these three yānas. Dedicate yourself to them in order to escape from the three realms. Beings! These yānas are those of the āryas, they are praised by the āryas, and they bring great joy. Perfectly amuse yourself with them, enjoy them, and delight in them. Experience great joy through the powers, the strengths, the aspects of enlightenment, the dhyānas, the liberations, the samādhis, and the samāpattis. You will become possessed of perfect happiness of mind.

The Bhagavān said to Brother Mahākāśyapa, “Kāśyapa, it is like this: A potter makes all bowls from clay equally.

There is no one who sees forms with good color or bad color. There are no sun and moon. There are no stars. There are no planets. There is no one who sees planets.’
“Then some other people say in front of that born-blind man, ‘There are good colors and bad colors. There are those who see forms with good color or bad color. There are a sun and moon. There are stars. There are planets. There are those who see planets.’
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1105}} “The born-blind man does not have faith in those people, and does not believe what they have said.
“A physician who knows every illness sees the blind man and thinks, ‘That man has an illness because of his past bad karma. Every illness is one of four {{note:{index:261,id:UT22084-051-001-1107}}} kinds: caused by air, caused by bile, caused by phlegm, or caused by their combination.’ {{page:{number:101,folio:F.51.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1108}} “Then the physician thinks again and again as to what method would cure the man of his illness. He thinks, ‘The medicines that are available here will not be able to cure him, but there are four kinds of herbs on the king of mountains, the Himalayas.’ What are these four? First there is the one named endowed with all colors and tastes, {{note:{index:262,id:UT22084-051-001-1109}}} the second is called freedom from all illness, {{note:{index:263,id:UT22084-051-001-1110}}} the third is called elimination of all poisons, {{note:{index:264,id:UT22084-051-001-1111}}} and the fourth is called bestowing happiness anywhere. {{note:{index:265,id:UT22084-051-001-1112}}} Those are the four herbs.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1113}} “Then the physician, feeling compassion for the born-blind man, contemplates by what method he would be able to go to the king of mountain ranges, the Himalayas. He goes there and, searching for them, he climbs up, climbs down, and traverses their slopes. Searching in that way he finds the four herbs. After finding them, some he gives after grinding them with his teeth, some he gives after crushing them, some he gives after mixing them with other substances and then cooking them, some he gives after mixing them with other substances uncooked, some he gives after piercing a point on the body with a needle, some he gives after burning them with fire, and some he gives after mixing them with each other, and also mixing them with food, drink, and so on. Through the application of these methods the born-blind man gains sight.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1114}} “When he has gained sight he sees outside and inside, far and near, the light of the moon, the sunlight, the stars, the planets, and all forms. He says, ‘Oh, I was so stupid before in not believing what was taught to me, not accepting what was said. Now I can see everything! I am freed from blindness!’
“At that time there are rishis who have the five higher knowledges: divine sight, divine hearing, the knowledge of others’ minds, memory of previous lives, and mastery of miraculous powers . They say to the man, ‘Oh, all you obtained is your sight. If you have no other knowledge, why are you proud? You have no wisdom. {{page:{number:102,folio:F.52.a}}} You have no sagacity.’
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1116}} “They also say to him, ‘You know, when you are sitting inside a house, you do not see the forms that are outside. You do not know the kind thoughts or malicious thoughts of beings. You do not know, do not hear, the sounds of people speaking, or the sounds of drums, conches, and so on, which are five yojanas away. You are not able to travel one krośa without taking a step with your feet. You are not able to remember the activity of being conceived and growing in your mother’s womb. So how can you be sagacious? How can you say that you see everything? Oh, you think that light is darkness. You think that darkness is light!’
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1117}} “Then that man says to the rishis, ‘Through what method and through what good actions can I attain such wisdom as that, and through your benevolence attain these qualities?’
“ ‘If you wish for those you must dwell in a solitary place,’ say the rishis to that man, ‘or, staying in a cave, you should contemplate the Dharma. You should forsake all the afflictions of the mind. If in this way you have the qualities of a mendicant, you will attain higher knowledge.’
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1119}} “That man then adopts that goal and entering homelessness he resides in solitude. With a one-pointed mind he abandons craving for this world and attains the five higher knowledges. Having obtained the five higher knowledges, he thinks, ‘I did not attain any qualities whatsoever through the other actions I had performed in the past. Now I can go wherever I think of. In the past, I had little wisdom and little insight. I was blind.’
“Kāśyapa, I have made this parable so that its meaning can be understood. Its meaning should be seen in this way:
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1121}} “Kāśyapa, the blind man represents the beings who dwell in the saṃsāra of the five {{note:{index:266,id:UT22084-051-001-1122}}} kinds of existences. Those who do not know the good Dharma generate the black darkness of the kleśas and have the blindness of ignorance. Those who are blind with ignorance accumulate formations. {{page:{number:103,folio:F.52.b}}} Through the factor of formation there is name-and-form, and so on until the arising of a great mass of sheer suffering. In that way they are blinded by ignorance. The Tathāgata has compassion for the beings in saṃsāra, and although he has transcended the three realms he has love for them like that of a father for his only son. With great compassion he goes to the three realms. The Bhagavān looks with eyes of wisdom upon the beings who are afflicted and wandering in the cycle of saṃsāra and do not know how to leave saṃsāra. Seeing them he knows, ‘These beings, because of their previous good actions, have little anger and great desire, while these have little desire and great anger; some have little wisdom, some are wise; and some are ripened and pure, and some hold wrong views.’ The Tathāgata, using a skillful method, teaches three yānas to those beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1123}} “The rishis with the five higher knowledges and pure vision are the bodhisattvas who have developed the aspiration for enlightenment, attained receptivity to the birthlessness of phenomena, and attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.
“The great physician should be seen to be the Tathāgata.
“The born-blind man should be seen to be beings who are blinded by ignorance.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1126}} “Air, bile, and phlegm should be seen as desire, anger, ignorance, and the sixty-two fabricated views.
“The four kinds of herbs should be seen as (1) the doorway of emptiness, (2) the doorway of the absence of attributes, (3) the doorway of the absence of aspiration, and (4) nirvāṇa.
“The herbs are given in such and such a way so as to cure such and such an illness, and in that way through meditation on the doorways to liberation—emptiness, the absence of attributes, {{page:{number:104,folio:F.53.a}}} and the absence of aspiration—they bring an end to ignorance. Because of the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of formation, and so on until there is the cessation of the great mass of sheer suffering. And thus their minds neither dwell on virtue nor on sin.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1129}} “The born-blind man who gains sight should be seen as those who follow the Śrāvakayāna and the Pratyeka­buddha­yāna. They cut through the bondage of saṃsāra’s kleśas. Freed from the bondage of the kleśas, they are liberated from the six existences of the three realms. Therefore, those following the Śrāvakayāna think and say, ‘There is no other Dharma for attaining complete buddhahood and I have attained nirvāṇa.’ Then the Tathāgata teaches them the Dharma, saying, ‘How can one who has not attained the entire Dharma have nirvāṇa?’ and he then leads them to the attainment of enlightenment. Having gained realization they see the world of the three realms in the ten directions as empty, like an emanation, like an illusion, like a dream, a mirage, and an echo. They see that all phenomena are unborn and unceasing, without bondage or liberation, without darkness and without light.
“The ones who thus see and hear these profound dharmas see, without seeing, the different thoughts and aspirations of beings that fill the entire three realms.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1131}} Then the Bhagavān, teaching this in greater detail, recited these verses:

The Tathāgata is the one who knows our aspirations and our past.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1515}} He bowed down to the Bhagavān’s feet and then sat to one side and with his hands placed together in homage gazed unblinking upon the Bhagavān.
Then the Bhagavān, seeing the thoughts in the mind of Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇī­putra, said to the complete saṅgha of bhikṣus, “Bhikṣus, look upon my śrāvaka Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇī­putra. He is the best teacher among those who teach the Dharma within my {{note:{index:332,id:UT22084-051-001-1517}}} saṅgha of bhikṣus, and he is praised for having many true qualities. He is dedicated to holding the Dharma in many ways within my teaching. He tirelessly teaches the Dharma, bringing joy to the four assemblies, encouraging them, and inspiring them. He is able to teach the Dharma. He is able to aid those who maintain celibacy.
“Bhikṣus, other than the Tathāgata, there is no one who can match Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇī­putra in meaning or in words.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1518}} “Bhikṣus, what do you think? If you think that he has been a holder solely of my Dharma, bhikṣus, you should not regard him in that way. Why is that? Bhikṣus, I remember that in the past, in a time gone by, he was a holder of the Dharma of nine hundred and ninety million buddhas. Just as he is now the supreme teacher of my Dharma, {{page:{number:150,folio:F.76.a}}} so he was for all of them. For all of them he was someone who had realized emptiness. For all of them he was someone who had attained discernment. For all of them he was someone who had realized the higher knowledge of a bodhisattva. He was someone who taught the Dharma with complete certainty. He was someone who taught the Dharma free of doubt. He was someone who taught the Dharma in its purity. In the teaching of those buddha bhagavāns he practiced the conduct of celibacy throughout his life, and everywhere he was known as a śrāvaka. By this method, he benefited innumerable, countless hundred thousand quintillions of beings. He ripened innumerable, countless beings for the highest, complete enlightenment. At all times he has served beings through the activity of a buddha. At all times he has been purifying his own buddha realm, and has been dedicated to ripening beings.

“Bhikṣus, in the future in this fortunate eon, this Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇī­putra will be the principal teacher of the Dharma within the teachings of the thousand buddhas less four, and he will be a holder of their teaching. In the same way, in the future he will hold the entire Dharma of innumerable, countless buddha bhagavāns. He will benefit innumerable, countless beings.

With happiness and gladness they approached the Bhagavān, bowed their heads to his feet, and said to him, “Bhagavān, we confess this offence of ours: we have been always continuously thinking, ‘This is our nirvāṇa,’ or, ‘We have attained nirvāṇa.’ Bhagavān, we lacked understanding, lacked skill, and lacked knowledge. Why is that? We thought, ‘There is the attainment of buddhahood through the wisdom of the tathāgatas, but we are satisfied with a limited wisdom.’

Why did he sew it in?” Oh my friend, you are a fool that you have accepted to undergo such hardship in searching for food and clothing!

Bhikṣus, there are the roots of merit in your beings that I have ripened in the past.

Bhagavān, we are honored by the world with its devas, humans, and asuras as the sons of the Bhagavān, the attendants of the Bhagavān, and the keepers of the Dharma treasure of the Bhagavān. Therefore, Bhagavān, it would be fitting if the Bhagavān were quickly to give us the prophecy of our attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1595}} Moreover, more than two thousand bhikṣus, those in training and those passed beyond training, rose from their seats, removed their upper robe from one shoulder, and with hands together in homage stood facing the Bhagavān, gazing upon him and contemplating the wisdom of the Buddha, and thought, “May we also obtain the prophecy of our attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment!”

{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1725}} This concludes “The Dharmabhāṇakas,” the tenth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “ The White Lotus of the Good Dharma .”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1726}} Then a stūpa made of the seven precious materials arose from the center of the assembly, directly in front of the Bhagavān. It was five hundred yojanas tall and of a corresponding circumference. Having risen up, it remained suspended in the air, bright and beautiful, adorned with five thousand encircling railings {{note:{index:358,id:UT22084-051-001-1727}}} covered in flowers, and beautified by many thousands of toraṇas , hung with thousands of sacred flags and banners of victory, {{page:{number:176,folio:F.89.a}}} hung with thousands of strings of jewels, hung with thousands of streamers and bells, and emitting the aroma of bay leaves and sandalwood. That aroma spread throughout the entire all-containing world. Its crowning parasol reached as high as the palaces in the paradises of the Four Mahārājas. It was made of the seven precious materials, which are gold, silver, beryl, white coral, emerald, red pearl, and chrysoberyl. At the stūpa, devas of the Trāyastriṃśa paradise scattered coral tree and great coral tree flowers on the precious stūpa, bestrewing it with them, and covering it with them.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1728}} These words came from the precious stūpa: {{note:{index:359,id:UT22084-051-001-1729}}} “The tathāgatas have no thinking, no thoughts, and manifest all modes of conducts. The tathāgatas do not originate from skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas. They do not come into being from karma, kleśas, parents, and the primary elements. They have no connection with flesh, blood, and veins.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1730}} They have no inhalation, no exhalation, and no connection with life. The tathāgatas are the same as space; they are not permanent and not impermanent. However, the tathāgata Prabhūtaratna, who passed into nirvāṇa many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons ago, who is free of thoughts and ideas, is seen for the sake of beings, through the power of his previous prayers, in order that the Dharma be heard and in order to ripen beings, but the body of the Tathāgata is without the slightest thought. The tathāgatas do not speak even a single syllable. The beings who are guided {{note:{index:360,id:UT22084-051-001-1731}}} hear the teaching of the Dharma from the tathāgatas in accord with their individual natures and their individual aspirations. A tathāgata is the true nature, {{page:{number:177,folio:F.89.b}}} and that true nature is the limit of reality. That limit of reality is the essence of phenomena. That true nature, limit of reality, and essence of phenomena is the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma . When the completely pure tathāgatas come, are seen, and speak, through the power of their previous prayers they teach the great skillful method of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma to completely pure beings.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1732}} Then the precious stūpa also said: {{note:{index:361,id:UT22084-051-001-1733}}} “It is excellent, excellent, Bhagavān Śākyamuni, that you have taught well the Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma . It is thus, Bhagavān. It is thus, Sugata!” Those are the words that were emitted.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-3752}} The fourfold assembly became happy, delighted, joyful, and overjoyed on seeing that precious stūpa that remained suspended in the air. At that time they rose from their seats and stood with palms together in homage.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1735}} At that time, the bodhisattva mahāsattva named Mahāpratibhāna, seeing that the world with its devas, humans, and asuras was astonished, asked the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, what is the cause of the appearance of such a great precious stūpa as this? What are the conditions for its appearance? Bhagavān, who uttered the words that came from this great precious stūpa?”
The Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahāpratibhāna, “Mahāpratibhāna, inside this great precious stūpa there is the complete body of a tathāgata. This is his stūpa. He uttered those words.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1737}} “Mahāpratibhāna, in the eastern direction, beyond countless thousands {{note:{index:362,id:UT22084-051-001-1738}}} of worlds, {{page:{number:178,folio:F.90.a}}} there is a world named Ratnaviśuddhā. In that realm there appeared the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna. That bhagavān made a prayer. He said, ‘In the past when I was practicing bodhisattva conduct, the highest, complete enlightenment did not arise while I had not heard the instruction to bodhisattvas, the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma . After I had heard this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma , I attained the highest, complete enlightenment.’ {{note:{index:363,id:UT22084-051-001-1739}}} Mahāpratibhāna, when the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna was about to pass into nirvāṇa, he said to the world and its devas who were before him, ‘Bhikṣus, when I have passed into nirvāṇa, a great precious stūpa that contains my body should be made.’ Mahāpratibhāna, then the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna made this resolution: {{note:{index:364,id:UT22084-051-001-1740}}} ‘This stūpa that is mine, the stūpa that contains my body, may it appear within the buddha realms in world realms in the ten directions wherever this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma will be taught. When those buddha bhagavāns are giving this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma , may it be suspended in the air above the circle of the assembly. May the stūpa that contains my body congratulate the Buddha Bhagavān who is giving this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma .’ {{page:{number:179,folio:F.90.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1741}} “Therefore, Mahāpratibhāna, this is the stūpa that contains the body of the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna, which on my giving this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma in this world realm, Sahā, has appeared from the middle of the circle of the assembly, remained suspended in the air, and congratulated me.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1742}} Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahāpratibhāna said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, through your {{note:{index:365,id:UT22084-051-001-1743}}} power let us see the body of the tathāgata.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-3753}} The Bhagavān replied to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahāpratibhāna, “Mahāpratibhāna, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna made a momentous {{note:{index:366,id:UT22084-051-001-1745}}} prayer. This was his prayer: ‘When buddha bhagavāns in other realms are giving this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma , may the stūpa that contains my body come into the presence of those tathāgatas in order to listen to this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma . When those buddha bhagavāns wish to expose my body and reveal it to the fourfold assembly, then may those tathāgatas assemble together all the emanations from their own bodies that are in the form of tathāgatas in the ten directions, each in their own buddha realm, each with their own name, and teaching the Dharma in those buddha realms. Then afterward, together with those emanations from their own bodies in the forms of tathāgatas, may they open the stūpa that contains my body and reveal it to the fourfold assembly.’
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1746}} “Therefore, Mahāpratibhāna, I shall gather here all my many emanations in the form of tathāgatas teaching the Dharma to beings in other buddha realms in thousands of other world realms.” {{page:{number:180,folio:F.91.a}}}
Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahāpratibhāna said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, we shall pay homage to all those tathāgatas that are emanations from the Tathāgata’s own body.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1748}} Thereupon the Bhagavān emitted a ray of light from his ūrṇā hair. The instant that ray of light shone forth, all those buddha bhagavāns that resided in the eastern direction in hundreds of thousands of quintillions of world realms as numerous as the grains of sand in fifty Ganges Rivers were revealed. The buddha realms with their grounds made of crystal, beautified by trees made of precious materials, adorned by wreaths of calico and silk, filled with many hundred thousands of bodhisattvas, overspread with canopies, and covered with a network of gold and the seven precious materials were revealed. The bhagavāns teaching the Dharma with their mellifluous and gentle voices to beings in those realms were revealed. The hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvas who filled those realms were revealed.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1749}} In the same way in the southeast, in the same way in the south, in the same way in the southwest, in the same way in the west, in the same way in the northwest, in the same way in the north, in the same way in the northeast, in the same way above, in the same way below—in each of the ten directions—all of those many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddha bhagavāns as numerous as the grains of sand in fifty Ganges Rivers, who were in many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of world realms as numerous as the grains of sand in fifty Ganges Rivers, were revealed.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1750}} Those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas in the ten directions each instructed their own multitude of bodhisattvas, {{page:{number:181,folio:F.91.b}}} “Noble youths, I should go to the Sahā world realm, into the presence of the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni, so that I may pay homage to the stūpa that contains the body of the tathāgata Prabhūtaratna!”
So those buddha bhagavāns, accompanied by either one or two {{note:{index:367,id:UT22084-051-001-1752}}} of their own attendants, came to this Sahā world realm.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1753}} At that time this all-containing Sahā world realm became adorned by precious trees. Its ground became made of beryl and was covered with a network of the seven precious materials and of gold. It became perfumed by very precious incense and perfumes. It became strewn with coral tree and great coral tree flowers. It became adorned with strings of little bells. It became divided eightfold like a checkerboard by golden cords. {{note:{index:368,id:UT22084-051-001-1754}}} There were no longer any villages, towns, market towns, districts, countries, or capitals. There were no Kāla mountain ranges. There were no Mucilinda or Mahāmucilinda Mountains. There were no Cakravāla or Mahācakravāla mountain ranges. There were no Sumerus, which are the kings of mountains. There were no other great mountains or mountains. There were no great oceans. There were no rivers or great rivers that were present there. There were no devas, asuras, or humans. There were no hells, animals, or realm of Yama. At that time, apart from those who were in that assembly, all beings that had been born into the six classes of existence in this Sahā world realm were transferred to other world realms.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1755}} The buddha bhagavāns with their one or two attendants then arrived in this Sahā world realm. Having arrived, the tathāgatas approached the bases of precious trees and stayed there. {{page:{number:182,folio:F.92.a}}} Each of those precious trees was five hundred yojanas high, with branches, leaves, and petals in succession at their extremities. {{note:{index:369,id:UT22084-051-001-1756}}} They were perfectly adorned with flowers and fruit. A lion throne had been arranged at the foot of each precious tree. They were five hundred yojanas in height and adorned with huge jewels. Each of the tathāgatas sat cross-legged upon one. In that way, tathāgatas sat cross-legged at the foot of all the precious trees in all the worlds in this world realm of a billion worlds.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1757}} At that time all the worlds in this world realm of a billion worlds were filled with tathāgatas, but all the emanations of the body of the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni had not yet come even from just one direction.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-3754}} The tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni now manifested places for the bodies of the tathāgatas who were coming and arriving. In all ten directions there were two hundred thousand million buddha realms made of beryl, covered with a network made of the seven precious materials and of gold, adorned with strings of little bells, strewn with coral tree and great coral tree flowers, overspread with canopies, hung with divine flower garlands, and perfumed by divine incense and perfume.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1759}} In those two hundred thousand million buddha realms there were no villages, towns, market towns, districts, countries, or capitals. There were no Kāla mountain ranges. There were no Mucilinda or Mahāmucilinda Mountains. There were no Cakravāla or Mahācakravāla mountain ranges. There were no Sumerus, the kings of mountains. There were no other great mountains or mountains. There were no great oceans. {{page:{number:183,folio:F.92.b}}} There were no rivers or great rivers. There were no devas, asuras, or humans. There were no hells, animals, or realm of Yama.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1760}} All those buddha realms were created as if they were one buddha realm, as if they were one land, {{note:{index:370,id:UT22084-051-001-1761}}} which was flat, delightful, and adorned by trees made of the seven precious materials. Those trees were five hundred yojanas high, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit in succession at their extremities. Arranged at the foot of all those precious trees there were magnificent, beautiful lion thrones that were five hundred yojanas in height and were made from divine jewels. The tathāgatas who came and arrived sat cross-legged on the lion thrones in front of those trees. In this way, moreover, Śākyamuni purified {{note:{index:371,id:UT22084-051-001-1762}}} two hundred thousand million buddha realms in each direction in order to create space for the tathāgatas who were coming and arriving.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1763}} In those two hundred thousand million world realms in each direction there were no villages, towns, market towns, districts, countries, or capitals. There were no Kāla mountain ranges. There were no Mucilinda or Mahāmucilinda Mountains. There were no Cakravāla or Mahācakravāla mountain ranges. There were no Sumerus, the kings of mountains. There were no other great mountains or mountains. There were no great oceans. There were no rivers or great rivers. There were no devas, asuras, or humans. There were no hells, animals, or realm of Yama. {{page:{number:184,folio:F.93.a}}} Those beings had been transferred to other world realms.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1764}} Those buddha realms were made of beryl, covered with a network made of the seven precious materials and of gold, adorned with strings of little bells, completely bestrewn with coral tree and great coral tree flowers, overspread with divine canopies, hung with divine flower garlands, perfumed by divine incense and perfume, and adorned by trees made of the seven precious materials. Those trees were five hundred yojanas high, and lion thrones that were five hundred yojanas in height were also manifested. The tathāgatas sat cross-legged on those lion thrones in front of those precious trees.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-3755}} It was then that the tathāgatas emanated by Bhagavān Śākyamuni who had been in the eastern direction, teaching the Dharma in hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddha realms as numerous as the grains of sand in ten million Ganges Rivers, arrived. In the same way they came and arrived from the ten directions and were seated in the eight directions.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1766}} At that time those tathāgatas in each of the eight directions arrived in three hundred million world realms. Then those tathāgatas each sat on their own lion throne and sent their own attendants carrying a basket of precious flowers to Bhagavān Śākyamuni. They said to them, “Noble men, go to the Vulture Peak in Rājagṛha. Pay homage to the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni and with my words ask him and his host of bodhisattvas, and host of śrāvakas, ‘Are you untroubled? Are you well? Are you strong? Are you constantly happy?’ {{page:{number:185,folio:F.93.b}}} Then scatter upon him this heap of jewels and say, ‘The Bhagavān expresses his wish that the Tathāgata’s {{note:{index:372,id:UT22084-051-001-1767}}} precious stūpa be opened.’ ”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1768}} All the tathāgatas sent their attendants in that way. Then the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni, knowing that the entirety of his emanations was assembled, knowing that they were seated on their lion thrones, knowing that the attendants of the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas had all arrived, and knowing that those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas had expressed their wish, rose up from his Dharma seat and remained floating up in the air. The entire fourfold assembly also rose from their seats and stood with hands together in homage, gazing upon the Bhagavān.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1770}} Then the Bhagavān, with the fingers of his right hand, opened the center of the great precious stūpa that was floating in the air. He opened it and separated two parts of the wall panels, as when the two great doors of a great city’s gate separate after the bolt has been removed.
In that way, the Bhagavān, with the fingers of his right hand, opened the center of the great precious stūpa and revealed its interior. As soon as the great precious stūpa of the Tathāgata was opened the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna could be seen, his whole body withered, {{note:{index:373,id:UT22084-051-001-1771}}} seated cross-legged and upright on a lion throne as if he was in meditation. {{page:{number:186,folio:F.94.a}}} He said, “It is excellent, excellent, Bhagavān Śākyamuni, that you have taught well the Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma . It is excellent, Bhagavān Śākyamuni, that you are giving the Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma. {{note:{index:374,id:UT22084-051-001-1772}}} Bhagavān, I have come here to listen to the Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma .”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1773}} The fourfold assembly was amazed and astonished on seeing {{note:{index:375,id:UT22084-051-001-1774}}} the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna, who had passed into nirvāṇa many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons before, speaking.
At that time, heaps of human and divine jewels were tossed toward the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna and the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni. Then the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna offered half the lion throne seat to the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni and from within the great precious stūpa said, “Sit here, Bhagavān Tathāgata Śākyamuni.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1778}} So the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni sat on that half of the lion throne together with that tathāgata. {{note:{index:376,id:UT22084-051-001-1777}}} Both tathāgatas could be seen seated in the center of the great precious stūpa that remained suspended in the air.
The fourfold assembly now thought, “We are far from these tathāgatas; may we also rise up into the air through the power of the tathāgatas!” {{page:{number:187,folio:F.94.b}}}
At this, the Bhagavān, knowing the thoughts in the minds of the fourfold assembly, at that time, through his miraculous power, suspended the fourfold assembly up in the air.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1780}} The bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni then asked the fourfold assembly, “Bhikṣus, who among you in this Sahā world realm has the enthusiasm to give the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma ? This is the moment. This is the time. You are in the presence of the Buddha. Having bestowed the Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma , the Tathāgata wishes to enter nirvāṇa.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1781}} Then the Bhagavān recited these verses:
“Bhikṣus, this great rishi, who is in nirvāṇa, The Guide who entered this precious stūpa, Has come in order to listen to this Dharma. Who would not have diligence for the Dharma? {1}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1783}} “He entered nirvāṇa millions of eons ago But still he listens to the Dharma. He goes here and there for the Dharma; This kind of Dharma is very difficult to find. {2}

In the past, for many hundreds of thousands of eons I was a king who prayed for the highest, complete enlightenment and my mind never wavered from that. I was dedicated to fulfilling the six perfections. I performed immeasurable acts of generosity, giving away gold, jewels, pearls, beryls, conch, crystal, corals, refined gold, silver, emeralds, white coral, red pearls, village towns, market towns, districts, lands, capitals, wives, sons, daughters, male slaves, female slaves, elephants, horses, chariots, and so on, up to my own body—my hands, feet, head, limbs, smaller body parts—and my life. I never had any clinging arise in my mind.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1830}} “At that time, life in this world was long. One lived for many hundreds of thousands of years. During that time I was a king for the sake of the Dharma and not for the sake of dominion. I consecrated my oldest son to be king and dedicated myself to searching in the four directions for the highest Dharma.
“I rang a bell and announced, ‘I will become the slave of anyone who will give me the highest Dharma and teach me its meaning!’
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1832}} “At that time there was a rishi who said to me, ‘Great King, I have the Dharma teaching of the supreme sūtra called The White Lotus of the Good Dharma. {{page:{number:192,folio:F.97.a}}} If you promise to be my slave I will enable you to hear it.’
“When I heard the words of the rishi I was happy, content, delighted, and overjoyed, and I approached that rishi and said to him, ‘I will do whatever work a slave would do for you!’
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1834}} “In that way I promised to be that rishi’s slave and then I did the work of collecting straw, wood, water, roots, tubers, fruit, and so on.

{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1836}} Thereupon, in order to make this clear, the Bhagavān recited these verses:
“I remember how in past eons I was a Dharma king for the sake of the Dharma. I became a king for the sake of the Dharma, Not for pleasures but for the supreme Dharma. {42}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1838}} “I made this declaration in the four directions: ‘I shall be the slave of whoever teaches me the Dharma.’ At that time there was a wise rishi Who taught the sūtra called The Good Dharma . {43}

At that time, on that occasion, I was that king. Bhikṣus, if you have the thought that at that time, on that occasion, the rishi was someone else, do not see it in that way. Why is that?

“Bhikṣus, the lifespan of Tathāgata Devarāja will be twenty intermediate eons long and he will teach the Dharma extensively. Beings as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges will eliminate the kleśas and manifest arhathood. Many beings will develop the aspiration to enlightenment.

All devas and humans will make offerings to it of incense, perfume, flowers, garlands, ointments, powders, cloths, parasols, banners, flags, banners of victory, and so on, and they will praise it in song.
“Whoever will circumambulate that stūpa or bow down to it will manifest the supreme result of arhathood, some will attain pratyeka­buddhahood, and countless, innumerable devas and humans will develop an irreversible aspiration to the highest, supreme enlightenment.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1851}} The Bhagavān then said to the bhikṣus, “Bhikṣus, in future times, noble men or noble women who listen to this chapter from The Sūtra of the White Lotus of the Good Dharma , and having heard it have no doubt, {{note:{index:388,id:UT22084-051-001-1852}}} and with pure minds are dedicated to it, will close the doorway to the lower existences. They will not be reborn in the hells, as an animal, or in the realm of Yama. They will be reborn in the buddha realms in the ten directions and in lifetime after lifetime will hear this sūtra. If they are reborn in a deva or human world they will have a superior status. Whatever buddha realm they are born into, they will be born miraculously in front of the Tathāgata from within a lotus made of the seven precious materials.” {{page:{number:195,folio:F.98.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1853}} At that time the bodhisattva mahāsattva Prajñākūṭa, who had come from the buddha realm of Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna that was in the downward direction, {{note:{index:389,id:UT22084-051-001-1854}}} said to Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna, “Bhagavān, let us return to our own buddha realm.”
But the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni said to the bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa, “Noble one, stay a little while, gain some ascertainment of the Dharma with my bodhisattva mahāsattva Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, and then after that return to your buddha realm.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1856}} At that time, Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, who was seated upon a lotus that had a thousand petals and was the size of a cartwheel, and who was encircled by many bodhisattvas, rose from the palace of the nāga king Sāgara within the ocean high into the sky and floated through the sky to Vulture Peak Mountain, into the presence of the Bhagavān.
Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta descended from the lotus and bowed his head to the feet of Bhagavān Śākyamuni and Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna. He then approached the bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa, spoke with the bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa about many pleasant and joyful things, and then sat down to one side.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1858}} The bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa then asked Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, how many beings have you guided since you entered the ocean?” {{page:{number:196,folio:F.99.a}}}
“I have guided countless, innumerable beings of a number that it is not possible to describe in words or to conceive of in the mind,” answered Mañjuśrī. “Noble one, stay a little while until you see an omen.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1860}} As soon as Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta said those words, many thousands of lotuses rose up into the sky from within the oceans. Many thousands of bodhisattvas were seated upon those lotuses. Then those bodhisattvas came through the sky to Vulture Peak and remained suspended in the sky above it. Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta had guided all of them toward the highest, complete enlightenment. Those bodhisattvas who had previously entered the Mahāyāna praised the six perfections and the qualities of the Mahāyāna, while the bodhisattvas who had previously been śrāvakas praised the Śrāvakayāna. All of them knew the qualities of the Mahāyāna and the emptiness of all phenomena.
Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta said to the bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa, “Noble one, since I entered the ocean I have guided all these beings {{note:{index:390,id:UT22084-051-001-1862}}} that have appeared here.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1863}} Then the bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa asked Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta questions by chanting these verses:
“Great excellent one, who describes wisdom through parables, {{note:{index:391,id:UT22084-051-001-1865}}} You who are the god of humans, I ask you to tell me Through whose power have you become Someone who today has guided countless beings? {47}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1866}} “What sūtra teaches the path to enlightenment?

{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1868}} Mañjuśrī answered, “In the ocean I taught The Sūtra of the White Lotus of the Good Dharma and nothing else.” {{page:{number:197,folio:F.99.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-3756}} “This sūtra is profound, subtle, and difficult to see,” said Prajñākūṭa. “There is no other sūtra that is its equal. Is there a being who is able to comprehend this sūtra jewel and attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood?”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1870}} “Noble one,” answered Mañjuśrī, “there is the daughter of Sāgara, king of the nāgas, who was born eight years ago. She has great wisdom, sharp faculties. The actions of her body, speech, and mind are preceded by wisdom. She has attained the retention by which she remembers the words and meaning of the teachings of all tathāgatas. She has attained in an instant a thousand samādhis of meditation on all phenomena and all beings. She has irreversible aspiration for enlightenment. She has made vast prayers. She cares for all beings as she would for herself. She can develop qualities and never lose them. She has a smiling face. She has a perfect, magnificent complexion. She has a loving mind. She speaks with compassion. She is able to attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1871}} Prajñākūṭa said, “I have seen that when the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni had become a bodhisattva dedicated to attaining enlightenment, he generated much merit, and his diligence never weakened throughout thousands of eons. There is nowhere throughout the worlds of the realm of a billion worlds, not even a place the size of a mustard seed, where he has not given up his own body for the sake of beings. Only after all that did he attain the enlightenment of buddhahood. Who can believe that the daughter of Sāgara could attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood in an instant?”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1872}} Then at that time the daughter of Sāgara, the king of the nāgas, appeared before them. She bowed her head to the feet of the Bhagavān, sat down on one side, and recited these verses:
“His merit, that merit {{note:{index:393,id:UT22084-051-001-1874}}} is profound, And pervades every direction. {{page:{number:198,folio:F.100.a}}} His subtle body is adorned By the thirty-two signs. {49}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1875}} “He has the excellent features. All beings pay homage to him. All beings come to him Like they do to a market town. {50}

{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1877}} At that time Śāriputra said to the daughter of Sāgara, king of the nāgas, “Noble lady, although you have an irreversible aspiration for enlightenment and immeasurable wisdom, it will be difficult for you to attain enlightenment. Noble lady, a woman may maintain diligence, create merit for many thousands of eons, and complete the six perfections, but still she will not attain buddhahood. Why is that? It is because a woman has still not attained five states. What are these five? The first is the state of being a Brahmā, the second is the state of being a Śakra, the third is the state of being one of the four mahārājas, the fourth is the state of being a cakravartin, and the fifth is the state of being an irreversible bodhisattva.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-3757}} At that time, the daughter of Sāgara, king of the nāgas, had a jewel of the value of an entire realm of a billion worlds. The daughter of the nāga king offered it to the Bhagavān, and the Bhagavān accepted it out of compassion.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1878}} The daughter of Sāgara, king of the nāgas, then asked Prajñākūṭa and Sthavira Śāriputra, “Did the Bhagavān quickly accept the jewel that I offered to the Bhagavān, or not?”
“You offered it quickly and the Bhagavān accepted it quickly,” the sthavira answered.
The daughter of Sāgara, king of the nāgas, said, “Venerable Śāriputra, if I have great miraculous power, I will attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood even more quickly than that jewel was accepted.” {{page:{number:199,folio:F.100.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1882}} Thereupon, in front of the entire world, and in front of Sthavira Śāriputra, the daughter of Sāgara, king of the nāgas, manifested the vanishing of her female genitalia, the appearance of male genitalia, and her transformation into a bodhisattva.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-3758}} That bodhisattva now went to the south and, in a southern world realm named Vimalā, manifested the attainment of perfect buddhahood while seated at the foot of a tree made of the seven precious materials.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1884}} That buddha had a body that possessed all thirty-two signs and the excellent features, and shone with a light that pervaded the ten directions as he gave the teaching of the Dharma. All beings in this Sahā world realm saw all the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans paying homage to that tathāgata and saw him teaching them the Dharma. All those beings who listened to that tathāgata’s Dharma teaching attained irreversible progress toward the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1885}} That Vimalā world realm and this Sahā world realm both shook in six ways. Three thousand beings within the circle of Bhagavān Śākyamuni’s assembly attained receptivity to the birthlessness of phenomena, and three thousand received the prophecies of their attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment.
At this, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Prajñākūṭa and Sthavira Śāriputra fell silent.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-3699}} This concludes “The Appearance of the Stūpa,” the eleventh chapter of the Dharma teaching of “ The White Lotus of the Good Dharma .” {{page:{number:200,folio:F.101.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1888}} Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja and the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahāpratibhāna, together with a following of two hundred thousand bodhisattvas, facing the Bhagavān, said, “Bhagavān, have no concern over this matter. Bhagavān, we will teach, we will expound this Dharma teaching to beings after the nirvāṇa of the Tathāgata.
“Bhagavān, in that time beings will be wicked, have few roots of merit, be arrogant, be devoted to gain and honor, engage in roots of demerit, be difficult to guide, have no interest, and be filled with disinterest, but, Bhagavān, we will demonstrate the power of patience and in that time we will teach this sūtra, we will uphold it, we will expound it, we will write it out, we will honor it, we will venerate it, and we will make offerings to it. Bhagavān, we will cast aside body and life and teach this sūtra. Therefore, Bhagavān, have no concern.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1890}} That assembly’s bhikṣus, both those in training and those who had passed beyond training, and the five hundred bhikṣus, then said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, we too are resolved to teach this Dharma teaching and will do so in other world realms.”
Thereupon the Bhagavān gave prophecies of the highest, complete enlightenment to all the Bhagavān’s śrāvakas, both those in training and those who had passed beyond training. All the eight thousand bhikṣus, with their hands together in homage, bowed toward the Bhagavān and said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, do not be concerned. In the later times, in the later era, after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, we also will expound this Dharma teaching in other world realms. {{page:{number:201,folio:F.101.b}}} Why is that? Bhagavān, the beings in this Sahā world realm will be arrogant, with few roots of merit, constantly malicious, deceitful, and dishonest.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1892}} The Bhagavān’s maternal aunt Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī and six thousand bhikṣunīs, both bhikṣunīs in training and those who had passed beyond training, now arose from their seats at the same time, with their hands together in homage, bowed toward the Bhagavān, and stood there gazing at the Bhagavān.
The Bhagavān said to Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, “Gautamī, do not stand {{note:{index:394,id:UT22084-051-001-1894}}} gazing at the Tathāgata, unhappily thinking, ‘The Tathāgata has not spoken to me, has not prophesied the highest, complete enlightenment for me.’ For when I gave a prophecy to the entire assembly, you too, Gautamī, received a prophecy accordingly.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1895}} “Gautamī, from now on you will be a bodhisattva mahāsattva dharmabhāṇaka under thirty-eight hundred thousand quintillion buddhas.

“Gautamī, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana will give a prophecy to those six thousand bodhisattvas {{page:{number:202,folio:F.102.a}}} of their successive attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1900}} Then the bhikṣunī Yaśodharā, the mother of Rāhula, thought, “The Bhagavān has not said my name.”
The Bhagavān, knowing the thoughts that were in the mind of Bhikṣunī Yaśodharā, said to Bhikṣunī Yaśodharā, “Yaśodharā, I declare to you, I make it known to you, {{note:{index:395,id:UT22084-051-001-1902}}} that you will be a bodhisattva dharmabhāṇaka under a hundred thousand million buddhas.

{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1904}} At this, Bhikṣunī Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī and her following of six thousand bhikṣunīs, and Bhikṣunī Yaśodharā and her following of four thousand bhikṣunīs, were astonished and amazed by obtaining from the Bhagavān the prophecy of their highest, complete enlightenment.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1905}} At that time they recited this verse:
“Bhagavān, you are the Instructor, the Guide, The Teacher of the world and its devas. You bring relief and devas and humans make offerings to you. And today we also, Lord, have been made content.” {1}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1907}} Having recited that verse, the bhikṣunīs said to the Bhagavān, {{page:{number:203,folio:F.102.b}}} “Bhagavān, we too are resolved to teach this Dharma teaching in a future time, in a future era, in other world realms.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-3759}} The Bhagavān now looked toward the eighty thousand {{note:{index:396,id:UT22084-051-001-1909}}} bodhisattvas who had attained retention and had turned the irreversible Dharma wheel.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1910}} As soon as the Bhagavān looked at them, those bodhisattva mahāsattvas rose from their seats. With their hands placed together in homage they bowed toward the Bhagavān and thought, “The Bhagavān is going to exhort us to teach this Dharma teaching.” At that thought, they all trembled and said to each other, “Noble ones, if the Bhagavān exhorts us to teach this Dharma teaching in the future times, how shall we respond?”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-1911}} Then those noble ones, because of their veneration for the Bhagavān and because of their past practice and prayers, roared the lion’s roar in the presence of the Bhagavān. “Bhagavān, in the future time when the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, we will go into the ten directions, and through the power of the Bhagavān we will have beings write out this Dharma teaching, recite it, contemplate it, and teach it.

In order to make happy the fourfold assembly he gives them the gift of the town of nirvāṇa and the great city of the Dharma, teaching them through nirvāṇa, {{note:{index:416,id:UT22084-051-001-2027}}} but not teaching them this kind of Dharma teaching. {{page:{number:216,folio:F.109.a}}}

“Mañjuśrī, just as that king keeps the crest jewel fixed upon his topknot for a long time, in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha, who is the great King of the Dharma, while he is the King of the Dharma sees the śrāvakas and bodhisattvas battling with the Māra of the skandhas or the Māra of the kleśas. When they battle with them, desire, anger, and ignorance cease, they escape from all three realms, and have the great strength of a great being who defeats all the māras. This pleases the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly awakened Buddha, who then teaches those ārya warriors this kind of Dharma teaching, which is contrary to the world, which is not believed in by the world, which has previously not been expounded, which has previously not been taught.

“Bhagavān, if the Bhagavān will permit us, {{page:{number:220,folio:F.111.a}}} after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, we too will teach this Dharma teaching in the Sahā world realm. We will read it, write it, and make offerings to it. We shall be dedicated to this Dharma teaching. Bhagavān, teach well this Dharma teaching to us.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2076}} The Bhagavān then asked all those bodhisattvas, “Noble ones, why would you need to do this?

Each one of those bodhisattvas has, as followers, thousands of bodhisattvas who are themselves as numerous as the grains of sand in sixty Ganges Rivers, and each of those bodhisattvas has that many followers, too. In the future times, after I have passed into nirvāṇa, they will possess this Dharma teaching and they will teach it.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2077}} As soon as the Bhagavān had uttered those words, this entire Sahā world realm cracked apart completely, was rent with fissures, and there came out from within those fissures the bodhisattvas who lived in the Sahā world realm, the many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of bodhisattvas, with their golden bodies and their thirty-two signs of a great being, who dwelled in the element of space beneath the great earth. They had heard the Bhagavān’s words, and came out from under the ground.

{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2079}} Those bodhisattva mahāsattvas who were beyond number, calculation, simile, or comparison emerged from the ground of the Sahā world realm. When they had emerged they went toward the precious stūpa suspended in the air within which the bhagavān tathāgata Prabhūtaratna, who had passed into nirvāṇa, and the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni were sitting together upon a lion throne. When they arrived there, they bowed their heads to the feet of both tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas.
They bowed down and paid homage to the emanations of the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni, the bodies of the tathāgatas who had gathered from the other world realms in the ten directions, the bhagavāns who were seated on lion thrones at the foot of trees made of various precious materials.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2081}} They circumambulated those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas hundreds of thousands of times and they praised them with many kinds of bodhisattva praises, and then they stood to one side with their hands together in homage and they paid homage to the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni {{page:{number:223,folio:F.112.b}}} and the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2082}} At that time those bodhisattva mahāsattvas who had emerged from the ground paid homage to the tathāgatas and praised them with various bodhisattva praises for fifty intermediate eons. During those fifty intermediate eons Bhagavān Śākyamuni remained silent, and the fourfold assembly also remained silent for those fifty intermediate eons.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-3763}} The Bhagavān now brought about a miracle, such that through that miracle the fourfold assembly thought those eons were just one afternoon. They saw this Sahā world realm became the size of a hundred thousand world realms and filled with bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2084}} There were four bodhisattva mahāsattvas who were the principal ones among that great gathering of bodhisattvas, that great aggregation of bodhisattvas.

Those four bodhisattva mahāsattvas were the principal figures among that great gathering of bodhisattvas, that great aggregation of bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2085}} Those four bodhisattva mahāsattvas now stood before that great gathering of bodhisattvas, that great aggregation of bodhisattvas, and in front of the Bhagavān, with hands placed together in homage, they inquired of the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, do you have few troubles, do you have little illness, are you happy? Bhagavān, are the beings in your care of good character? {{page:{number:224,folio:F.113.a}}} Do they have good understanding? Are they easy to guide? Are they easy to purify? Are they not a cause of sadness for the Bhagavān?”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2086}} Those four bodhisattvas then spoke these verses to the Bhagavān:
“Lord of the World, who shines with light, Are you dwelling in happiness? Are you free from illness? {{note:{index:428,id:UT22084-051-001-2088}}} Is your sinless body well? {1}

{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2090}} In reply, the Bhagavān answered those four bodhisattva mahāsattvas who were the principal figures among that great gathering of bodhisattvas, that great aggregation of bodhisattvas, “Noble ones, it is like this: I dwell in happiness; I have little harm, little illness. The beings in my care are of good character, have good understanding, are easily guided, and are easily purified. They do not cause me sadness while they are being purified. Why is that? Noble ones, it is because these beings of mine have trained during the time of previous perfectly enlightened buddhas.

{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2092}} At this those bodhisattva mahāsattvas responded with these verses:
“Excellent! Excellent, great hero! We are overjoyed That the beings {{note:{index:430,id:UT22084-051-001-2094}}} under your care have good character, Are easy to guide, easy to purify, {3}

Buddha Śākyamuni is going to answer, so you should listen to him.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-3765}} The Bhagavān then said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, “Ajita, this question you have asked me concerning this vast subject is excellent, Ajita, excellent!”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2133}} The Bhagavān now turned to the entire assembly of bodhisattvas and announced to them, “Noble ones, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha is going to teach the Tathāgata’s wisdom insight, the Tathāgata’s leadership, the Tathāgata’s activity, the Tathāgata’s displays, the Tathāgata’s expanding power, and the Tathāgata’s heroism. {{note:{index:435,id:UT22084-051-001-2135}}} Therefore, noble ones, this entire assembly of bodhisattvas should be attentive, focused, and stable.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2136}} Thereupon the Bhagavān pronounced these verses:
“All you noble ones, be attentive: I am going to speak infallible {{note:{index:436,id:UT22084-051-001-2138}}} words. Wise ones, do not become disheartened. The wisdom of the tathāgatas is inconceivable. {33} {{page:{number:229,folio:F.115.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2139}} “You should all be stable and mindful. You should all remain in a state of concentration. Listen to a Dharma that has not appeared before And which is a marvel of the tathāgatas. {34}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2140}} “I shall establish you well in this. None of you should have any doubt. I, the Guide, speak infallibly. {{note:{index:437,id:UT22084-051-001-2141}}} My wisdom remains forever incalculable. {35}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2142}} “The Sugata has realized profound dharmas, Which are unexaminable and unquantifiable. I am going to teach {{note:{index:438,id:UT22084-051-001-2143}}} those dharmas; Listen to me as to what they are and how they are.” {36}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2144}} Having pronounced those verses, Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, “Ajita, I declare to you, I proclaim to you, {{note:{index:439,id:UT22084-051-001-2145}}} Ajita, as for these innumerable, numberless, inconceivable, unequaled, uncountable bodhisattvas whom you have never seen before, who emerged from the ground, after I had attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood in this Sahā world realm, Ajita, I inspired and developed {{note:{index:440,id:UT22084-051-001-2146}}} all these bodhisattva mahāsattvas toward the highest, complete enlightenment. Noble ones, I ripened them for this bodhisattva Dharma, established them in it, and caused them to follow it, remain in it, and understand it.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2147}} “Ajita, these bodhisattva mahāsattvas live in this Sahā world realm by occupying the realm of space below, where they are engaged in reciting and receiving the teachings, and correctly contemplating them.
“These noble ones do not delight in the activities of society, they delight in the absence of society. Their diligence does not weaken, they apply themselves with diligence. Ajita, these noble ones delight in solitude and find pleasure in solitude. These noble ones do not live by relying upon either devas or humans. These noble ones delight in activities that are devoid of worldly gatherings, delight in the pleasure of the Dharma, and are dedicated to the wisdom of buddhahood.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2149}} The Bhagavān then spoke these verses: {{page:{number:230,folio:F.116.a}}}
“These bodhisattvas are innumerable. They are countless and beyond measure. They possess miracles, wisdom, and learning, And for many millions of eons have practiced with knowledge. {37}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2151}} “I have ripened them all for enlightenment And they dwell within my own realm. All of these I have ripened— These bodhisattvas are my offspring. {38}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2152}} “They all are dedicated to solitude And reject the level of worldly gatherings. They follow the example of my supreme conduct; These children of mine practice free from worldly gatherings. {39}

{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2157}} “You should all have faith when you hear These immaculate words of mine. I have, in that way, ripened all of these Since I attained supreme enlightenment.” {43}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2158}} The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya and the many hundred thousands of quintillions of bodhisattvas were then astonished and amazed. How could the Buddha in a moment—in such a short time—inspire and ripen for the highest, complete enlightenment all these countless bodhisattvas?
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-3766}} So the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya inquired of the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, when the Tathāgata was a young man, you left the Śākya town of Kapilavastu for homelessness. You went to the supreme Bodhimaṇḍa that is not very far from the city of Gayā. You attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood. {{page:{number:231,folio:F.116.b}}} Bhagavān, since that time until today more than forty years have passed. Bhagavān, how could the Tathāgata in such a short time as this accomplish such countless tathāgata activities as these? How did you attain the preeminence of a tathāgata, and the heroism of a tathāgata? {{note:{index:442,id:UT22084-051-001-2160}}} Bhagavān, you have inspired and ripened for the highest, complete enlightenment this great gathering of bodhisattva mahāsattvas, this great aggregation of bodhisattvas, in just that amount of time. Bhagavān, one would not be able to count this great gathering of bodhisattva mahāsattvas, this great aggregation of bodhisattvas, even in a hundred thousand quintillion eons. Bhagavān, such innumerable, countless bodhisattvas have practiced celibacy for a long time, creating roots of merit under many hundreds of thousands of buddhas, and perfecting themselves over many hundreds of thousands of eons.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2161}} “Bhagavān, it is as if there were a young man, a lad of twenty-five years of age, with black hair, in the first phase of his adulthood, who revealed that he has sons that are a hundred years old. He says, ‘These noble ones are my sons; they are my sons,’ and they say, ‘This man is our father.’ Bhagavān, what they say would not be believed. It would be difficult for the world to believe them.
“Bhagavān, similarly, it is not very long since you, Tathāgata, attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood. These countless, innumerable bodhisattva mahāsattvas have practiced celibacy for many hundreds of thousands of eons; they have gained certainty in the wisdom of buddhahood during a long period of time; they are skilled in resting in hundreds of thousands of samādhis; {{page:{number:232,folio:F.117.a}}} they have developed the great higher knowledges; they are wise in the level of buddhahood; they are skilled in teaching the dharmas of the Tathāgata; they are an amazement and wonder in this world; and they have attained great diligence, strength, and might.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2163}} “The Bhagavān has said of them, ‘I am the one who first established them on the level of being a bodhisattva; I am the one who has ripened and developed them. It is through my attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood that I have accomplished all this diligence and heroism.’
“Bhagavān, we will have faith in whatever the Tathāgata says, thinking, ‘The Tathāgata speaks infallibly. The Tathāgata knows the truth.’ However, Bhagavān, those newly following in the Bodhisattva­yāna will have doubts. After the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, they will hear this Dharma teaching and they will not believe it, will not have faith in it, and will not be attracted to it. Therefore, Bhagavān, they will accrue the karma of rejecting the Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2165}} “Therefore, Bhagavān, explain the meaning of this well, so that we will not have any kind of doubt in this Dharma, and so that in the future time, when noble men and noble women who are on the Bodhisattva­yāna hear it, they will not doubt it.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2166}} The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya then addressed these verses to the Bhagavān:
“You were born in Kapilāhvaya, But then you renounced the residence of the Śākyas, And attained enlightenment by the city of Gayā. Lord of the World, it has not been long since then. {44}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2168}} “These fearless ones and many others in this great crowd Have practiced for millions of eons. They are unwaveringly established in miraculous powers. Excellently learned, they have realized the power of wisdom. {45}

{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2170}} “How can the bodhisattvas believe In such a marvel of yours as this? Tell us so that doubts will be overcome. Teach the meaning of this exactly as it is. {47}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2171}} “It is as if there were a person, A youth, a young lad with black hair Who was born just over twenty years before, Who introduces hundred-year-old men as his sons. {48}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2172}} “They are wrinkled, with white hair, and they say, ‘This is the one who has fathered us.’ Lord of the World, it would be difficult to believe That such men as those could be the youth’s sons. {49}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2173}} “In the same way, the Bhagavān is like that young man, While these numerous bodhisattvas who have knowledge, And are mindful, fearless, and endowed with wisdom, Have trained excellently for billions of eons. {50}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2174}} “They have stability, skill in wisdom, Are all good looking and beautiful, Have certainty in the Dharma, are fearless, And are praised {{note:{index:443,id:UT22084-051-001-2175}}} by the guides of the worlds. {51}

{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2180}} Then the Bhagavān said to the complete assembly of bodhisattvas, “Noble ones, have faith and certainty in the true words that I, the Tathāgata, will speak.”
The Bhagavān said a second time, and a third time, to those bodhisattvas, “Noble ones, have faith and certainty in the true words that I, the Tathāgata, will speak. Noble ones, have faith and certainty in the true words that I, the Tathāgata, will speak.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2182}} At this, the complete assembly of bodhisattvas, with bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya standing in front to them, with hands together in homage, requested, “Bhagavān, explain the meaning to us. Sugata, explain it to us. We will believe what the Tathāgata says.” A second time, the complete assembly of bodhisattvas requested the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, explain the meaning to us. Sugata, explain it to us. We will believe what the Tathāgata says.” A third time, the complete assembly of bodhisattvas requested the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, explain the meaning to us. Sugata, explain it to us. We will believe what the Tathāgata says.”
Then the Bhagavān, knowing that the bodhisattvas had made their request three times, said to those bodhisattvas, “And so, noble ones, listen to what has arisen because of the power of my samādhi. {{note:{index:444,id:UT22084-051-001-2185}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2184}} “Noble ones, the world with its devas, humans, and asuras thinks and believes, ‘Bhagavān Śākyamuni departed from his Śākya clan into mendicancy, went to the preeminent, supreme Bodhimaṇḍa, and attained the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood by the city of Gayā.’ {{page:{number:235,folio:F.118.b}}} However, noble ones, I attained the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons ago.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2187}} “Noble sons, it is like this: If there were a man who picked up one atom from among the atoms of the element of earth in countless {{note:{index:445,id:UT22084-051-001-2188}}} fifty hundred thousand quintillion world realms, and he were to carry it in an eastern direction until he had passed countless, fifty hundred thousand quintillion world realms, and were then to deposit that atom there; and if he were to continue on further in that way {{note:{index:446,id:UT22084-051-001-2189}}} until the entire element of earth in all those world realms was gone, depositing the atoms in that manner, in that way, into world realms in an eastern direction, then, noble ones, do you think that anyone could conceive of, or calculate, count, or determine the number of those world realms?”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2190}} The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya and the complete assembly of bodhisattvas said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, those world realms are numberless, are innumerable, and are beyond the capacity of the mind. Bhagavān, even all the śrāvakas and pratyeka­buddhas with their higher wisdom could not conceive of, calculate, or determine their number. Bhagavān, even for us bodhisattvas on the level of irreversibility this subject is beyond the scope of our thoughts. Bhagavān, the number of those world realms would be incalculable.”
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2191}} The Bhagavān said to those bodhisattva mahāsattvas, “Noble ones, I declare to you, I proclaim to you, {{note:{index:447,id:UT22084-051-001-2192}}} {{page:{number:236,folio:F.119.a}}} noble ones, in those world realms in which that man would deposit atoms, and, noble sons, those in which he did not deposit them, there are not, in all those hundreds of thousands of quintillions of world realms, noble sons, as many atoms as there are hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons since I attained the highest complete enlightenment of buddhahood. Since I began teaching the Dharma to beings in this Sahā world realm and in another hundred thousand quintillion world realms, noble ones, those other tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas whom I have previously mentioned, beginning with Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, and the passing into nirvāṇa of those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas, were my emanations, noble ones, in order to accomplish the teaching of the Dharma through skillful methods. Moreover, noble ones, the Tathāgata, on seeing the extent of the faculties and diligence of the successive beings of future times, states what will be his name in those times, and states when his passing into nirvāṇa will occur, and in that way he will satisfy beings with various kinds of Dharma teachings. {{note:{index:448,id:UT22084-051-001-2193}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2194}} “Noble ones, the Tathāgata says to beings with various aspirations, few roots of merit, and many kleśas, ‘Bhikṣus, I am young; I renounced my family and it has not been long, bhikṣus, since I have attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.’
“Noble ones, even though it has thus been a long time since the Tathāgata attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood, he says, ‘It has not been long since I attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.’ {{page:{number:237,folio:F.119.b}}} That kind of Dharma was taught solely for the purpose of ripening beings and bringing them into the teaching.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2196}} “Noble ones, all those Dharma teachings were taught by the Tathāgata in order to guide beings.
“Noble ones, the words the Tathāgata speaks in order to guide beings, whether spoken by myself or spoken by someone else, whether concerning myself or concerning anyone else—whatever Dharma teachings the Tathāgata has taught, all are the truth that is spoken by the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata does not lie.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2198}} “Why is that? The Tathāgata has seen the three realms exactly as they are: {{note:{index:449,id:UT22084-051-001-2199}}} there is no birth, no death, no transmigration, no becoming, no saṃsāra, no nirvāṇa, no being, no nonbeing, no existence, no nonexistence, no ‘like this,’ no ‘not like this,’ no ‘untrue,’ and no ‘not untrue.’ The Tathāgata does not see the three realms in the way that ordinary, foolish beings see them. Concerning this, the Tathāgata has the direct perception of phenomena, and there is no phenomenon of which he is oblivious. Therefore, whatever the Tathāgata says is all the truth, without any lies. However, as beings have different kinds of conduct, different kinds of aspirations, and different kinds of perception and conception, in order that they may develop roots of merit, the Tathāgata teaches many kinds of Dharma teachings, with many kinds of goals.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2200}} “Noble ones, whatever the Tathāgata has to do, that is what the Tathāgata does. The Tathāgata, who has attained perfect buddhahood a long time ago, has an immeasurable lifespan. {{page:{number:238,folio:F.120.a}}} He always remains and does not pass into nirvāṇa, but creates the appearance of passing into nirvāṇa in order to benefit his students.
“Noble ones, I still have an entire lifespan of twice times a hundred thousand quintillion eons. Although I will not pass into nirvāṇa, I state that I am going to pass into nirvāṇa. Why is that? Noble ones, it is in order to ripen beings through this Dharma teaching. If I were not to pass into nirvāṇa and were to remain for a long time, because I would be constantly seen, beings would not create roots of merit. They would become destitute, devoid of merit, indulging in desires, blind, and caught in the net of wrong views. Thinking, ‘The Tathāgata remains,’ they would perceive him as easy to meet {{note:{index:450,id:UT22084-051-001-2202}}} and would not perceive him as difficult to meet. They would think, ‘The Tathāgata is with us,’ and would not be diligently dedicated to escaping from the three realms. They would not view a tathāgata as being rare.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2203}} “Therefore, noble ones, the Tathāgata, using skillful method, states, ‘Bhikṣus, it is very difficult to find the appearance of the tathāgatas.’ Why is that? For those beings, it is possible that they may see a tathāgata after many hundred thousands of quintillions of eons, and it is possible that they will not.
“Noble ones, considering this, I say, ‘Bhikṣus, the appearance of a tathāgata is difficult to find,’ so that conceiving that the appearance of a tathāgata is difficult to find they perceive it as a wonder, and they have the understanding that a tathāgata passes into nirvāṇa. When they do not see the Tathāgata, {{note:{index:451,id:UT22084-051-001-2205}}} {{page:{number:239,folio:F.120.b}}} they will thirst for the sight of him. The roots of merit from the mind being focused upon the Tathāgata will bring good results, benefits, and happiness for a long time. Knowing this, for the sake of those to be guided, the Tathāgata announces that he will pass into nirvāṇa even though he does not pass into nirvāṇa.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2206}} “Noble ones, that which the Tathāgata states is a Dharma teaching; he does not speak lies.
“Noble ones, it is as if there were a man who is a physician who is wise, eminent, learned, intelligent, very skilled, {{note:{index:452,id:UT22084-051-001-2208}}} and could cure all illnesses, and that man has many sons—ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, or a thousand. That physician goes away to somewhere else, and all his sons take a poisonous drink, or a venomous drink. As a result of that poison or venom, they are tormented and tortured by the sensations of suffering and roll around on the ground. Then their father, the physician, returns from his journey. His sons are in distress from the suffering caused by that poison or venom. Some have deluded perceptions and some do not have deluded perception but all are in distress from suffering. They are happy to see their father and say to him, ‘Father, you have returned happily and safely. Free us from this poison or venom that is destroying our bodies. Save our lives!’

They become completely free from all illness. His sons who have deluded perception praise their father, saying, ‘Father, you have returned happily and safely. Heal us!’ but they do not drink the medicine. Why is that? Because their perception is deluded, they did not like the color of the medicine, did not like its smell, and did not like its taste. Then the physician thinks, ‘These sons of mine have deluded perception because of the poison or venom and so will not drink the medicine, but they are praising me. I will use a skillful method to make them drink this medicine.’
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2211}} “Then the physician, wishing to use a skillful method to make his sons drink the medicine, says to them, ‘Noble ones, I am old, advanced in years, and aged. The time of my death is close. Sons, do not be sad. Do not be unhappy. If you need great medicine, take this medicine.’ Having instructed them in this way as a skillful method he goes to another land, and having gone there, sends news to his sick sons that he is dying. Then they become very sad, wail and weep, thinking, ‘Our only father, protector, progenitor, who had compassion for us has died, and so now we have no protector!’ They see that they are without a protector; they see that they have no refuge, and are overcome by sorrow.
{{milestone:UT22084-051-001-2212}} “Through becoming overcome by sorrow, those whose perceptions are deluded gain undeluded perception. Then they can perceive the color, aroma, and taste of the medicine’s color, aroma, and taste, and at that time they drink it. {{page:{number:241,folio:F.121.b}}} Once they have drunk it they become free from their illness.

“No, Bhagavān,” they answered. “No, Sugata.”
