Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was staying at Vulture Peak Mountain by Rājagṛha, together with a great saṅgha of eight hundred monks, and with forty-two thousand bodhisattvas. At that time, a bodhisattva great being by the name Amalagarbha, accompanied by ninety-two thousand other bodhisattvas, set out from the world known as Immaculate Conduct—the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Saṃkusumita. They traveled to Vulture Peak Mountain, here in this Sahā world, where the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Śākyamuni dwelled. 
{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-040-005-19}}}As the bodhisattva great being Amalagarbha arrived in the sky, surrounded and attended by a great assembly of bodhisattvas, the Blessed One noticed him. As he caught sight of him, the Blessed One thought, “The bodhisattva great being Amalagarbha has been dispatched here by the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Saṃkusumita in order to receive the Dharma teaching called The Exposition on the Universal Gateway. Therefore, I, for my part, should gather the bodhisattvas.” Then, because the Blessed One formed this intent, all bodhisattva great beings residing in boundless, infinite worlds{{note:{index:7,id:UT22084-040-005-20}}} arrived at Vulture Peak Mountain here in this Sahā world to meet the Blessed One. 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-040-005-21}}}Upon arrival, they bowed their heads to the Blessed One’s feet and sat down to one side. {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-040-005-370,folio:F.185.b}}} All the bodhisattva great beings at Vulture Peak Mountain who had retired for meditation{{note:{index:8,id:UT22084-040-005-22}}} also gathered. The bodhisattva great being Amalagarbha then went before the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Śākyamuni, holding a thousand-petaled lotus flower made of the seven precious substances. He bowed his head to the Blessed One’s feet and offered him the thousand-petaled lotus. 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-040-005-23}}}Amalagarbha then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Saṃkusumita from the world Immaculate Conduct inquiries about the Blessed One’s health. Does the Blessed One have but little trouble, grief, and agitation?{{note:{index:9,id:UT22084-040-005-24}}} Is he in good health, strong, and at ease? Is the Blessed One free of illness and does he have but few troubles?” When he had thus inquired after the Blessed One’s health, he added, “Might the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Śākyamuni deliver the Dharma teaching pertaining to the inconceivable Exposition on the Universal Gateway to the bodhisattva great beings?” Then, having asked the Blessed One in this way, the bodhisattva great being Amalagarbha sat down cross-legged in the sky in the midst of his retinue of bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-040-005-25}}}At that time, Prince Mañjuśrī was also present within that assembly.{{note:{index:10,id:UT22084-040-005-26}}} He rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and said, “In order to foster the bodhisattvas, I request the Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One, to thoroughly expound the Dharma teaching pertaining to the inconceivable Exposition on the Universal Gateway. Blessed One, {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-040-005-371,folio:F.186.a}}} I beseech you. In the past, I received this teaching from the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Bright Lamp and thereby developed eighty-four sextillion absorptions. I also understood seventy-seven sextillion approaches to accomplishing dhāraṇīs. That being the case, may the Blessed One also teach this thoroughly in order to foster these bodhisattvas.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-040-005-27}}}In response, the Blessed One said the following to Prince Mañjuśrī: “To this effect, Mañjuśrī, listen carefully and keep in mind what I explain.”
