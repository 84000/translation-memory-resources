{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-10}} {{page:{number:1,folio:F.116.a}}} Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-11}} Thus have I heard at one time. The Bhagavān was residing on Vulture Peak mountain in Rājagṛha with a large saṅgha of 1,250 bhikṣus and with a great many bodhisattva mahāsattvas. At that time, venerable Śāriputra went to the place frequented by the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya and, after they had exchanged courtesies upon meeting each other, they both sat down on a flat rock.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-12}} Venerable Śāriputra then said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, “Maitreya, here today, the Bhagavān, gazing at a rice seedling, spoke this aphorism {{note:{index:2,id:UT22084-062-010-13}}} to the bhikṣus: ‘Bhikṣus, whoever sees dependent arising sees the Dharma. {{note:{index:3,id:UT22084-062-010-14}}} Whoever sees the Dharma sees the Buddha.’ Having said this, the Bhagavān fell silent. Maitreya, what is the meaning of this aphorism spoken by the Sugata? {{note:{index:4,id:UT22084-062-010-15}}} What is dependent arising? What is the Dharma? What is the Buddha? How does one see the Dharma by seeing dependent arising? How does one see the Buddha by seeing the Dharma?”
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-16}} The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya then replied to the venerable Śāradvatīputra, {{note:{index:5,id:UT22084-062-010-17}}} “Venerable Śāriputra, you want to know what dependent arising is in the statement made by the Bhagavān, the Lord of Dharma, the Omniscient One: ‘Bhikṣus, whoever sees dependent arising sees the Dharma. Whoever sees the Dharma sees the Buddha’? Well, the phrase dependent arising means that something arises because something else already exists; something is born because something else was already born. {{note:{index:6,id:UT22084-062-010-18}}} That is to say, ignorance causes formations. Formations {{page:{number:2,folio:F.116.b}}} cause consciousness. Consciousness causes name and form. Name and form cause the six sense sources. The six sense sources cause contact. Contact causes sensation. Sensation causes craving. Craving causes appropriation. Appropriation causes becoming. Becoming causes birth. And birth causes aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, despair, and anxiety. Thus does this entire great heap of suffering arise.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-19}} “When ignorance ceases, formations cease. When formations cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense sources cease. When the six sense sources cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, sensation ceases. When sensation ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, appropriation ceases. When appropriation ceases, becoming ceases. When becoming ceases, birth ceases. And when birth ceases, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, despair, and anxiety cease. Thus does this entire great heap of suffering cease. This is what the Bhagavān has called dependent arising.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-20}} “What is the Dharma? The Dharma is the eightfold path of the noble ones: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. This eightfold path of the noble ones, combined with the attainment of its results and nirvāṇa, is what the Bhagavān has called the Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-21}} “Who is the Bhagavān Buddha? A buddha , so-called because of comprehending all dharmas, {{note:{index:7,id:UT22084-062-010-22}}} is endowed with the wisdom eye of the noble ones and the body {{page:{number:3,folio:F.117.a}}} of Dharma, {{note:{index:8,id:UT22084-062-010-23}}} and thus perceives the dharmas {{note:{index:9,id:UT22084-062-010-24}}} of those still in training and those beyond training.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-25}} “How does one see dependent arising? On this point the Bhagavān said, ‘One who sees dependent arising as constant, {{note:{index:10,id:UT22084-062-010-26}}} without life force, devoid of life force, true, unmistaken, unborn, not arisen, uncreated, uncompounded, unobstructed, imperceptible, tranquil, {{note:{index:11,id:UT22084-062-010-27}}} fearless, incontrovertible, inexhaustible, and by nature never stilled, {{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-062-010-28}}} and who likewise sees the Dharma to also be constant, without life force, devoid of life force, true, unmistaken, unborn, not arisen, uncreated, uncompounded, unobstructed, imperceptible, tranquil, fearless, incontrovertible, inexhaustible, and never stilled, clearly understands the Dharma of the nobles ones, and by thus acquiring such right knowledge, sees the Buddha, the body of the unsurpassable Dharma.’ {{note:{index:13,id:UT22084-062-010-29}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-30}} “Why is it called dependent arising ? It is called dependent arising because it is causal and conditional, not non-causal and non-conditional. In this connection, the Bhagavān concisely taught the characteristics of dependent arising as follows: ‘Results come from their own specific conditions. Whether tathāgatas appear or not, this true nature of things {{note:{index:14,id:UT22084-062-010-31}}} will remain. It is the true nature; the constancy of Dharma; {{note:{index:15,id:UT22084-062-010-32}}} the immutability of Dharma, {{note:{index:16,id:UT22084-062-010-33}}} consistent with dependent arising, suchness, unmistaken suchness, unchanging suchness, actuality, and truth; unmistaken; and unerring.’
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-34}} “Moreover, dependent arising emerges from two principles. {{page:{number:4,folio:F.117.b}}} From what two principles? From a causal relation and a conditional relation. Furthermore, it should be understood as twofold: outer and inner.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-35}} “What is the causal relation in outer dependent arising? It is as follows. From a seed comes a sprout, from a sprout a leaf, from a leaf a stem, from a stem a pedicel, from a pedicel a pistil, from a pistil a flower, and from a flower comes a fruit. If there is no seed, the sprout cannot arise and so on, until finally, without the flower, the fruit cannot arise. If there is a seed, the sprout will form and so on, until finally, if there is a flower, then the fruit will form.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-36}} “In that process, the seed does not think, ‘I form the sprout.’ Nor does the sprout think, ‘I am formed by the seed.’ Likewise, the flower does not think, ‘I form the fruit.’ Nor does the fruit think, ‘I am formed by the flower.’ Yet, if there is a seed, the sprout will take form and arise, and so on, until finally, likewise, if there is a flower, the fruit will take form and arise. Thus is the causal relation in outer dependent arising to be seen.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-37}} “So how is the conditional relation in outer dependent arising to be seen? As due to the coming together of six elements. As due to the coming together of what six elements? Namely, conditional dependent arising is to be seen as due to the coming together of the elements of earth, water, fire, wind, space, and season. {{note:{index:17,id:UT22084-062-010-38}}} The earth element functions as the support for the seed. The water element moistens the seed. The fire element ripens the seed. The wind element opens the seed. The space element performs the function of not obstructing the seed. And season transforms the seed. Without these conditions a sprout cannot form from a seed. {{page:{number:5,folio:F.118.a}}} But when the outer element of earth is not deficient, and likewise water, fire, wind, space, and season are not deficient, then from the coming together of all these factors, a sprout forms as the seed is ceasing.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-39}} “The earth element does not think, ‘I support the seed.’ Nor does the water element think, ‘I moisten the seed.’ Nor does the fire element think, ‘I ripen the seed.’ Nor does the wind element think, ‘I open the seed.’ Nor does the space element think, ‘I make sure the seed is not obstructed.’ Nor does the season think, ‘I transform the seed.’ Nor does the seed think, ‘I form the sprout.’ Nor does the sprout think, ‘I am formed by these conditions.’ Yet when these conditions are present and the seed is ceasing, the sprout forms. Likewise, when finally there is a flower, the fruit forms.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-40}} “The sprout is not created by itself, not created by another, not created by both, not created by Īśvara, not transformed by time, {{note:{index:18,id:UT22084-062-010-41}}} not derived from prakṛti , and not born without any cause. Nevertheless, through the coming together of the elements of earth, water, fire, wind, space, and season, the sprout forms as the seed is ceasing.
“Thus is the conditional relation in outer dependent arising to be seen.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-42}} “Here, outer dependent arising is to be seen in terms of five aspects. What five aspects? As not permanent, as not discontinuous, as not involving transmigration, as the production of a large result from a small cause, and as a continuity of similar type.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-43}} “How is it not permanent? It is not permanent because the sprout and the seed are different. The sprout is not the seed. {{page:{number:6,folio:F.118.b}}} The sprout does not come from the seed after it has ceased, nor does it come from the seed while it has not yet ceased. {{note:{index:19,id:UT22084-062-010-44}}} Rather, the sprout is born precisely as the seed ceases.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-45}} “How is it not discontinuous? It is not discontinuous because a sprout is not born from a seed that has already ceased, nor from a seed that has not yet ceased. Rather, like the beam of a scale tilting from up to down, a sprout is born precisely when the seed has ceased.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-46}} “How does it not involve transmigration? It does not involve transmigration because the sprout and the seed are different; that which is the sprout is not the seed.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-47}} “How does it entail the producing of a large result from a small cause? A large fruit is produced from the planting of a small seed. Therefore, it entails the producing of a large result from a small cause.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-48}} “Lastly, fruit is produced precisely according to the type of seed planted. Therefore, it involves a continuity of similar type.
“Thus is outer dependent arising to be seen in terms of five aspects.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-49}} “Similarly, inner dependent arising also arises from two principles. From what two principles? From a causal relation and a conditional relation.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-50}} “What, then, is the causal relation in inner dependent arising? It starts with ignorance causing formations and so on, until finally, birth causes aging and death. If ignorance does not arise, then formations do not manifest and so on, until finally, if birth does not arise, then aging and death do not manifest. Likewise, from the existence of ignorance, formations occur and so on, until finally, from the existence of birth, comes aging and death.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-51}} “Ignorance does not think, ‘I produce formations.’ Nor do formations think, ‘We are produced by ignorance,’ and so on. Finally, birth does not think, ‘I produce aging and death.’ Nor do aging and death think, ‘I am produced by birth.’ Nevertheless, {{page:{number:7,folio:F.119.a}}} formations take form and arise through the existence of ignorance and so on, until finally aging and death take form and arise through the existence of birth.
“Thus is the causal relation in inner dependent arising to be seen.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-52}} “How is the conditional relation in inner dependent arising to be seen? As due to the coming together of six elements. As due to the coming together of what six elements? Namely, the conditional relation in inner dependent arising is to be seen as due to the coming together of the elements of earth, water, fire, wind, space, and consciousness.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-53}} “Here, what is the earth element in inner dependent arising? That which assembles to form the solidity of the body is called the earth element. That which provides cohesion in the body is called the water element. That which digests whatever the body eats, drinks, chews, and tastes is called the fire element. That which performs the function of the body’s inhalation and exhalation is called the wind element. That which allows the body to have hollow spaces inside is called the space element. That which produces the sprouts {{note:{index:20,id:UT22084-062-010-54}}} of name and form like reeds in a sheaf—the combination of the five collections of consciousness, together with the defiled mental consciousness—is called the consciousness element. Without these conditions the body cannot be born. But when the inner earth element is not deficient, and likewise the elements of water, fire, wind, space, and consciousness are not deficient, then from the coming together of all these factors, the body forms.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-55}} “In this process, the earth element does not think, ‘I provide the solidity of the body by assembling.’ Nor does the water element think, ‘I provide cohesion for the body.’ Nor does the fire element think, ‘I digest whatever the body eats, drinks, chews, or tastes.’ {{page:{number:8,folio:F.119.b}}} Nor does the wind element think, ‘I perform the function of the body’s inhalation and exhalation.’ Nor does the space element think, ‘I create hollow spaces inside the body.’ Nor does the element of consciousness think, ‘I produce the name and form of the body.’ Nor does the body think, ‘I am produced by these conditions.’ Yet, when these conditions are present, the body is born.
{{milestone:UT22084-062-010-56}} “The earth element is not a self, not a being, not a life force, not a creature, not a human, not a person, not female, not male, not neuter, not me, not mine, and not anybody else’s.
“Similarly, the water element, the fire element, the wind element, the space element, and the consciousness element are also not a self, not a being, not a life force, not a creature, not a human, not a person, not female, not male, not neuter, not me, not mine, and not anybody else’s.

The presence of such ignorance brings desire, aversion, and delusion toward objects. Such desire, aversion, and delusion toward objects are the formations caused by ignorance. {{page:{number:9,folio:F.120.a}}} That which distinguishes between individual objects is consciousness . The four aggregates for appropriation that emerge in conjunction with consciousness, [along with the aggregate of material form], are name and form. {{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-062-010-59}}} The faculties based on name and form are the six sense sources . The conjunction of the three factors {{note:{index:23,id:UT22084-062-010-60}}} is contact . The experience of contact is sensation . Attachment to sensation is craving .
