The Noble
Prophecy of Śrī Mahādevī
{{milestone:UT22084-061-013-9}} {{page:{number:1,folio:F.246.a}}} Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.
{{page:{number:2,folio:F.246.b}}} Thus did I hear at one time. The Bhagavān was dwelling in Sukhāvatī together with the great saṅgha of bodhisattvas, amongst them the following bodhisattva mahāsattvas of the excellent eon: {{note:{index:3,id:UT22084-061-013-10}}} Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ārya Avalokiteśvara, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkaṃbhin, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Kṣitigarbha, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Vajrapāṇi and Bodhisattva Sarvabhayahara, and similarly Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarva­maṅgala­dhārin, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarva­puṇya­lakṣaṇa­dhārin, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Candra­sūrya­trailokya­dhārin, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarva­tīrtha­maṅgala­dhārin, and Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta.
{{milestone:UT22084-061-013-11}} Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara went to the place where the Bhagavān was, paid homage at the Bhagavān’s feet, and remained at one side. Śrī Mahādevī also went toward the Bhagavān, paid homage at his feet, and circumambulated him three times. Then she also paid homage to all the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who were dwelling in Sukhāvati and remained at one side. {{note:{index:4,id:UT22084-061-013-12}}} {{page:{number:3,folio:F.247.a}}}
The Bhagavān was adorned with many hundreds of thousands of merits and surrounded by as many as ten million tathāgatas. As Indra, Brahmā and the guardians of the world all offered their praises and acclaim, the Bhagavān, having gazed at Śrī Mahādevī, addressed Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara as follows in his Great Brahmā voice:
{{milestone:UT22084-061-013-13}} “Avalokiteśvara, if any one of the kings, ministers, bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, or śūdras retains this praise “The One Hundred and Eight Names {{note:{index:5,id:UT22084-061-013-14}}} of Śrī Mahādevī Which Are Renowned As Stainless,” then the kṣatriya king’s kingdom, the fears of those beings there, as well as the epidemics and harmful influences will all be pacified, {{note:{index:6,id:UT22084-061-013-15}}} and no one at all will fear robbers, rogues, humans or nonhumans. Wealth, grains, treasuries, and stores will all increase, and the Glorious Mahādevī will no doubt abide in the home of this kṣatriya king.”
{{milestone:UT22084-061-013-16}} Then those bodhisattva mahāsattvas said, “Bhagavāṇ, these words are well said. Excellent! Excellent! Those people who will retain the names of Śrī Mahādevī and who will put them into practice once they have heard them {{note:{index:7,id:UT22084-061-013-17}}} will have those aforementioned qualities and benefits.”
{{milestone:UT22084-061-013-18}} Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ārya Avalokiteśvara asked the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, where did Śrī Mahādevī generate her roots of virtue?”
{{milestone:UT22084-061-013-19}} The Bhagavān replied, “Śrī Mahādevī {{page:{number:4,folio:F.247.b}}} generated roots of virtue in the presence of tathāgatas as numerous as the grains of sand of the River Ganges. O Avalokiteśvara, previously, in the past in a world system called Ratna­saṃbhavā, the tathāgata called Ratna­kusuma­guṇa­sāgara­vaiḍūrya­kanaka­giri­suvarṇa­kāṃcana­prabhāsa­śrī came forth into the world. Śrī Mahādevī generated roots of virtue in his presence and in the presence of many other tathāgatas, too. Now, the names of the tathāgatas make Śrī Mahādevī’s roots of virtue flourish and come to fulfillment. They stay with her always, these names which here in this world Śrī Mahādevī recites precisely and which dispel all sins, eliminate all offenses, make all effects {{note:{index:8,id:UT22084-061-013-20}}} stainless, gather and increase wealth and grains, eradicate poverty, attract and catch the attention of all gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas, pacifying all epidemics, natural misfortunes, {{note:{index:9,id:UT22084-061-013-21}}} disputes, conflicts, dissensions, and arguments, and which will bring the six perfections to fulfilment. They are as follows: {{note:{index:10,id:UT22084-061-013-22}}}

{{milestone:UT22084-061-013-33}} “Now, all the tathāgatas made the following prophecies concerning Śrī Mahādevī: ‘Śrī Mahādevī, in the future you will become the tathāgata, the arhat, the truly complete buddha called Śrī­maṇi­ratna­sambhava in the world system called Śrī­mahā­ratna­pratimaṇḍitā.
