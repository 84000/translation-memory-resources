The Sūtra
Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-11}} {{page:{number:1,folio:F.63.a}}} I pay homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-12}} Thus have I heard at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in Rājagṛha, on the southern slope of Vulture Peak Mountain in the luminous grove of jewel trees, the domain of the Buddha, together with a large monastic assembly of 1,250 monks. This assembly included venerable Śāriputra, venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, venerable Mahākāśyapa, venerable Gayākāśyapa, venerable Nadīkāśyapa, venerable Ājñāta­kauṇḍinya, venerable Nandika, venerable Mahākātyāyana, venerable Bakkula, venerable Vāṣpa, venerable Koṣṭhila, venerable Vāgīśa, venerable Aśvajit, venerable Subhūti, venerable Suvāhu, venerable Aniruddha, venerable Uruvilvā­kāśyapa, venerable Revata, and venerable Ānanda, among others.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-13}} At that time, the Blessed One and his monastic assembly were venerated, revered, honored, and worshipped by Ajātaśatru, king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, who offered them clothes, food, bedding, medicine, and other material necessities. Just then, the earth shook tremendously, a massive cloud formation appeared, there was an untimely wind, strong hail began to fall, and a heavy rain fell from the massive cloud. Thunder roared and lightning flashed. Chaos erupted throughout the ten directions. A thick darkness then settled, such that the stars disappeared and even the sun and moon were dimmed. {{page:{number:2,folio:F.64.a}}} No longer gleaming and luminous, they ceased to shine.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-14}} With his pristine, divine vision, superior to that of humans, the Blessed One saw those frightening things occur in the city of Vaiśālī. He saw that villages belonging to certain Licchavi people of Vaiśālī were afflicted with elemental spirits. He saw that some of the village youth, astrologers, councilors, prime ministers, court members, servant men and women, laborers, messengers, and attendants were also afflicted with elemental spirits. He saw that the monks and nuns and the men and women with lay vows throughout the entire land of Vaiśālī were all frightened, looking up to the sky, and crying out in horror. They paid homage to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha. He saw that from among the brahmins and householders without particular devotion toward the Buddha’s teachings, some paid homage to Brahmā; some paid homage to Śakra; some paid homage to the guardians of the world; and still others paid homage to Maheśvara, Māṇibhadra, Pūrṇabhadra, Hārītī, the sun, the moon, the planets, the stars, or those spirits that dwell in mountains, forests, thickets, trees, rivers, fountains, ponds, pools, wells, and reliquaries. He saw that everyone was sitting and wondering, “How can we be freed from the peril of such a calamity?”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-15}} The Blessed One then manifested a miraculous feat by which a sound was heard throughout all realms of the trichiliocosm, causing the world of gods, humans, and demigods to have faith and assemble. {{page:{number:3,folio:F.64.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-16}} At that point, Brahmā, master of the world; the gods of the Brahma realm; Śakra, lord of the gods; the gods of the realm of the Thirty-Three; the four great kings and the gods of their realm; the twenty-eight yakṣa generals; the thirty-two great yakṣa warriors; and Hārītī with her sons, together with their retinues, all with sublime complexions, used their respective complexions and powers to bathe Vulture Peak Mountain in bright light, like a pristine dawn once the night has passed. Approaching the Blessed One, they bowed their heads to his feet, sat to one side, then praised the Blessed One in verses of unified phrasing, cadence, and meter:
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-17}} “You shine with the luster of burnished gold, Like the light of the full moon. As stable as Vaiśravaṇa, You are the source of all jewels.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-18}} Lion-Like One, with your elephant-like gait, You advance like an elephant in rut. You are like a golden mountain, Or an ornament made of gold from the Jambu River.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-19}} Like the moon in a cloudless sky Studded with stars, You are adorned with sublime characteristics In the midst of a śrāvaka assembly.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-20}} This world with its gods Comes to the Sage for refuge. The time for safeguarding The welfare of humans has neared!
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-21}} This sūtra, Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm, Disclosed by the previous buddhas, Is the supreme boundary that seals the area, All the way to the ends of the surrounding mountains.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-22}} We pay homage to you, heroic being! We pay homage to you, supreme being! To the great Sage, king of Dharma, We pay homage with palms joined!”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-23}} The Blessed One remained silent for a moment, then said to the four great kings, “Great Kings! It would be improper to think that your assembly could harm my assembly. That is because {{page:{number:4,folio:F.65.a}}} it is in this world of humans that the Buddha has appeared, the sublime Dharma has been eloquently taught, and the Saṅgha has excellently practiced it. The seed planted from this has yielded buddhas, pratyekabuddhas, arhats, and śrāvakas in the world. Based on generating the roots of virtue with respect to them, beings of the world are born into any of the thirty-two divine realms. And kings, moreover, with their four-division army, become cakra-ruling kings with dominion over the four continents. They exercise righteous rule over the entire earth all the way to the oceans. They also come to possess a thousand sons, valiant, courageous, handsome in all respects, with the impetuousness of the power of great champions, who vanquish opposing groups and take possession of the seven kinds of precious substances. Thus, you should worry little about such a thing happening in this world.”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-24}} Then, the great king Vaiśravaṇa arose from his seat, draped his upper robe on one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Bowing to the Blessed One with palms joined, he said to him, “Blessed One, we have houses, abodes, and estates, including villages, gardens, mansions, apartments, and residences scented with incense censers and strewn with flowers, with porticos, archways, and small windows. Everywhere is festooned with beautiful and bright multi-colored silk streamers and studded with bell and pearl lattice. There we dwell, surrounded by hundreds of thousands of girls, fully {{note:{index:8,id:UT22084-090-002-740}}} embroiled in the five sense pleasures. Venerable Blessed One, since we are intoxicated and thus remain without a care, our entourages venture out everywhere throughout the ten directions in search of food and drink. {{page:{number:5,folio:F.65.b}}} They thus steal life force, harm, obstruct, murder, and take the lives of men, women, boys, girls, newborns, and animals.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-25}} “We will reveal the physical characteristics of our own respective entourages before the fourfold retinue, in the presence of the Venerable Blessed One. There should be formed a magnificent image, along with a shrine, of the great king to whom a particular graha belongs. The patient should proclaim the name of that great king and scent with his own hand the image and the shrine with various fragrances. Having strewn the earth with flower petals and offered burning butter-lamps, the patient should then perform worship at that shrine.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-26}} “The symptoms of being afflicted by a yakṣa graha belonging to my entourage, Venerable Blessed One, are as follows:
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-27}} “One laughs repeatedly and trembles, Speaks incoherently, and is prone to anger. One sleeps, Or is in excruciating pain.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-28}} “One constantly looks upward, As though chasing the stars. At night one is in ecstasy, Constantly writhing and groaning.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-29}} “There are mantra syllables for this, So please listen to me, Lord of the World!

{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-30}} “ May my mantra syllables be fulfilled! May the name, power, sovereignty, and might of the great king Vaiśravaṇa bring me well-being! Svāhā!”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-31}} Next, the great king Dhṛtarāṣṭra arose from his seat, draped his upper robe on one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Bowing to the Blessed One with palms joined, he said to him, “The symptoms of being afflicted by a gandharva graha from my entourage, Blessed One, are as follows: {{page:{number:6,folio:F.66.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-32}} “One sings and dances, And also indulges in jewelry. One is without avarice and speaks profusely, Laughs, and is prone to anger.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-33}} “One is thirsty, has red eyes, And is constantly suffering with fever. Unable to open one’s eyes, One lies with face averted.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-34}} “There are mantra syllables for this, So please listen to me, Lord of the World!
syād yathedam akhe nakhe vinakhe bhandhe varāṅge capale vakhe vakhane akhiṇe nakhene vahule bhakhe bhagandale vaśe vaśavartīna svāhā |
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-35}} “ Through the name, power, sovereignty, and might of the great king Dhṛtarāṣṭra, may I be free of all grahas and misfortunes! Svāhā!”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-36}} Then it was the great king Virūḍhaka who arose from his seat, draped his upper robe on one shoulder, and kneeled on his right knee. Bowing to the Blessed One with palms joined, he said to him, “The symptoms of being afflicted by a preta kumbhāṇḍa from my entourage, Blessed One, are as follows:
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-37}} “One becomes afflicted with extreme thirst And looks about with bewilderment. One’s face turns red, And one lies curled up on the ground.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-38}} “One’s complexion becomes sickly and one’s body emaciated. One’s hair and nails grow long. One becomes filthy and malodorous. One utters falsehoods and nonsense.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-39}} “There are mantra syllables for this, So please listen to me, Lord of the World!
syād yathedam khakhakhami khalane khalami kharāli kharali karakhe kaśani karaṭe kāli kāmini vivale vidheya­śayani­samavate śama śamini svāhā  |
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-40}} “ Through the name, power, sovereignty, and might of the great king Virūḍhaka, may all grahas and misfortunes be pacified for me! Svāhā!”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-41}} The great king Virūpākṣa now arose from his seat, draped his upper robe on one shoulder, and kneeled on his right knee {{page:{number:7,folio:F.66.b}}} . Bowing to the Blessed One with palms joined, he said to him, “The symptoms of being afflicted by a fine-winged nāga graha from my entourage, Blessed One, are as follows:
“One hiccups and pants. Likewise, one’s breath becomes cold. One perspires and drools. One falls asleep repeatedly.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-42}} “Full in complexion and strong, Accordingly, one thrashes and runs about, Bares one’s finger nails, And throws oneself on the ground wailing.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-43}} “There are mantra syllables for this, So please listen to me, Lord of the World!

{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-44}} “ Through the name, power, sovereignty, and might of the great king Virūpākṣa, may I have well-being!”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-45}} At this, the Blessed One sounded a lion’s roar before the whole assembly:
“I, replete with the ten powers and emboldened by the four types of fearlessness, will perfectly roar out a great lion’s roar like the leader of the pack amid the assembly. I will turn the wheel of Brahmā.
“Only one can defeat Māra, With his sentinels, troops, and mounts! For the sake of protecting all beings, Listen to me for all incantations!
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-46}} syād yathedam asaṅge khaṅgavate balavate balanirghoṣe śūre śūravatve vajrasme vajragame vajradhare stambhe jambhe dṛḍhasāre viraje vighośe varāgraprāpte araṇe araṇe dharmmayukte diśi vighuṣṭe svāhā |
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-47}} “ May the name, power, sovereignty, and might of the Thus-Gone One bring me well-being! Svāhā!”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-48}} Once the guardians of the world in the four quarters {{page:{number:8,folio:F.67.a}}} Heard the Buddha’s speech, Frightened, petrified, and timid, They sat down with palms joined.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-49}} The gatherings of bhūtas that remained, Frightened, bewildered, and panicked, Fled throughout the ten directions, Crying out with loud wails.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-50}} Perceiving that, the great kings Proclaimed three secrets: “Wondrous! Incantation, great incantation, That destroys the great trichiliocosm!
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-51}} “Hearing this speech of the Buddha, The bhūtas have become frightened. It is like a raging fire, Or like a sword striking sesame butter.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-52}} “The incantation disclosed by Gautama Is like a razor blade. Whoever disregards That speech of the Sage, so eloquently uttered,
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-53}} “Will have his oldest son Eliminated by Brahmā’s noose. Ignite a blazing fire, Scatter the water of the burnt offering
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-54}} “Above, below, and throughout the four directions, Then take barley grains and white mustard seeds, Combined with clarified butter, And pour them into the fire.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-55}} “If, upon hearing this eloquent utterance, They do not quickly exclaim it, They will be incinerated, Like butter and white mustard seeds poured into a fire.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-56}} “Threatened with the punishment of yakṣas, They will not be well— Large boils will form On the right side of the rib cage.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-57}} “Afflicted with a yakṣa illness, They will contract white leprosy, {{note:{index:9,id:UT22084-090-002-742}}} And never travel To the palace of Aḍakavatī.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-58}} “They will not see the home Of illustrious Kubera, Nor find a seat In the company of the bhūta assemblies.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-59}} “In the circle of yakṣas, They will be without food and drink.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-60}} “Any yakṣa that does not heed This sūtra, Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm, Will incur the wrath of Vajradhara, Who will split open his forehead, Cut out his tongue With a jagged knife, Cut off his ears and nose With a sharp knife, {{page:{number:9,folio:F.67.b}}} Cut out his brains With a circular saw, And pulverize his heart With a sledgehammer. Warm pus and blood Will flow from his mouth.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-61}} “Through the punishment of the noose incantation, They will perpetually wander in saṃsāra. They will keep on cycling just there, In the cyclic existence of the yakṣa world.”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-62}} Each of the glorious great kings Then went to one of the four directions. Clad in the armor of Dharma, They sat on fine thrones.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-63}} Dhṛtarāṣṭra was in the east, Virūḍhaka in the south, Virūpākṣa in the west, And Kubera in the north.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-64}} When the great kings, Radiant with glory and splendor, had thus departed, The omniscient teacher Floated up, suspended in space.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-65}} There, on a vajra seat, In a mansion emanated by Brahmā, he took his seat. Then, Brahmā, Great Brahmā, Standing with palms joined, paid homage:
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-66}} “Glorious One, you are like a golden mountain, Or a golden sacrificial post. {{note:{index:10,id:UT22084-090-002-743}}} You are like a lotus flower in full bloom, Or the king of sal trees in blossom.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-67}} “Like the sun, or the full moon, Surrounded by stars, The Sage, with his golden complexion, Is replete with sublime characteristics.”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-68}} When Brahmā, Forefather of the World, Had thus praised the Light of the World, In front of the Lord of the World, He addressed the guardians of the world:
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-69}} “The entourages of the guardians of the world Have not received the instruction, Because from it emerge buddhas And pratyekabuddhas.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-70}} “Śrāvakas are born from it, And gods, too, are born from it. Brāhmans, who have mastered the six branches of Vedic learning, Are also born from it.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-71}} “So are distinguished sages And mendicant brāhmins. Humanity is being tormented From your lack of concern.”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-72}} When they heard Brahmā’s speech, The guardians of the world said: “It is so, Great Brahmā! It is so, Great Sage! {{page:{number:10,folio:F.68.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-73}} “We will purify all this, As far as the ocean, Shaking Mount Sumeru And overturning the earth!
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-74}} “With lasso, tight and sturdy, We will bind The sun, the moon, the winds, And all the stars!
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-75}} “We will forever eliminate Even the quarters of those Who are wicked And do the world no good.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-76}} “This world with its gods Complains on account of the bhūtas. The bhūtas harm human beings And endanger them.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-77}} “The mantra holders show That anyone who transgresses Mantras, medicines, or incantations Is defeated.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-78}} “Having threatened them thoroughly with punishment We will now speak Before the Lord of the World To our retinues that transgress the incantation.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-79}} “We will now mete out the punishment— The sūtra manifested by Brahmā— To those in the circle of bhūtas Who did not obey when it was uttered.”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-80}} They bowed to the feet of the Buddha And glanced at one another. Then, on four golden chariots, Fit for all tasks,
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-81}} With wheels with a thousand spokes, And studded with the seven types of precious substances— Beryl, gold, and silver, Pearl and crystal,
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-82}} Ruby and emerald— They miraculously took to the sky. The kings, seated there, Arrived within the circle of bhūtas.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-83}} They dispatched all the yakṣa generals To the four directions, saying: “Strew the ground With gold dust and flowers.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-84}} “Then, fasten sticks, cords, and nooses To the necks of all the bhūtas Present throughout the lands And bring them here!
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-85}} “The sublime sūtra Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm, Heard as far as the Brahma worlds, Is pondered by all gods.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-86}} “Yakṣas and rākṣasas are vanquished By the body of The Great Trichiliocosm .” {{page:{number:11,folio:F.68.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-87}} When the yakṣa generals Heard Kubera’s words, They went throughout the four directions. They called out loudly to the guhyakas:
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-88}} “O Sage! May the assemblies of bhūtas in the east, Twenty-eight bhūtas, Grahas born from gandharvas, Obey me! By means of the sūtra noose They are all bound by the five fetters! {{note:{index:11,id:UT22084-090-002-744}}}

{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-97}} “Once all the bhūtas have arrived On the mountain that destroys bhūtas, They ponder this incantation, The source of all incantations.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-98}} “Since this severely strict punishment Was uttered by all buddhas, We all respectfully Go to Gautama for refuge!
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-99}} “You should firmly obey this, And everything will vanish!”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-100}} Then, all of a sudden The assemblies of bhūtas arrived. Through the noose incantation Billions of yakṣas were summoned—

{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-249}} Finally, the divine son Maheśvara, the twenty-eight great yakṣa generals, the thirty-two great yakṣa warriors, and Hārītī with her sons, all with their entourages, each took a divine parasol, offered it to the śrāvakas, then sat, fanning them with chowries. {{page:{number:25,folio:F.75.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-250}} Having received such accolades, respect, and reverence, the Blessed One came down from Vulture Peak Mountain together with the saṅgha of monks and set out for the city of Vaiśālī. From a distance the Licchavi people of Vaiśālī saw the Blessed One coming. He was handsome and inspiring, and his senses were stilled. His mind was serene, his sense faculties were restrained, his mind was temperate, and he had attained the perfection of sublime tranquility. His sense faculties were isolated and withdrawn. He was as well trained as an elephant, and as lucid, limpid, and clear as a lake. His body was adorned with the thirty-two characteristics of a great being, and he was ornamented with the eighty fine marks. He had the body of a thus-gone one, bedecked like the king of sal trees. Like the sun, he emitted a profusion of light rays everywhere. He was like a conflagration raging atop a mountain peak in the middle of a dark night, and brilliant and shining like a golden mountain.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-251}} As soon as the Licchavi people of Vaiśālī saw the Blessed One, they gained faith in him. With faith they swept, anointed, cleansed, and strewed with flowers the path on which the Blessed One was traveling to the great city of Vaiśālī. Having decorated the road with various silk wreaths, bells, parasols, standards, and banners, and having scented it with various incenses and perfumes, they approached the Blessed One and bowed at his feet.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-252}} Then, with his stainless hand, radiating hundreds of light rays, tender and smooth, shining brighter than the rays of the sun, adorned with the signs of past virtuous conduct, as soft as the bulb of a lotus flower, and whose palm had the design of a thousand-spoked wheel, the Blessed One stroked the heads of the Licchavi people and instructed them.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-253}} Reaching the great city of Vaiśālī, the Blessed One {{page:{number:26,folio:F.76.a}}} stepped across the city threshold at midday. Looking throughout the four directions, he extended his golden arm, adjusted his upper garment, and said, “This queen of all incantations, Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm , is a Dharma teaching that liberates from all grahas. It is the seal of many buddhas, as many perfectly awakened, thus-gone arhats as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges. Any monk or nun, or any man or woman with lay vows, who in the future worships the physical relics of the Thus-Gone One, even those as small as a mustard grain, and who receives, holds, reads aloud, teaches, and masters this teaching will never be afflicted by any fever, peril, harm, epidemic, assault, strife, fight, bondage, argument, dispute, or slander. Such a person will be unaffected by the painful karma arising from non-virtuous, evil deeds. Such a person will be unaffected by any harm doers.”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-254}} Then, Brahmā, master of the world, asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Blessed One, what is the queen of secret mantras called Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm, the Dharma teaching that liberates from all grahas, the seal of the buddhas, as many perfectly awakened, thus-gone arhats as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges?”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-255}} The Blessed One answered Brahmā, master of the world, “Brahmā, listen well and keep in mind what I am going to tell you!”
“As you say, Venerable One,” responded Brahmā, master of the world, to the Blessed One, and he paid attention as the Blessed One had instructed.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-256}} The Blessed One then said to him:

{{milestone:UT22084-090-002-257}} Concerning this he continued, “Bodily mindfulness, tranquility and insight, the three absorptions, the four bases of supernatural power, the four thorough relinquishments, the four foundations of mindfulness, the four concentrations, the four truths of the noble ones, the five faculties, the five powers, the six kinds of mindfulness, the seven aspects of awakening, the eightfold path of the noble ones, the nine successive stages of meditative equipoise, the ten powers of a thus-gone one, the eleven liberated sense fields, the twelve links of dependent origination, the twelvefold wheel of Dharma, the sixteen recollections of inhaling and exhaling the breath, the eighteen unique attributes of a buddha, and the forty-two letters—all this, Brahmā, is in the queen of incantations called Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm . This is the sūtra that delivers from all grahas, the buddha seal of as many perfectly awakened, thus-gone arhats as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges.

Then, while the incantation is being recollected by a holder of the secret mantra, a knot should be tied in the cord. Next the cord should be cut with a new knife and burned. Then, the cord should be laid in a jewel or metal vessel filled with water, covered with flowers, and scented with various fragrances.
