{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-043-015-10}}} Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing at Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha together with a great assembly of one thousand two hundred fifty monks and many thousands of bodhisattvas. Included in the assembly at that time was a bodhisattva great being, a Licchavi prince from the city of Vaiśālī named Guṇaratnasaṅkusumita. The bodhisattva great being Guṇaratnasaṅkusumita rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, and knelt with his right knee on the ground. With joined palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and inquired, “If the Blessed One would grant me the opportunity to request instruction, I would like to ask a question of the honored, blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha.”
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-043-015-11}}} The Blessed One replied to the bodhisattva great being Guṇaratnasaṅkusumita, “Guṇaratnasaṅkusumita, do ask the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha whatever you wish. Then I will address your questions and set your mind at ease.”
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-043-015-12}}} The bodhisattva great being Guṇaratnasaṅkusumita then asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, are there presently blessed buddhas residing alive and well in other world systems whose names, when remembered, cause noble sons and daughters {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-043-015-112,folio:F.262.b}}} to swiftly and fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood?”
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-043-015-13}}} “Very good, Guṇaratnasaṅkusumita,” the Blessed One responded to the bodhisattva great being Guṇaratnasaṅkusumita, “very good! Guṇaratnasaṅkusumita, your motivation for asking this question of the Thus-Gone One is to benefit and bring happiness to many beings now and in the future. You have asked this question out of love for the world and to benefit, help, and bring happiness to bodhisattvas, gods, and humans. Very good, Guṇaratnasaṅkusumita! Therefore, Guṇaratnasaṅkusumita, listen well and pay attention. I will explain it to you.”
“Blessed One, I shall do that!” said the bodhisattva great being Guṇaratnasaṅkusumita, and he listened as the Blessed One had instructed.
