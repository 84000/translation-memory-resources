{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-044-004-23}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing at Jetavana, Anātha­piṇḍada’s park in Śrāvastī, together with a large assembly of five hundred bhikṣus and eight thousand bodhisattva mahāsattvas who were well versed in all fields of knowledge, had obtained retention and unimpeded eloquence, were fully accomplished in patience, were completely victorious over the hordes of Māra, and had obtained the Dharmas attained by the thus-gone ones. There was the bodhisattva Lokadhara, the bodhisattva Mārgadhara, the bodhisattva Dharaṇīdhara, the bodhisattva Mahādharaṇīdhara, the bodhisattva Dhṛtimati, the bodhisattva Adhimuktika, the bodhisattva Surūpavyūha, the bodhisattva Ratnaketu, the bodhisattva Ratnadhvaja, the bodhisattva Ratnacinta, the bodhisattva Ratnākara, the bodhisattva Ratnamati, the bodhisattva Ratnaguṇa, and the bodhisattva Ratnaprabha, and there were also the bodhisattvas of this fortunate eon headed by Maitreya. There was also a group of sixty bodhisattvas with incomparable motivation, headed by Mañjuśrī, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-044-004-341,folio:F.95.b}}} and a group of sixteen great men led by the bodhisattva Bhadrapāla. Also gathered there was an assembly of twenty thousand gods from the Tuṣita heaven.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-044-004-24}}}Then the Blessed One, who was sitting there on the lion throne called Treasury of Great Arrangements, surrounded by an immeasurable assembly of hundreds of thousands, shone forth everywhere with rays of light like those of the sun and the moon. Like the kings of the gods, Śakra and Brahmā, his brilliance was outstanding. Like Mount Meru, the king of mountains,{{note:{index:10,id:UT22084-044-004-25}}} he was extremely tall and rose high above the common. Like a great torch, the light that he radiated was utterly resplendent. Like an elephant king, he beheld each one and everyone.{{note:{index:11,id:UT22084-044-004-26}}} Like a lion roaring, he taught the Dharma fearlessly. Like the king of the asuras, Rāhula, he eclipsed all those who surrounded him.{{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-044-004-27}}} His body was adorned with all the major and minor marks of a buddha. His splendor and power blazed forth.{{note:{index:13,id:UT22084-044-004-28}}} In order to establish all sentient beings in the supreme definitive meaning and make them understand it,{{note:{index:14,id:UT22084-044-004-29}}} he was teaching the Dharma in the midst of this large audience with a voice like Brahmā’s, which resounded in all the universes of the entire trichiliocosm.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-044-004-30}}}Then King Prasenajit’s young daughter,{{note:{index:15,id:UT22084-044-004-31}}} Vimalaśraddhā—a pretty and beautiful{{note:{index:16,id:UT22084-044-004-32}}} girl whom everyone liked to see, and who had produced roots of virtue in the past and practiced in the Mahāyāna—came to Jetavana from the town of Śrāvastī, accompanied by five hundred girls, each of whom wore golden jewelry. Having prostrated herself, bowing her head to the feet of the Blessed One,{{note:{index:17,id:UT22084-044-004-33}}} she circumambulated him three times. Then, after sitting down to one side before the Blessed One, she praised him with these verses: {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-044-004-342,folio:F.96.a}}}

{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-044-004-53}}}Then the Blessed One replied to the girl Vimalaśraddhā, “Girl, if bodhisattvas are endowed with eight strengths, although dwelling within saṃsāra, they have steadfast courage and are completely indefatigable. And what are these eight strengths? The first is the strength of mental motivation, because they are without deceit. The second is the strength of determination, because they abandon all faults. The third is the strength of application, because they continually practice virtue. The fourth is the strength of real trust, because they have strong trust in the maturation of karma. The fifth is the strength of the mind set on awakening, because they do not seek out inferior vehicles. The sixth is the strength of great love, because they do not harm sentient beings. The seventh is the strength of great compassion, because they take all injury upon themselves. The eighth is the strength of a spiritual friend, because from time to time they need to be examined.{{note:{index:26,id:UT22084-044-004-54}}} Girl, these are called the eight kinds of strength. When bodhisattvas are endowed with these eight strengths,{{note:{index:27,id:UT22084-044-004-55}}} they have steadfast courage, and although they dwell within saṃsāra, they have no clinging or attachment.”
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-044-004-56}}}Then the Blessed One spoke again in verse:{{note:{index:28,id:UT22084-044-004-57}}}
“Heroic ones with motivated minds

Apply themselves diligently to genuine awakening.

What are these eight qualities? The first is the sameness of all sentient beings, because they are intrinsically without a self. The second is the sameness of all phenomena, because they are utterly void. The third is the sameness of all buddhafields, because they all occur within the sphere of emptiness. The fourth is the sameness of all thus-gone ones, because they all teach in equanimity. The fifth is the sameness of all actions, because causes and conditions are without intrinsic nature. The sixth is the sameness of all vehicles, because they are all similar in being noncomposite. {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-044-004-345,folio:F.97.b}}} The seventh is the sameness of minds, because mind is similar to an illusion. The eighth is the sameness of all māras, because one cannot observe a beginning of the afflictions. This is what is called abiding in sameness through the eight qualities.”
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-044-004-72}}}Then the Blessed One spoke again in verse:
“Because sentient beings are intrinsically without a self,
They cannot be observed even for a moment.
One who abides in sameness
Should see in this way.
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-044-004-74}}}“Because all phenomena are the same,
