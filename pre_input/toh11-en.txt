The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra
The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-119}} Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas!
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-120}} Thus have I heard on a certain occasion.
The Blessed One {{note:{index:16,id:UT22084-031-002-121}}} was residing at Vulture Peak near Rāja­gṛha with a large monastic gathering comprising many thousands of fully ordained monks. All of them were arhats who had attained the cessation of contaminants and were without afflicted mental states, fully controlled, their minds thoroughly liberated, their wisdom well liberated, thoroughbreds, mighty nāgas, their tasks accomplished, their work completed, their burdens relinquished, their own objectives already fulfilled, the fetters binding them to the rebirth process completely severed, their minds thoroughly liberated by means of genuine understanding, having perfected the highest of all mental faculties, with the exception of one person—Senior Ānanda, a disciple who had merely entered the stream. {{note:{index:17,id:UT22084-031-002-124}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-125}} Also present were some five hundred fully ordained nuns, laymen, and laywomen, all of whom had seen the truth. There were many thousands of great bodhisattva beings, all of whom had mastered the mnemonic retentions and attained the meditative stabilities, {{note:{index:18,id:UT22084-031-002-126}}} and were abiding in emptiness, their perceptual range being one of signlessness, their aspirations free from scrutiny, their tolerance endowed with equanimity, and their inspiration unimpeded. Indeed they all had the five extrasensory powers {{note:{index:19,id:UT22084-031-002-127}}} and captivating speech. Their ethical conduct was without artificiality and they had no thoughts of ulterior profit, acquisition, or fame.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-128}} They could teach the sacred doctrine, free from worldliness. They had perfected their acceptance of the profound nature of phenomena; they had acquired assurance and completely gone beyond demonic activities. Liberated from all obscurations associated with past actions, they had accumulated merits by teaching the sacred doctrine, extensively accumulating their aspirations over countless eons. Their speech was honest with a smiling demeanor, their countenances without frowns of anger. They possessed the assurance that overwhelms endless assemblies. They were skilled in their emancipation from cyclic existence, as they had demonstrated for many tens of millions of eons.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-129}} They regarded phenomena as a magical display, a mirage, a dream, the moon reflected in water, an optical aberration, empty space, an echo, a castle in the sky, or a phantom, and they were endowed with immeasurable assurance. They were skilled in comprehending the mental attitudes and interests of all sentient beings, and the knowledge that engages in subtlety. {{note:{index:20,id:UT22084-031-002-130}}} They possessed a mind with great tolerance and without animosity for any sentient being. They were skilled in definitively introducing the nature of reality. They had acquired an aspiration to be reborn in the infinite buddhafields. At all times they uninterruptedly actualized the meditative stability that recollects the buddhas of countless world systems. They were well-versed in questioning the innumerable buddhas, and skillful in rejecting afflicted mental states motivated by diverse mistaken views. They were all bodhisattvas who knew how to actualize one hundred thousand emanational displays by means of their meditative stability.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-131}} Among them were the following: {{note:{index:21,id:UT22084-031-002-132}}} the great being Bhadra­pāla, along with Ratnā­kara, Sārtha­vāha, Nara­datta, Graha­datta, {{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-031-002-133}}} Varuṇa­datta, Indra­datta, Uttara­mati, Vi­śeṣa­mati, Vardhamāna­mati, A­mogha­darśin, Su­saṃ­prasthita, Su­vikrānta­vikrāmin, Nityodyukta, Anikṣiptadhura, Sūrya­garbha, Candra­garbha, An­upama­cintin, Avalokiteśvara, Mañjuśrī, Ratna­mudrā­hasta, the bodhisattva Nityokṣipta­hasta and the great bodhisattva being Maitreya, heading many thousands of accompanying bodhisattvas, all of whom were youthful in appearance.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-134}} At that time, the Blessed One outshone Śakra, Brahmā, and all the worldly protectors. Then, in the presence of these four assemblies, he demonstrated multiple miraculous forms, vivid, brilliant and distinct, which were emanated through his magical abilities. Also, from all the pores of his body, an effulgence of light rays shone forth—many hundreds of billion trillions in number.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-137}} Thereupon, Senior Śāradvatī­putra, who was present within the assembly, observed those miraculous forms emanated through the miraculous abilities of the Tathā­gata. He was delighted. He rejoiced. His extreme joy gave rise to such delight and contentment that, rising from his seat, with his upper robe over one shoulder, he rested his right knee on the ground and placed his hands together in the gesture of homage, facing in the direction of Blessed One, while asking the Blessed One as follows: “If I might be permitted to request the Venerable Lord to pronounce on them, may I put certain questions to the Venerable Lord?”
The Blessed One then replied to Senior Śāradvatī­putra, “Śāradvatī­putra, since you always have had opportunities to question the Tathā­gata, you may ask whatever you wish, and you should be satisfied with the answers to your questions.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-138}} Senior Śāradvatī­putra then asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord, with regard to that which is called the transcendent perfection of wisdom, {{note:{index:23,id:UT22084-031-002-139}}} Venerable Lord, what exactly is the transcendent perfection of wisdom of the bodhisattvas? By perfecting what sacred doctrine do bodhisattvas perfect the transcendent perfection of wisdom and swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment?”
Thereupon, the Blessed One inspired Senior Śāradvatī­putra with the words, “Excellent, Śāradvatī­putra! Excellent! Excellent! Through the blessings of the Tathā­gata you have made a splendid request. You have had an excellent idea! To that end, you should listen carefully, keep my words in mind, and I shall teach the transcendent perfection of wisdom.”
“Venerable Lord, so be it!” he replied.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-140}} So it was that Senior Śāradvatī­putra listened to the Blessed One, and the Lord replied, “Śāradvatī­putra, that which is called the transcendent perfection of wisdom is the absence of fixation with respect to all things. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas who are without fixation perfect the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and will indeed swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-141}} Then he asked, “Venerable Lord, what are all those things on which great bodhisattva beings {{note:{index:24,id:UT22084-031-002-142}}} should not be fixated?”
The Blessed One replied, “Śāradvatī­putra, the expression ‘all things’ denotes the following: the five psycho-physical aggregates, the twelve sense fields, the eighteen sensory elements, the four noble truths, the twelve links of dependent origination, the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four supports for miraculous ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, the noble eightfold path, the emptiness that is a gateway to liberation, the signlessness that is a gateway to liberation, the aspirationlessness that is a gateway to liberation, the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable aspirations, the four formless meditative absorptions, the eight aspects of liberation, the nine serial steps of meditative equipoise, the nine contemplations of impurity, the ten recollections, the six aspects of perception, the knowledge of phenomena, the subsequent knowledge , the knowledge of other minds , the knowledge of relative appearances, the knowledge of suffering, the knowledge of the origin of suffering, the knowledge of the cessation of suffering, the knowledge of the path, the knowledge of the extinction of contaminants, the knowledge that contaminants will not be regenerated, the knowledge that is definitive, and similarly, the meditative stability endowed with ideation and scrutiny , the meditative stability free from ideation and merely endowed with scrutiny , the meditative stability free from both ideation and scrutiny , the faculties that will enable knowledge of all that is unknown, the faculties that acquire the knowledge of all things, the faculties endowed with the knowledge of all things, the eight sense fields of mastery, the ten sense fields of total consummation, the eighteen aspects of emptiness, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four assurances, the four unhindered discernments, great loving kindness, great compassion, the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, and likewise, the understanding of all phenomena, the understanding of the aspects of the path, the understanding of omniscience, the six transcendent perfections, the five extrasensory powers, {{note:{index:25,id:UT22084-031-002-143}}} the five eyes, the thirty-two major marks of a superior man, and the eighty excellent minor marks. {{note:{index:26,id:UT22084-031-002-144}}} All these are the things on which great bodhisattva beings should not be fixated. One who is without fixation perfects the transcendent perfection of wisdom and will also swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-145}} Then Senior Śāradvatī­putra asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord, what are the ‘five psycho-physical aggregates’ and likewise [those other phenomena], up to and including the ‘twelve links of dependent origination’? What are the ‘four applications of mindfulness’, and likewise [those other causal attributes] up to and including the ‘noble eightfold path’? What is the ‘emptiness that is a gateway to liberation,’ and likewise [those other attainments], up to and including ‘omniscience’? What are the ‘six transcendent perfections,’ and likewise [those other fruitional attributes], up to and including the ‘eighty minor marks’?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-146}} Thereupon, the Blessed One addressed Senior Śāradvatī­putra as follows: “Śāradvatī­putra, the ‘five psycho-physical aggregates’ comprise (1) physical forms, (2) feelings, (3) perceptions, (4) formative predispositions, and (5) consciousness.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-148}} “If you ask what are the ‘twelve sense fields,’ they comprise six that are inner and six that are outer. These are called the twelve sense fields. Among them, if you ask what are the ‘six inner sense fields,’ they comprise (1) the sense field of the eyes, (2) the sense field of the ears, (3) the sense field of the nose, (4) the sense field of the tongue, (5) the sense field of the body, and (6) the sense field of the mental faculty.

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-155}} “If you ask what are the ‘twelve links of dependent origination,’ they comprise (1) fundamental ignorance, contingent on which (2) formative predispositions arise; (3) consciousness, which arises contingent on formative predispositions; (4) name and form, which arise contingent on consciousness; (5) the six sense fields, which arise contingent on name and form; (6) sensory contact, which arises contingent on the six sense fields; (7) sensation, which arises contingent on sensory contact; (8) craving, which arises contingent on sensation; (9) grasping , which arises contingent on craving; (10) the rebirth process, which arises contingent on grasping; (11) actual birth, which arises contingent on the rebirth process; and (12) aging and death, along with sorrow, lamentation, suffering, mental discomfort, and agitation, which all arise contingent on actual birth. It is in this way that these great corporeal aggregates, exclusively endowed with suffering, arise.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-156}} “Conversely, through the cessation of fundamental ignorance, formative predispositions cease. Through the cessation of formative predispositions, consciousness ceases. Through the cessation of consciousness, name and form cease. Through the cessation of name and form, the six sense fields cease. Through the cessation of the six sense fields, sensory contact ceases. Through the cessation of sensory contact, sensation ceases. Through the cessation of sensation, craving ceases. Through the cessation of craving, grasping ceases. Through the cessation of grasping , the rebirth process ceases. Through the cessation of the rebirth process, actual birth ceases. Through the cessation of actual birth, aging and death cease; and through the cessation of aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, mental discomfort, and agitation all cease. It is in this way that these corporeal aggregates, exclusively endowed with suffering, cease.
“These two processes are respectively said to follow and reverse the sequence in which the twelve links of dependent origination arise. {{note:{index:30,id:UT22084-031-002-157}}}

(2) They achieve and maintain the second meditative concentration where there is an intense inner clarity, free from both ideation and scrutiny, the absence of ideation and scrutiny being due to one-pointed mental focus, while the joy and bliss that arise from meditative stability are present. (3) They achieve and maintain the third meditative concentration where joy is absent, abiding in equanimity due to the absence of attachment to joy, while both mindfulness and alertness are present and bliss is experienced by the body. This is what sublime beings describe as ‘mindful, blissful, abiding in bliss, and equanimous.’ (4) They achieve and maintain the fourth meditative concentration where even that sense of bliss is abandoned and former states of suffering have also been eliminated. Here, neither suffering nor bliss is present because blissful and unhappy states of mind have both subsided, while equanimity and mindfulness are utterly pure. These are called the four meditative concentrations. {{note:{index:33,id:UT22084-031-002-171}}}

(2) The second aspect of liberation ensues when formless beings endowed with internal perception observe external physical forms. (3) The third aspect of liberation ensues when beings are inclined toward pleasant states. (4) The fourth aspect of liberation ensues when the perceptions of physical forms have been completely transcended in all respects, when the perceptions of obstructed phenomena have subsided, and the mind does not engage with diverse perceptions, so that one achieves and abides in the sense field of infinite space, thinking, ‘Space is infinite.’ (5) The fifth aspect of liberation ensues when the sense field of infinite space has been completely transcended in all respects, and when one achieves and abides in the sense field of infinite consciousness, thinking, ‘Consciousness is infinite.’ (6) The sixth aspect of liberation ensues when the sense field of infinite consciousness has been completely transcended in all respects, and one achieves and abides in the sense field of nothing-at-all, thinking, ‘There is nothing at all.’ (7) The seventh aspect of liberation ensues when the sense field of nothing-at-all has been completely transcended in all respects, and one achieves and abides in the sense field of neither perception nor non-perception.

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-433}} Then he asked, “Lord, what what views might great bodhisattva beings adopt with respect to all things?”
The Blessed One replied, “Śāradvatī­putra, there are views which concern the psycho-physical aggregates, the sensory elements, the sense fields, the noble truths, and dependent origination. Similarly, there are views concerning the applications of mindfulness, the correct exertions, the supports for miraculous ability, the faculties, the powers, the branches of enlightenment, the noble eightfold path, and liberation. Similarly, there are views concerning the meditative concentrations, the immeasurable aspirations, and the formless absorptions. Similarly, there is a view concerning the contemplations [of impurity], a view concerning the recollections, a view concerning the aspects of perception, a view concerning the modes of knowledge, a view concerning the meditative stabilities, a view concerning the faculties, a view concerning the sense fields of mastery, and a view concerning the aspects of emptiness. Similarly, there are views concerning the ten powers of a tathāgata, the assurances, the unhindered discernments, great loving kindness, great compassion, the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, the understanding of all phenomena, the understanding of the aspects of the path, [and omniscience]. Similarly, there is a view concerning the transcendent perfections, a view concerning the extrasensory powers, a view concerning the eyes, {{note:{index:141,id:UT22084-031-002-434}}} a view concerning the major marks, and a view concerning the minor marks. Śāradvatī­putra, these are the views that great bodhisattva beings might adopt, with respect to all things.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-435}} Then he asked, “Lord, what are the deluded mindsets that great bodhisattva beings might have with respect to all things?”
The Blessed One replied, “Śāradvatī­putra, with regard to [those phenomena] that commence from the five psycho-physical aggregates and extend as far as the link [of dependent origination known as] aging and death, and likewise with regard to those commencing from the four applications of mindfulness and extending as far as the noble eightfold path, and likewise with regard to those commencing from the three gateways to liberation and extending as far as the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities, and likewise with regard to those commencing from the ten powers of the tathāgatas and extending as far as omniscience, and likewise with regard to those commencing from the six transcendent perfections and extending as far as the eighty minor marks—when one views them as permanent or impermanent, as conducive to happiness or suffering, as a self or not a self, empty or not empty, with signs or signless, having aspirations or without aspirations, calm or not calm, void or not void, afflicted or purified, arising or not arising, ceasing or not ceasing, and as entities or non-entities, and when one apprehends, defines, and engages in ideation and scrutiny with respect to them, that is called the deluded mind which great bodhisattva beings might have with respect to all things.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-436}} “Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, whenever a great bodhisattva being holds the view that these are virtuous phenomena, these are non-virtuous phenomena, these are specific phenomena, these are non-specific phenomena, these are mundane phenomena, these are supramundane phenomena, these are contaminated phenomena, these are uncontaminated phenomena, these are conditioned phenomena, these are unconditioned phenomena, these are common phenomena, or these are uncommon phenomena, and then apprehends, defines, and engages in ideation and scrutiny with respect to them, that, Śāradvatī­putra, is called the deluded mind which great bodhisattva beings might have with respect to all things. If you ask why, it is because there are no sentient beings, because sentient beings are non-apprehensible, because sentient beings are non-arising, because sentient beings are unceasing, and because sentient beings are in fact emptiness. The same goes for living organisms, lives, living creatures, individuals, humankind, human beings, actors, creators, petitioners, instigators, experiencers, experiencing subjects, and knowers, {{note:{index:142,id:UT22084-031-002-437}}} because they are not perceived, because they are non-apprehensible, because they are non-arising, because they are unceasing, and because they are in fact emptiness.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-438}} “Indeed, all phenomena are non-arising, unceasing, empty, unmoving, vacuous, without a self, non-originated, uncreated, unconditioned, and without creator or actor.

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-440}} “Śāradvatī­putra! With regard to those things, which are merely names, are there any that are absolutely existent?”
“There are none, Lord!” he replied.

“Yes it would, Lord!” he replied.

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-948}} Senior Śāradvatī­putra then asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! Just as there are no changes and no conceptual notions regarding the actual mind, then are there no changes and no conceptual notions regarding actual physical forms, feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness? In the same vein, are there no changes and no conceptual notions regarding any [phenomena] at all, up to and including all formative predispositions? If that were the case, there would be no changes and no conceptual notions regarding all [attributes and attainments]. up to and including enlightenment.”
The Blessed One replied, “Śāradvatī­putra, that is right! There are no changes and no conceptual notions regarding any mind. There are no changes and there are no conceptual notions regarding any [phenomena], up to and including all formative predispositions, and similarly regarding [all the attributes and attainments], up to and including enlightenment. Śāradvatī­putra, this absence of change and absence of conceptual notions regarding all things is designated as the maturity of a great bodhisattva being who practices the transcendent perfection of wisdom.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-949}} “Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, the maturity of a great bodhisattva being also entails the four applications of mindfulness which are correctly retained by skill in means. If you ask what these four are, they may be described as follows:
(1) Great bodhisattva beings who are diligent, alert, and mindful, after eliminating worldly covetousness and sadness without apprehending anything, with regard to the inner body, continue to observe the physical body, without generating any apperceptions dependent on the physical body. Similarly, those who are diligent, alert, and mindful, after eliminating worldly covetousness and sadness without apprehending anything, with regard to the outer body, continue to observe the physical body, without generating any apperceptions dependent on the physical body. Similarly, those who are diligent, alert, and mindful, after eliminating worldly covetousness and sadness without apprehending anything, with regard to the inner and outer body combined, continue to observe the physical body, without generating any apperceptions dependent on the physical body.

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-952}} (3) Those who are diligent, alert, and mindful, after eliminating worldly covetousness and sadness without apprehending anything, with regard to the inner mind, the outer mind, and the combined inner and outer mind, continue to observe the mind, without generating any apperceptions dependent on the mind.

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-954}} “Śāradvatī­putra, if you ask how, with regard to the inner body, great bodhisattva beings continue to observe the physical body, when great bodhisattva beings are engaged in conduct, they are fully aware that they are engaged in conduct. When they are standing upright, they are fully aware that they are standing upright. When they are sitting, they are fully aware that they are sitting. When they are lying down, they are fully aware that they are lying down. In whatever ways the body changes its posture, they are fully aware of these. Śāradvatī­putra, it is in such ways that great bodhisattva beings who are diligent, alert and mindful, after eliminating worldly covetousness and sadness without apprehending anything, with regard to the inner body, continue to observe the physical body.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-955}} “Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, great bodhisattva beings maintain alertness whether they are going out or returning back. They maintain alertness whether they are looking outwardly or looking introspectively. They maintain alertness whether they are bending or stretching their limbs; whether they are holding an outer patched robe, a waist cloth, or an alms bowl; and whether they are eating, drinking, chewing, tasting, waking up, resting, coming or going, [standing or] sitting, reclining or not reclining, and speaking or not speaking. They maintain alertness whether they are absorbed in meditation or arising from meditation.

They are fully aware that when they inhale a short breath, they are inhaling a short breath, and that when they exhale a short breath, they are exhaling a short breath. Śāradvatī­putra, this resembles, for example, a potter or the skilled apprentice of a potter who is fully aware that when he is turning the wheel in a long whirl, he is turning the wheel in a long whirl, and who is fully aware that when he is turning the wheel in a short whirl, he is turning the wheel in a short whirl. Likewise, Śāradvatī­putra, great bodhisattva beings breathe in mindfully and breathe out mindfully. When they are inhaling a long breath, they are fully aware that they are inhaling a long breath. When they are exhaling a long breath, they are fully aware that they are exhaling a long breath. When they are inhaling a short breath, they are fully aware that they are inhaling a short breath.

They then achieve and maintain the second meditative concentration, where there is an intense inner clarity, free from both ideation and scrutiny—the absence of ideation and scrutiny being due to one-pointed mental focus, while the joy and bliss that arise from meditative stability are present. They then achieve and maintain the third meditative concentration, where bliss remains but joy is absent due to the absence of attachment to joy—this is what sublime beings describe as ‘equanimous, mindful, and pure’. And they then achieve and maintain the fourth meditative concentration where even that sense of bliss is abandoned, and neither suffering nor bliss is present because blissful and unhappy states of mind have both previously subsided, while equanimity and mindfulness are utterly pure.

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1051}} “Śāradvatī­putra, those great bodhisattva beings who have become liberal donors bequeath food to virtuous ascetics, brāhmins, the destitute, wandering mendicants, forest-dwelling anchorites, and to beggars who are in need of food. They offer drink to those in need of drink, and in the same vein, they donate clothing, incense, garlands, unguents, bedding, mats, and homes to those who are in need of them. They donate lodgings to those who are in need of lodgings, they offer medicines to those in need of medicine, they offer provisions to those in need of provisions; and similarly, they offer appropriate human resources to beggars, and likewise, they offer their sons, they offer their daughters, they offer their wives and courtesans; and similarly, they offer their heads, eyes, ears, nose, marrow, hands, limbs, and appendages. In doing so, they practice liberality while adhering to the ownership of property, thinking, ‘I am giving. They are receiving. O! I am without miserliness. I am a donor. I give alms. O! I give everything. I respect the lord buddhas. I practice the transcendent perfection of generosity. I, having given this gift, dedicate it for the sake of unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, making common cause with all sentient beings, and without apprehending anything! Through this, my gift, may all sentient beings attain happiness in this lifetime! May they attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of reality that is beyond sorrow, and where there is no residue of the psycho-physical aggregates!’ However, in giving their gifts they are tied by three fetters. What, you may ask, are the three? They comprise the notion of self, the notion of others, and the notion of the act of giving. This act of giving gifts, when tied by these three fetters, Śāradvatī­putra, is called the transcendent perfection of mundane generosity. If you ask why it is called the transcendent perfection of mundane generosity, it is because those who practice in such mundane ways do not move beyond and transcend the mundane. For that reason, it is designated as ‘mundane.’
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1052}} “What, you may ask, is the supramundane transcendent perfection of generosity? It is the purity of the three spheres [of subject, object, and their interaction]. In this context, the mind that is preceded by the great compassion of great bodhisattva beings does not apprehend the dispensing of gifts. It does not apprehend the giver, nor does it apprehend the recipient. This absence of giving and the absence of rejoicing in the ripening impact of giving, Śāradvatī­putra, is called the purity of the three spheres [of subject, object, and their interaction].
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1053}} “Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, great bodhisattva beings offer gifts to all sentient beings, and even after making their gifts, they practice liberality toward those same beings, but they do not apprehend those sentient beings. They do not consider the recipient. They do not even rejoice in the ripening impact of their giving. Although they also dedicate their gifts for the sake of unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, they do not consider even the slightest indication [of anything]. This, Śāradvatī­putra, is called the transcendent perfection of supramundane generosity. If you ask why it is called the transcendent perfection of supramundane generosity, it is because it goes beyond the mundane, it is superior to the mundane, and transcends the mundane. [For that reason], it is called the transcendent perfection of supramundane generosity.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1054}} “In the same vein, the abiding mode of the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline is mundane, and its non-abiding mode is supramundane. What has already been said for the transcendent perfection of generosity should be fully applied here, and also for the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of perseverance, and the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration. The abiding mode of the transcendent perfection of wisdom is mundane, and its non-abiding mode is supramundane.
“Śāradvatī­putra, just as great bodhisattva beings perfect the mundane and supramundane transcendent perfection of generosity, so it is that they perfect the other transcendent perfections, up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom. This indeed, Śāradvatī­putra, is the Great Vehicle of great bodhisattva beings, their great armor, and the maturity of the bodhisattvas.”

The Blessed One then addressed Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings should don the armor of the transcendent perfection of generosity, and similarly, they should don the armor of the other transcendent perfections, up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom. They should don the armor of the applications of mindfulness, and don the armor of [the other causal attributes], up to and including the noble eightfold path. They should don the armor of the emptiness of internal phenomena, and don the armor of the other aspects of emptiness, up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities. Similarly, they should don the armor of the ten powers of the tathāgatas, and they should don the armor of the [other fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. They should don the armor of [the attainments], up to and including omniscience. They should don the armor of the buddha body. Then they will illuminate the world system of the great trichiliocosm.

Similarly, they illuminate the world systems of the other directions, up to and including the intermediate directions, numerous as the sands of the River Ganges. Having permeated [all directions with light], they cause the world systems of the great trichiliocosm to shake, to shake more intensely, and to shake with utmost intensity, and in six ways. {{note:{index:184,id:UT22084-031-002-1059}}} In the same manner, they cause the chiliocosm, extending from the eastern direction up to and including the intermediate directions, numerous as the sands of the River Ganges, to shake, to shake more intensely, and to shake with utmost intensity, and in six ways.

In the same vein, they dispense other benefits to sentient beings, including appropriate human resources, and having made such gifts, they then teach sentient beings the sacred doctrine that is endowed with the six transcendent perfections. Those sentient beings, too, on hearing sacred doctrine, will never commit transgressions, and will never be separated from the six transcendent perfections until they have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment. Su­bhūti, it is to that extent that great bodhisattva beings are said to don the great armor.

Dwelling as mighty lords in the family of a universal monarch, they will establish sentient beings, many hundreds of billion trillions in number, on the path of the ten virtuous actions. Likewise, they will establish them in the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable aspirations, and the four formless absorptions.

The Venerable Lord replied, “Śāradvatī­putra, when great bodhisattva beings train accordingly, they do train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom. In doing so, they train without apprehending anything. It is in the same manner that they train in the [other transcendent perfections], from the transcendent perfection of generosity onwards. In the same vein, when they train accordingly, they also train in the [causal attributes], from the applications of mindfulness onwards, and when they train accordingly, they also train in the [fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. In doing so, they train without apprehending anything.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1246}} Then, Senior Śāradvatī­putra asked the Venerable Lord, “Venerable Lord, so is it the case that when great bodhisattva beings train accordingly, they train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and in doing so, that they train without apprehending anything?”
The Venerable Lord replied, “Śāradvatī­putra, when great bodhisattva beings train accordingly, they do indeed train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom, without apprehending anything.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1247}} Then he asked, “Venerable Lord, what is it that they do not apprehend?”
The Venerable Lord replied, “Owing to the utter purity of all things, they do not apprehend a self. They do not apprehend sentient beings, and so on. They do not apprehend knowers and viewers. Similarly, owing to the utter purity of all things, they do not apprehend the psycho-physical aggregates. They do not apprehend the sensory elements. They do not apprehend the sense fields. Owing to the utter purity of all things, they do not apprehend fundamental ignorance, and they do not apprehend [the other links of dependent origination], up to and including aging and death. Similarly, owing to the utter purity of all things, they do not apprehend [the truth of] suffering. Nor do they apprehend [the truths of] the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path that leads to it. Similarly, owing to the utter purity of all things, they do not apprehend the world system of desire; nor do they apprehend the world system of form and nor do they apprehend the world system of formlessness. Similarly, owing to the utter purity of all things, they do not apprehend the applications of mindfulness, and they do not apprehend [the other causal attributes], up to and including the noble eightfold path. Similarly, owing to the utter purity of all things, they do not apprehend the ten powers of the tathāgatas, and they do not apprehend [the other fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. Owing to the utter purity of all things, they do not apprehend the six transcendent perfections. Owing to the utter purity of all things, they do not apprehend those entering the stream. Owing to the utter purity of all things, they do not apprehend those who are tied to one more rebirth, those who will not be reborn, and those who have attained arhatship. Owing to the utter purity of all things, they do not apprehend pratyekabuddhas. Owing to the utter purity of all things, they do not apprehend bodhisattvas. Owing to the utter purity of all things, they do not apprehend tathāgatas.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1248}} Then Senior Śāradvatī­putra asked the Venerable Lord, “Venerable Lord, what is that purity?”
The Blessed One replied, “Purity indicates that all things are non-arising. Similarly, they are unceasing. They are neither afflicted nor are they purified. They do not arise, and they are without apprehension—all things are unconditioned.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1249}} “Venerable Lord, when great bodhisattva beings train accordingly, in what things do they train?”
The Blessed One replied, “Śāradvatī­putra, when great bodhisattva beings train accordingly, they do not train in anything at all. If you ask why, Śāradvatī­putra, it is because these things are non-existent in the ways that ordinary people are fixated on them.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1250}} “Venerable Lord, how is it that these things are non-existent in the ways that ordinary people are fixated on them?”
The Blessed One replied, “They exist to the extent that they do not exist, and accordingly, since they do not exist, [their posited existence] is called fundamental ignorance.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1251}} “Venerable Lord,” he asked, “why are these things that do not exist called fundamental ignorance?”
The Blessed One replied, “Śāradvatī­putra, it is owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena, and to the other aspects of emptiness, up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities, that physical forms are non-existent. Similarly, it is owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena, and to the other aspects of emptiness, up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities, that feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness are non-existent. Similarly, it is owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena, and to the other aspects of emptiness, up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities, that the applications of mindfulness are non-existent, and non-apprehensible. In the same vein, it is owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena, and to the other aspects of emptiness, up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities, that [the other causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, are non-existent. However, ordinary people, through their fixations due to fundamental ignorance and craving, become fixated and impute that which is non-existent as existent. Through their adherence to the two extremes of eternalism and nihilism, without knowing and without seeing, they imagine those things that are non-existent, and after imputing them, they become fixated on the [psycho-physical aggregates that constitute] name and form. In the same vein, they become fixated on [all the causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. Since, owing to their fixation on these things, they imagine things that are non-existent, they do not know and they do not see. If you ask what they do not know and do not see, they neither know nor see physical forms. Similarly, they neither know nor see feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness; in the same vein, they neither know nor see [the causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. It is precisely because they neither know nor see that they come to be styled ‘ordinary people.’
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1252}} “These people will not attain emancipation, and if you ask what it is that they will not be emancipated from, they will not be emancipated from the world system of desire. Similarly, they will not be emancipated from the world system of form or the world system of formlessness. They will not be emancipated into the doctrines of the śrāvakas or the pratyekabuddhas. They will not be emancipated into the doctrines of the bodhisattvas. They will not be emancipated into the doctrines of the genuinely perfect buddhas. They lack convictions. They lack the conviction that physical forms are emptiness. {{note:{index:262,id:UT22084-031-002-1253}}} Similarly, they lack the convictions that feelings are emptiness, that perceptions are emptiness, that formative predispositions are emptiness, that consciousness is emptiness, and so on, up to and including the fruitional attributes. Also, they are not stable. If you ask what it is in which they are not stable, they are not stable in the transcendent perfection of generosity. They are not stable in the other transcendent perfections, up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom. They are not stable in the irreversible [sublime] levels, and they are not stable in [the causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. For that reason, they are called ‘ordinary people,’ and they are said to be ‘fixated.’ If you ask what is their fixation, and on what they are fixated, they are fixated on physical forms, and they are fixated on [the other aggregates], including consciousness. Similarly, they are fixated on the eyes, and in the same manner they are fixated on [the other sense organs], including the mental faculty. They are fixated on sights, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental phenomena. Similarly, they are fixated on the sensory elements. They are fixated on desire, hatred, and delusion. They are fixated on opinions.

The Blessed One replied, “Śāradvatī­putra, the bodhisattvas who train accordingly do not train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and they will not attain emancipation in omniscience.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1255}} “Venerable Lord, how is that so?”
The Blessed One replied, “Śāradvatī­putra, great bodhisattva beings who are unskillful conceive of and become fixated on the transcendent perfection of wisdom. Similarly, they conceive of and become fixated on the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration, the transcendent perfection of perseverance, the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, and the transcendent perfection of generosity. In the same vein, they conceive of and become fixated on [the other causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. Having become fixated, they conceive of the understanding of all things, and of omniscience, and it is after imagining these that they become fixated on omniscience. Śāradvatī­putra, for these reasons bodhisattvas do not train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and they will not attain emancipation in the state of omniscience.”

The Blessed One replied, “Śāradvatī­putra, when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom do not consider the nature of the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and, Śāradvatī­putra, when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom in that manner, they train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom without apprehending anything and attain emancipation in omniscience.

In the same vein, when they practice the other transcendent perfections, up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom, they do not apprehend the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and so forth. They do not apprehend [the causal attributes], up to and including enlightenment. They do not apprehend [the fruitional attributes], up to and including omniscience. Śāradvatī­putra, when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom in that manner, it is owing to their non-apprehension that they train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom and will attain emancipation in omniscience.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1258}} “Venerable Lord,” he asked, “with respect to what will they attain emancipation owing to their non-apprehension?”
The Blessed One replied, “They will attain emancipation owing to their non-apprehension of the emptiness of internal phenomena, and in the same vein, owing to their non-apprehension of the other aspects of emptiness, up to and including the emptiness of all things.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1259}} Then, Senior Su­bhūti asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! From what will emancipation be attained by means of this vehicle, and where will this vehicle come to rest?”
The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, emancipation will be attained from the three world systems, and consequently emancipation will be attained in omniscience. It will come to rest therein, and it will do so owing to non-duality. If you ask why, it is because the doctrine of the Great Vehicle and the doctrine which is omniscience are neither conjoined, nor disjoined. They share a single defining characteristic in that they are immaterial, unrevealed, unimpeded, and without defining characteristics.

Similarly, one who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in the inconceivable expanse. One who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in spiritual attainment and [consequent] happiness. One who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in the element of exertion. In the same vein, one who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in the element of dispassion, the element of cessation, and the emptiness of physical forms, and similarly, merely wishes to attain emancipation in the emptiness of feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness.

Similarly, the emptiness of feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness will not attain emancipation from the three world systems, and it will not come to rest in omniscience.

Similarly, it should be extensively applied to [all the other attributes and attainments] as well, up to and including omniscience.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1394}} “For these reasons, Senior Śāradvatī­putra, the imperishability of physical forms is not physical forms. Similarly, the imperishability of feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness is not consciousness [and the other aggregates]. Similarly, the imperishability of [all attributes and attainments], up to and including omniscience, is not omniscience [and the rest].”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1395}} Then, Senior Śāradvatī­putra addressed Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Senior Su­bhūti, why do you say that that which is termed ‘physical forms’ is to be counted as imperishable? In the same vein, why do you say that [all attributes and attainments], up to and including that which is termed ‘omniscience,’ are to be counted as imperishable?” {{note:{index:280,id:UT22084-031-002-1396}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1397}} Senior Su­bhūti replied to Senior Śāradvatī­putra, “Physical forms are not one thing, and non-arising another. The nature of non-arising is indeed physical forms. The nature of physical forms is indeed non-arising. Similarly, feelings, too, are not one thing, perceptions are not one thing, formative predispositions are not one thing, consciousness is not one thing, and non-arising another, [distinct from these]. The nature of consciousness is indeed non-arising. The nature of non-arising is indeed consciousness. For these reasons, Senior Śāradvatī­putra, that which is termed ‘physical forms’ is to be counted as imperishable. Similarly, that which is termed ‘feelings,’ ‘perceptions,’ and ‘formative predispositions,’ and that which is termed ‘consciousness’ are to be counted as imperishable.

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1399}} Then Senior Su­bhūti said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! Furthermore, when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom are engaged in the investigation of these phenomena, owing to their utter purity they do consider the non-arising of physical forms. Similarly, owing to their utter purity, they do consider the non-arising of feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness. Similarly, owing to their utter purity, they do consider the non-arising of a self.

Owing to their utter purity, they do consider the non-arising of the genuinely perfect buddhas.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1400}} Then Senior Śāradvatī­putra addressed Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Senior Su­bhūti, as I understand the meaning of your words, physical forms are non-arising. Similarly, feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness are non-arising. In the same vein, [all attributes], up to and including enlightenment, are non-arising. Even the attributes of the buddhas are non-arising. If that were so, those who enter the stream would already have attained the fruit of entering the stream, and also arhats would have already attained arhatship. Similarly, those who follow the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas would have already attained their individual enlightenment. Also, great bodhisattva beings would have absolutely attained omniscience. The five classes of living beings would not even be differentiated. Great bodhisattva beings would have absolutely attained the five degrees of enlightenment, even though they are without insight. {{note:{index:281,id:UT22084-031-002-1401}}}

Why should those who seek the fruit of arhatship cultivate the path in order to abandon the five fetters associated with the higher realms? {{note:{index:283,id:UT22084-031-002-1405}}} Why should [pratyekabuddhas] cultivate the path of individual enlightenment, according to which all formative predispositions are dependently originated? Again, why should great bodhisattva beings practice austerity and undergo myriad sufferings for the sake of sentient beings? Why should the tathāgatas attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment? Why should the tathāgatas turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine?”
Senior Su­bhūti then replied to Senior Śāradvatī­putra as follows: “Senior Śāradvatī­putra, I do not hold that [attainments] are designated with respect to things that are non-arising. {{note:{index:284,id:UT22084-031-002-1406}}} I do not hold that stream-entry and the fruit of stream-entry are found in non-arising.

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1407}} “Senior Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas do not engage in the practice of austerity with the perception of hardship. If you ask why, Senior Śāradvatī­putra, it is because when the perception of hardship is developed, it will not be possible to act for the benefit of innumerable, countless sentient beings. On the contrary, Senior Śāradvatī­putra, once great bodhisattva beings have developed, without apprehending anything, the perception of sentient beings as their father, the perception [of sentient beings] as their mother, the perception [of sentient beings] as their child, and the perception [of sentient beings] as themselves, they should develop the mind of unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. Just as the notion of individual selves is entirely non-existent in all respects and is non-apprehensible, in that same manner they should develop this perception with regard to all inner and outer phenomena. If they develop their perceptions in that manner, the notion of hardship will not arise. If you ask why, it is because, in all respects, in each and every way, they neither acquire nor do they apprehend all these phenomena.

There is nothing at all that will be attained on the basis of things that are non-arising.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1409}} Then, Senior Śāradvatī­putra addressed Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Senior Su­bhūti, do you hold that attainment will ensue on the basis of things that are non-arising, or else do you hold that something will be attained on the basis of things that are arising?”
“Senior Śāradvatī­putra, I do not hold that attainment will ensue on the basis of things that are non-arising nor do I hold that anything will be attained on the basis of things that are arising.”

“Senior Śāradvatī­putra, there is attainment and there is clear realization, but not in terms of duality. Yet, Senior Śāradvatī­putra, attainment and clear realization refer to worldly conventions. Similarly, those who enter the stream are also designated according to worldly convention. Similarly, [the other realized beings], including arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and the unsurpassed, genuinely perfect buddhas, too, are designated on the basis of worldly convention. But, ultimately, there is no attainment. There is no clear realization either, and there are no [realized beings], up to and including genuinely perfect buddhas.”

“Senior Śāradvatī­putra, that is so! Just as attainment and clear realization are exclusively designated according to worldly convention, it is the case that the five classes of living beings also are differentiated owing to worldly convention but not in ultimate reality. If you ask why, Senior Śāradvatī­putra, in ultimate reality there are no past actions, no ripening, no affliction, and no purification.”

“Senior Śāradvatī­putra, arising does not arise, nor does non-arising arise. If you ask why, Senior Śāradvatī­putra, it is because both things that arise and things that are non-arising are neither conjoined nor disjoined, and they share a single defining characteristic in that they are all immaterial, unrevealed, unimpeded, and without defining characteristics. For these reasons, Senior Śāradvatī­putra, arising does not arise, nor does non-arising arise.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1416}} Then Senior Śāradvatī­putra addressed Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Senior Su­bhūti, are you inspired to say that things are non-arising, that things are indeed non-arising?

“Senior Śāradvatī­putra, it is so! It is just as you have spoken! These things are indeed non-arising. The act of inspiration too is non-arising. Those statements too are non-arising, and the things that I was inspired to say, commencing therefrom, are also non-arising!

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1528}} Then Senior Śāradvatī­putra said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom sheds light owing to its utter purity. Venerable Lord! I pay homage to the transcendent perfection of wisdom. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom is unsullied by the three world systems. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom dispels the blindness of afflicted mental states and all false views. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom has precedence over all branches of enlightenment. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom secures happiness, distinct from all fears, enmity, and harmful [thoughts or deeds]. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom brings light to all sentient beings so that they might acquire the [five] eyes. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom demonstrates the path to those who are going astray so that they might abandon the two extremes. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom is omniscience, so that all afflicted mental states and involuntary reincarnation through propensities might be abandoned. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom is the mother of the bodhisattvas because it generates all the attributes of the buddhas. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom is neither produced, nor does it disintegrate, because it is empty of intrinsic defining characteristics. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom abandons cyclic existences because it is neither an enduring state, nor is it perishable. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom offers protection to those who lack protection because it bestows all that is precious. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom is endowed with the completely perfect [ten] powers {{note:{index:302,id:UT22084-031-002-1529}}} because it cannot be crushed by any antagonists. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom turns the wheel of the sacred doctrine, repeating it in the three times and in its twelve aspects, {{note:{index:303,id:UT22084-031-002-1530}}} because it is neither subject to promulgation nor reversal. Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom genuinely displays the essential nature of all things because it is the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities. Venerable Lord! How can bodhisattvas, those who are on the vehicle of the bodhisattvas, those who are on the vehicle of the śrāvakas, or those who are on the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas abide in the transcendent perfection of wisdom?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1531}} The Blessed One replied, “Śāradvatī­putra! Just as they abide alongside the Teacher, and just as they pay homage to the Teacher, so they should do the same with respect to the transcendent perfection of wisdom. If you ask why, Śāradvatī­putra, it is because this transcendent perfection of wisdom is itself the Teacher. The Teacher is not one thing, and the transcendent perfection of wisdom another. Rather, emptiness is the transcendent perfection of wisdom and the nature of the transcendent perfection of wisdom is empty. It is owing to this transcendent perfection of wisdom that the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas are distinguished, and similarly that the bodhisattvas, the pratyekabuddhas, the arhats, and in the same vein, [all those of spiritual attainment, down to and including those who have entered the stream to nirvāṇa] are distinguished. It is owing to this transcendent perfection of wisdom that the paths of the ten virtuous actions are distinguished in the world and similarly, that the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable aspirations, the four formless absorptions, the five extrasensory powers, the transcendent perfection of generosity and the other transcendent perfections, up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and the emptiness of internal phenomena along with the other aspects of emptiness, up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities, are distinguished in the world. Similarly, it is owing to this transcendent perfection of wisdom that the ten powers of the tathāgatas are distinguished, along with [the other fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, and that [the other attainments], up to and including omniscience, are distinguished.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1532}} Thereupon, Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, thought, “What is the basis of this question that Senior Śāradvatī­putra has asked? What is its context?”
Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, then asked Senior Śāradvatī­putra, “Venerable Śāradvatī­putra! What is the basis of this question that you have asked? What is its context?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1533}} Senior Śāradvatī­putra replied to Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, “Kauśika, great bodhisattva beings who have acquired the transcendent perfection of wisdom, owing to their skillful means, have concentrated and subsumed the roots of virtue possessed by the lord buddhas of the past, future, and present, commencing from when they first began to set their mind on enlightenment and lasting as long as the sacred doctrine itself endures, as well as the roots of virtue possessed by the Lord Buddha, along with his monastic community of śrāvakas, and those of the pratyekabuddhas, and the roots of virtue possessed by all other sentient beings apart from them, who are engaged in the Great Vehicle. Making common cause with all sentient beings, they then dedicate these [roots of virtue] for the sake of unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. So this was the basis of the question I asked.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1534}} “Moreover, Kauśika, the transcendent perfection of wisdom possessed by great bodhisattva beings dominates the transcendent perfection of generosity. Similarly, it dominates the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of perseverance, and the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration. Kauśika, just as those who are born blind, whether they number a hundred, a thousand, or a hundred thousand, cannot set out on a road, or enter a hamlet, town, city, or country without a guide, and they are incapable and inadequate, having no way to move, in the same way, Kauśika, the five [lower] transcendent perfections resemble one who is born blind. Unguided by the transcendent perfection of wisdom, all of them will be separated from the transcendent perfection of wisdom so that they will have no opportunity to set out on the paths associated with perfect enlightenment, from one to the next, or to enter the citadel of omniscience. However, Kauśika, when the five [lower] transcendent perfections, starting with the transcendent perfection of generosity, have been acquired through the transcendent perfection of wisdom, these five transcendent perfections will be endowed with vision. Indeed, it is because they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of wisdom that these five transcendent perfections are designated as transcendent perfections.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1535}} Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, addressed Senior Śāradvatī­putra as follows: “Venerable Śāradvatī­putra! You say that it is because they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of wisdom that these five transcendent perfections are designated as transcendent perfections. However, Venerable Śāradvatī­putra, are these five transcendent perfections not designated as transcendent perfections when they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of generosity? Similarly, are these five transcendent perfections not designated as transcendent perfections when they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, when they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of tolerance, when they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of perseverance, or when they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1536}} “Kauśika,” he replied, “It is so! It is just as you have spoken. However, great bodhisattva beings who abide in the transcendent perfection of wisdom fully perfect the transcendent perfection of generosity, and similarly they fully perfect the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of perseverance, and the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration. So it is, Kauśika, that the transcendent perfection of wisdom is designated as beyond these five [lower] transcendent perfections. It is designated as the foremost, the best, the most excellent, the unsurpassed, and the highest.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1537}} Then Senior Śāradvatī­putra asked the Blessed One as follows: “Venerable Lord! How should the transcendent perfection of wisdom be actualized?”
The Blessed One replied to Senior Śāradvatī­putra as follows: “Śāradvatī­putra, the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized due to the non-actualization of physical forms. Similarly, the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized due to the non-actualization of feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness. Similarly, the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized due to the non-actualization of the transcendent perfection of generosity and the other transcendent perfections, up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom. Similarly, the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized due to the non-actualization of the emptiness of internal phenomena, and in the same vein, [of the other aspects of emptiness], up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities, as well as the applications of mindfulness and [the other causal attributes], up to and including the noble eightfold path, and the ten powers of the tathāgatas and [the other fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. Similarly, the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized due to the non-actualization of the understanding of all phenomena, and the non-actualization of the understanding of the aspects of the path and of omniscience.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1538}} “Venerable Lord! How is the transcendent perfection of wisdom to be actualized due to the non-actualization of physical forms? How is transcendent perfection of wisdom to be actualized due to the non-actualization [of all these other attributes and attainments], up to and including omniscience?”
The Blessed One replied, “Śāradvatī­putra, the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized because physical forms are not actualized, because they do not arise, because they are non-apprehensible, and because they do not disintegrate. Similarly, the transcendent perfection of wisdom should be actualized because feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness, and in the same vein, [all other attributes and attainments], up to and including omniscience, are not actualized because they do not arise, because they are non-apprehensible, and because they do not disintegrate.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1539}} Then Senior Śāradvatī­putra asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! When the transcendent perfection of wisdom is actualized in that manner, what thing is attained?”
“The Blessed One replied, “Nothing at all is attained. This is why it may be styled ‘the transcendent perfection of wisdom’.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1540}} “Venerable Lord! What are the things that are not attained?”
The Blessed One replied, “Virtuous phenomena and non-virtuous phenomena will not be attained. Similarly, mundane phenomena, supramundane phenomena, contaminated phenomena, uncontaminated phenomena, censurable phenomena, non-censurable phenomena, conditioned phenomena, and unconditioned phenomena will not be attained. If you ask why, Śāradvatī­putra, the transcendent perfection of wisdom does not establish anything at all in an apprehending manner. For this reason nothing at all is attained.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1541}} Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! Does the transcendent perfection of wisdom not attain and not apprehend even omniscience?”
The Blessed One replied, “Kauśika, it is so! It is just as you have spoken. This transcendent perfection of wisdom does not attain and does not apprehend even omniscience.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1542}} “Venerable Lord! In what way does the transcendent perfection of wisdom not attain and not apprehend even omniscience?”
The Blessed One replied, “Kauśika, the transcendent perfection of wisdom does not attain [even] the transcendent perfection of wisdom, whether in the sense of a designation, in the sense of an intimation, or in the sense of a formulation.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1543}} “Venerable Lord! How then does it bring about attainment?”
The Blessed One replied, “It brings about attainment insofar as it does not admit, not establish, not abandon, not adhere to, and not attain anything at all. Kauśika, so it is that the transcendent perfection of wisdom brings about the attainment of all things, without attaining anything at all.”
Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! How wonderful that this transcendent perfection of wisdom is established because all things neither arise nor do they cease, and they are unconditioned, unapprehended, and without fixation!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1544}} Thereupon, Senior Su­bhūti said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! If great bodhisattva beings wonder whether the transcendent perfection of wisdom brings about the attainment of all things, but perceive to the contrary that it does not bring about attainment, in that case, Venerable Lord, those bodhisattvas would undervalue the transcendent perfection of wisdom and keep far away from it.”
The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti! There is a distinct way in which bodhisattvas might undervalue the transcendent perfection of wisdom and keep far away from it. If, Su­bhūti, when bodhisattvas practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom, they were to perceive, ‘Alas! The transcendent perfection of wisdom is flaccid, insignificant, and pointless. Alas! The transcendent perfection of wisdom is vacuous,’ in that case, they would undervalue the transcendent perfection of wisdom and keep far away from it. Su­bhūti! That is the distinct way in which bodhisattvas might undervalue the transcendent perfection of wisdom and keep far away from the transcendent perfection of wisdom.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1545}} Then, Senior Su­bhūti asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! If one trusts in the transcendent perfection of wisdom, what are the things in which one should not trust?”
The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti! If you have conviction in the transcendent perfection of wisdom, you should not have conviction in physical forms. Similarly, you should not have conviction in feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness. You should not have conviction in the eyes, and you should not have conviction in [the other sense organs], up to and including the mental faculty. You should not have conviction in the sense field of sights, and you should not have conviction in [the other sense objects], up to and including mental phenomena. Similarly, you should not have conviction in the transcendent perfection of generosity, and you should not have conviction in the other transcendent perfections, up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom. You should not have conviction in the emptiness of internal phenomena, and you should not have conviction in the other aspects of emptiness, up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities. You should not have conviction in the applications of mindfulness, and you should not have conviction in [the other causal attributes], up to and including the noble eightfold path. Similarly, you should not have conviction in the ten powers of the tathāgatas, and you should not have conviction in [the other fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. You should not have conviction in the fruit of entering the stream. Similarly, you should not have conviction in the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth, to the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth, and to the fruit of arhatship. You should not have conviction in individual enlightenment. You should not have conviction in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. You should not have conviction in the understanding of all phenomena. You should not have conviction in the understanding of the aspects of the path. You should not have conviction in omniscience.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1546}} “On the other hand, Su­bhūti, you should have conviction in the transcendent perfection of wisdom because physical forms are non-apprehensible. Similarly, you should have conviction in the transcendent perfection of wisdom because feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness are non-apprehensible. In the same vein, you should have conviction in the transcendent perfection of wisdom because [all other attributes and attainments], up to and including omniscience, are non-apprehensible.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1547}} “Su­bhūti, those who have conviction in the transcendent perfection of wisdom, without apprehending anything, have conviction in physical forms; similarly, they have conviction in feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness. In the same vein, if they have conviction, [without apprehending anything,] in the transcendent perfection of wisdom, they will have conviction in [all those other attributes and attainments], up to and including omniscience.”
Senior Su­bhūti then said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! This transcendent perfection of wisdom is the great transcendent perfection.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1548}} The Blessed One asked, “Su­bhūti, for what reasons do you think this transcendent perfection of wisdom is the great transcendent perfection?”
He replied, “It does not enhance physical forms, nor does it diminish them. Similarly, it does not enhance feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness, nor does it diminish them. It does not enhance the transcendent perfection of generosity, nor does it diminish it. Similarly, it does not enhance the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of perseverance, and the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration, nor does it diminish them. Similarly, it does not enhance the emptiness of internal phenomena, nor does it diminish it. Similarly, it does not enhance the other aspects of emptiness, up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities, nor does it diminish them. Similarly, it does not enhance the applications of mindfulness, nor does it diminish them. Similarly, it does not enhance [the other causal attributes], up to and including the noble eightfold path, nor does it diminish them. It does not enhance the ten powers of the tathāgatas, nor does it diminish them. Similarly, it does not enhance [the other fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, nor does it diminish them. It does not enhance enlightenment; nor does it diminish it. It does not enhance buddhahood; nor does it diminish it.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1549}} “Moreover, the transcendent perfection of wisdom does not absorb physical forms, nor does it diffuse them. Similarly, it does not absorb feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions and consciousness; nor does it diffuse them. In the same vein, it does not absorb [all those other causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including buddhahood; nor does it diffuse them.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1550}} “Moreover, the transcendent perfection of wisdom does not measure physical forms, nor does it not measure them. In the same vein, it does not measure [all those other attributes], up to and including buddhahood; nor does it not measure them.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1551}} “Moreover, the transcendent perfection of wisdom does not enlarge physical forms, nor does it contract them. Similarly, it does not enlarge feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions and consciousness; nor does it contract them. In the same vein, it does not enlarge [all those other attributes], up to and including buddhahood;, nor does it contract them.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1552}} “Moreover, the transcendent perfection of wisdom does not strengthen physical forms, nor does it weaken them. Similarly, it does not strengthen feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness; nor does it weaken them. In the same vein, it does not strengthen [all those other attributes], up to and including buddhahood; nor does it weaken them.”
“Venerable Lord! For these reasons this transcendent perfection of wisdom is the great transcendent perfection, possessed by great bodhisattva beings.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1553}} “Venerable Lord! If great bodhisattva beings who have newly entered the [Great] Vehicle, perceive, contingent on the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and similarly contingent on the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration, the transcendent perfection of perseverance, the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, and the transcendent perfection of generosity, that the transcendent perfection of wisdom enhances or diminishes physical forms, and similarly, that it enhances or diminishes feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions and consciousness, and in the same vein, that it enhances or diminishes [all those other attributes], up to and including buddhahood; and in the same vein that it [absorbs or diffuses, measures or does not measure, enlarges or contracts, and] strengthens or weakens physical forms, and similarly, that it strengthens or weakens feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness, in that case, Venerable Lord, those great bodhisattva beings do not practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom. If you ask why, it is because anything that enhances or diminishes physical forms, and in the same vein, anything that enhances or diminishes [all those other attributes], up to and including buddhahood, cannot be an outcome of the transcendent perfection of wisdom. Anything that strengthens or weakens physical forms, and similarly, anything that strengthens or weakens feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness, and in the same vein, anything that strengthens or weakens [all those other attributes], up to and including buddhahood, cannot be an outcome of the transcendent perfection of wisdom.

If you ask why, it is because there is no enlightenment at all for those who have [such mistaken] perception.

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1565}} The Blessed One replied to Senior Ānanda as follows: “Ānanda! This is because the transcendent perfection of wisdom has precedence over the five [other] transcendent perfections; similarly, it has precedence over [all those other attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. Ānanda! Do you think that a gift undedicated toward omniscience may be styled as the transcendent perfection of generosity?”
“No, Venerable Lord!” he replied.

“No, Venerable Lord!” he replied.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1567}} Senior Ānanda then asked the Lord [Buddha], “Venerable Lord! In what way may a gift, when dedicated toward omniscience, be styled as the transcendent perfection of generosity, and in what way may [the other transcendent perfections], up to and including wisdom, when dedicated toward omniscience, be styled as the transcendent perfection of wisdom [and the rest]?”
The Blessed One replied, “Ānanda! When a gift is dedicated toward omniscience in a non-dual manner, it may be styled as the transcendent perfection of generosity. In the same vein, when [the other transcendent perfections], up to and including wisdom, are dedicated toward omniscience in a non-dual manner, they may be styled as the transcendent perfection of wisdom [and the rest]. Similarly, when these are dedicated toward omniscience in an uncreated manner and without apprehending anything, they may be styled as the transcendent perfection of wisdom [and the rest].”

The Blessed One replied, “Ānanda! Physical forms are empty of physical forms. Similarly, feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness are empty of consciousness [and the other aggregates]. In the same vein, [all other attributes], up to and including enlightenment, are empty of enlightenment [and the rest]. If you ask why, it is because the transcendent perfections and physical forms are indivisible and without duality. Similarly, [all other attributes], up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom and enlightenment, are indivisible and without duality.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1570}} “Ānanda! So it is that the transcendent perfection of wisdom is in the vanguard of these five [other] transcendent perfections, and in the same vein, it is in the vanguard of [all other attributes], up to and including omniscience. Just as the seeds that have been planted in a large field sprout and grow, with the large field acting as their support, in the same way, Ānanda, these five [other] transcendent perfections emerge dependent on the transcendent perfection of wisdom, with the transcendent perfection of wisdom acting as their support. Similarly, the four applications of mindfulness emerge dependent on the transcendent perfection of wisdom, as do [all other causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, and [all attainments], up to and including omniscience. Ānanda! The five [other] transcendent perfections and [those other attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, are dependent on omniscience.

If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because they should not be attentive to mental images even of the roots of virtue possessed by the tathāgatas and the community of śrāvakas of the tathāgatas.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1681}} Then Senior Su­bhūti said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom is profound.”
The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, this is because all phenomena are naturally void.”

The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, since it is unfabricated and unconditioned, there is no one at all who can attain manifestly perfect buddhahood.”

The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, so it is that the nature of phenomena is without duality. Su­bhūti, the nature of phenomena is entirely singular. Su­bhūti, this singular nature of phenomena is without inherent existence. Su­bhūti, this nature is the genuine nature. This genuine nature is unconditioned. Su­bhūti, so it is that when great bodhisattva beings know that the lack of inherent existence with respect to all phenomena is unconditioned, they abandon all the limits of attachment.”

The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, this is because the transcendent perfection of wisdom has not been seen, heard, or cognized by anyone at all.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1685}} “Venerable Lord! The transcendent perfection of wisdom is inconceivable.”
The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, this is because the transcendent perfection of wisdom has not been produced by mind, it has not been produced by physical forms, not by feelings, not by perceptions, not by formative predispositions, and not by consciousness. In the same vein as before, it has not been produced by the applications of mindfulness, and it has not been produced by [the other causal attributes], up to and including the noble eightfold path.

If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because this transcendent perfection of wisdom is most precious. Su­bhūti, the transcendent perfection of wisdom is precious in that it can liberate sentient beings from the hells, and it can liberate them from the birthplaces of animals, the world of Yama, and the impoverished states of human beings, yakṣas, and nāgas.

Approaching the Blessed One, they prostrated with their heads toward the feet of the Blessed One, and stood to one side. Then, even as they stood to one side, the gods inhabiting the world system of desire and the world system of form asked the Blessed One, “With regard to this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom which the Venerable Lord is explaining, what, O Lord, are the defining characteristics of this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1828}} The Blessed One replied to those gods as follows: “Gods, this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom has the defining characteristic of emptiness. Gods, this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom has the defining characteristic of signlessness, and the defining characteristic of aspirationlessness. Similarly, O gods, this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom has the defining characteristic of non-conditioning, the defining characteristic of non-arising, the defining characteristic of non-cessation, the defining characteristic of non-defilement, the defining characteristic of non-purification, and the defining characteristic of non-entity. Gods, although this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom has such defining characteristics, for the sake of the world the tathāgatas have named, symbolized, designated, and expressed it in conventional terms, but, O gods, that is not the case in ultimate reality. It cannot be disturbed by the world with its gods, humans, and antigods. If you ask why, it is because the world with its gods, humans, and antigods is also endowed with those very same defining characteristics.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1829}} “Similarly, O gods, defining characteristics are not perceived by means of defining characteristics. Nor is the absence of defining characteristics perceived by means of defining characteristics, nor are defining characteristics perceived by means of the absence of defining characteristics, nor even is the absence of defining characteristics perceived by means of the absence of defining characteristics. Therefore, O gods, as far as defining characteristics, the absence of defining characteristics, the defining characteristics of defining characteristics, and their combinations are concerned, it is impossible for any of them to know and for any of them to be known.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1830}} “Gods, these defining characteristics have not been conditioned by physical forms. They have not been conditioned by feelings, perceptions, and formative predispositions; nor have they been conditioned by consciousness. They have not been conditioned by internal emptiness. They have not been conditioned by external emptiness, nor have they been conditioned by external and internal emptiness, and, in the same vein, they have not been conditioned by the other aspects of emptiness, up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities. They have not been conditioned by [the attributes and attainments], extending from the applications of mindfulness, and so on, up to and including omniscience. Gods, these defining characteristics are neither human nor non-human; they neither have contamination nor are the without contamination; they are neither mundane nor are they supramundane; and they are neither conditioned nor are they unconditioned.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1831}} “Furthermore, O gods, do you think that if someone were to say that such and such is the defining characteristic of space, they would be speaking correctly?”
“O Lord, they would be incorrect in stating that [such and such] is the defining characteristic of space. If one were to ask why, Venerable Lord, it is because space is unconditioned. Therefore, it is not endowed with any defining characteristic whatsoever; nor is it thus endowed, because it is non-existent and non-apprehensible.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1832}} The Blessed One then addressed those gods inhabiting the world system of desire and those inhabiting the world system of form as follows: “Gods, whether the tathāgatas have appeared or whether the tathāgatas have not appeared [in the world], the expanse that is the defining characteristic of reality is itself established. The tathāgatas are called tathāgatas because they have genuinely attained manifestly perfect buddhahood.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1833}} The gods then said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! Because they have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood with regard to those defining characteristics, the tathāgatas engage in the perception of pristine cognition which is unobstructed with respect to phenomena. It is due to having been established in these defining characteristics that the tathāgatas have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood with regard to this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, whose defining characteristics transcend all attachments. These defining characteristics through which the tathāgatas have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood are profound.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1834}} “Venerable Lord, how wonderful is this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom within the perceptual range of the Tathā­gata, Arhat, Genuinely Perfect Buddha—the Tathā­gata who became a bodhisattva in former lives by engaging therein, and acquired the five extrasensory powers of the bodhisattvas, and who then, in this very lifetime, attained manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to omniscience, and, having attained manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to omniscience, comprehended all these defining characteristics.

Similarly, he comprehends the defining characteristics of the transcendent perfection of generosity. He comprehends the defining characteristics of the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of perseverance, the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration, and the transcendent perfection of wisdom.

Similarly, feelings have the defining characteristic of emotional experience, perceptions have the defining characteristics of comprehensibility, formative predispositions have the defining characteristic of conditioning, and consciousness has the defining characteristic of particularizing intrinsic awareness, but the tathāgatas attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to the absence of all their defining characteristics.

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1845}} Then the Blessed One addressed Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti! The transcendent perfection of wisdom gives rise to the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas, and it instructs them. Therefore, the tathāgatas are established, intimately dependent on this transcendent perfection of wisdom. As such, they honor, venerate, respect , and make offerings to the doctrines of the transcendent perfection of wisdom. So it is, Su­bhūti, that the tathāgatas honor, venerate, respect , and make offerings to this very sacred doctrine of the transcendent perfection of wisdom. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas originate from this transcendent perfection of wisdom, and because the tathāgatas are grateful and thankful for this transcendent perfection of wisdom. Su­bhūti, rightly would one speak if one were to say correctly that the tathāgatas are grateful and thankful. Su­bhūti, if you ask how the tathāgatas are grateful and thankful, it is, Su­bhūti, because the tathāgatas continuously honor, venerate, respect , and make offerings to, and similarly favor and pursue, the vehicle and the path—that is to say, the vehicle through which they have reached [the level of] a tathāgata, and the path by which they have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. In this sense, Su­bhūti, it should be recognized that the tathāgatas are grateful and thankful.

The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, it is so! It is just as you have spoken. All things are unknowable and invisible. If you ask, Su­bhūti, how all things are unknowable and invisible, all things, Su­bhūti, are unsupported and uncontained. For this reason, Su­bhūti, all things are unknowable and invisible, and accordingly, Su­bhūti, the transcendent perfection of wisdom gives rise to the tathāgatas, and instructs the worlds [of sentient beings]. Furthermore, it is instructive because physical forms are unseen. Similarly, it is instructive because feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness are unseen. In the same vein, it is instructive because [all attributes and attainments], up to and including omniscience, are unseen.

The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, this transcendent perfection of wisdom is instructive because physical forms are unseen when there is no consciousness arising that apprehends physical forms. Similarly, this transcendent perfection of wisdom is instructive because consciousness [and the other aggregates] are unseen when there is no consciousness arising that apprehends feelings, that apprehends perceptions, that apprehends formative predispositions, and that apprehends consciousness. Likewise, in the same vein, this transcendent perfection of wisdom is instructive because [all attributes and attainments], up to and including omniscience, are unseen when there is no consciousness arising that apprehends omniscience, and so forth.

Therefore the attributes of the tathāgatas are inconceivable and free from concepts, unappraisable and free from appraisals, and equal to the unequaled and free from parity with the unequaled. Su­bhūti, that which is unthinkable is designated as unthinkable. That which is unappraisable is designated as unappraisable. That which is innumerable is designated as innumerable. Su­bhūti, it is for these reasons, too, that the attributes of the tathāgatas, which the tathāgatas possess, are inconceivable, equal to the unequaled, and so forth. For example, Su­bhūti, just as space is inconceivable and equal to the unequaled, in the same way, Su­bhūti, the attributes of the tathāgatas are inconceivable and equal to the unequaled. Indeed they cannot be conceived, appraised, or quantified by the world with its gods, humans, and antigods. Similarly, the attributes which the tathāgatas possess are innumerable.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1869}} While [the Blessed One] was delivering this chapter concerning the attributes of the tathāgatas which are inconceivable, unappraisable, innumerable, and equal to the unequaled, the minds of five hundred fully ordained monks were liberated from contaminants, and freed from grasping, [which is the immediate cause of rebirth]. The minds of two hundred fully ordained nuns were liberated from contaminants, and freed from grasping. Six hundred laymen and three hundred laywomen developed the unobscured and immaculate eye of the sacred doctrine . Two thousand bodhisattvas came to accept that phenomena are non-arising, and they all received prophetic declarations [concerning their future enlightenment] within this Auspicious Eon.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1870}} This completes the twentieth chapter from the Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines , entitled “Enlightened Attributes.” {{note:{index:358,id:UT22084-031-002-1871}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1872}} Then Senior Su­bhūti said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! This transcendent perfection of wisdom is profound. Venerable Lord! This transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of great deeds. Accordingly, Venerable Lord, this transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of unappraisable deeds, innumerable deeds, and deeds that are equal to the unequaled.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1873}} Then the Blessed One addressed Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, it is so! It is just as you have said. This transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of great deeds. This transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of deeds that are equal to the unequaled, and so forth. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because the five [other] transcendent perfections are subsumed within this transcendent perfection of wisdom; the emptiness of internal phenomena is subsumed within it; the other aspects of emptiness, up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities, are subsumed within it; the four applications of mindfulness are subsumed within it; and in the same vein, [the other causal attributes], up to and including the noble eightfold path, are subsumed within it. The ten powers of the tathāgatas are subsumed within it. Su­bhūti, [all the other fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, are subsumed within this transcendent perfection of wisdom.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1874}} “Su­bhūti, just as a king of the royal class who has been empowered through coronation delegates all the royal functions and royal duties that he exercises concerning the citizens to his obedient subjects and senior ministers—delegating responsibility so that he has few concerns—in the same way, Su­bhūti, all the doctrines of the śrāvakas, or all the doctrines of the pratyekabuddhas, or all the doctrines of the bodhisattvas, or all the doctrines of the genuinely perfect buddhas, as many as they are, are subsumed within the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and it is the transcendent perfection of wisdom which implements them. So, for these reasons, Su­bhūti, this transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of great deeds. This transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of deeds that are equal to the unequaled, and so forth, in order that one might not appropriate or become fixated on physical forms, and likewise, in order that one might not appropriate and become fixated on feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness, and in the same vein as before, in order that one might not appropriate and become fixated on [all attributes and attainments], up to and including omniscience.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1875}} Senior Su­bhūti then asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! How is this transcendent perfection of wisdom established in order that one might not appropriate and become fixated on physical forms? How is it established in order that one might not appropriate and become fixated on feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness? How is it established in order that one might not appropriate and become fixated on [all attributes and attainments], up to and including omniscience?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1876}} Then the Blessed One addressed Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti! Do you consider those physical forms which the transcendent perfection of wisdom could appropriate or become fixated upon?”
“No, Venerable Lord!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1877}} The Blessed One continued, “Su­bhūti, Do you consider those feelings, those perceptions, those formative predispositions, and those modes of consciousness that the transcendent perfection of wisdom could appropriate or become fixated upon?”
“No, Venerable Lord!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1878}} The Blessed One continued, “Su­bhūti, Do you consider [those attributes and attainments], up to and including omniscience, that the transcendent perfection of wisdom could appropriate or become fixated upon?”
“No, Venerable Lord!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1879}} “That is it! That is it, Su­bhūti! It is just as you have said. I also do not consider those [physical forms] {{note:{index:359,id:UT22084-031-002-1880}}} that the transcendent perfection of wisdom could appropriate or become fixated upon. Likewise, I also do not consider those feelings, those perceptions, those formative predispositions, and those modes of consciousness that the transcendent perfection of wisdom could appropriate or become fixated upon. I also do not consider those [attributes and attainments], up to and including omniscience, that the transcendent perfection of wisdom could appropriate or become fixated upon. So it is that the bodhisattvas who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should not appropriate or become fixated on physical forms; in the same vein, they should not appropriate or become fixated on [any attributes and attainments], up to and including omniscience.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1881}} Then the gods inhabiting the world system of desire and those inhabiting the world system of form said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! This transcendent perfection of wisdom is profound, hard to discern, and hard to realize! It cannot be investigated and it is not within the range of sophistry. It can be known by the wise and by those skilled in examining its subtlety. Venerable Lord! Great bodhisattva beings who have heard this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom and formed aspirations regarding it include those who fulfilled their higher deeds in the presence of former conquerors, those who have planted the roots of virtuous action, and those who have been accepted by spiritual mentors. Venerable Lord! Compared to the cognition and exertion of all those sentient beings in the world systems of the great trichiliocosm, as many as they are, who have become followers through faith, and similarly those who have become followers of the sacred doctrine, who have reached the eighth level, who have entered the stream, who are tied to one more rebirth, who are no longer subject to rebirth, who have attained arhatship, and who have become pratyekabuddhas—when any who accept this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom for but a single day, wishing for it, appraising it, or investigating it, it is their cognition and exertion that will be greater, not the cognition and exertion of those who have become followers through faith, those who have become pratyekabuddhas, and so forth. If one were to ask why, it is because, in contrast to the cognition and exertion of those who have become followers through faith, and similarly the cognition and exertion of those who have become pratyekabuddhas, great bodhisattva beings have accepted that phenomena are non-arising.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1882}} Then the Blessed One addressed those gods inhabiting the world system of desire and those gods inhabiting the world system of form as follows: “O gods! It is so! It is so! It is just as you have said. O gods! I say that when any sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who have heard this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom; who, having heard it, aspire toward it; who, having aspired toward it, commit it to writing, or have it committed to writing; or who, after similarly holding and teaching it, are attentive in the correct manner to the pristine cognition of genuinely perfect buddhahood—those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage will more swiftly attain final nirvāṇa by means of the pristine cognition of genuinely perfect buddhahood, not those sons or daughters who are followers of the vehicle of the śrāvakas, and who practice according to other sūtras apart from the transcendent perfection of wisdom, for an eon or longer than an eon. If you ask why, O gods, it is because those perfect doctrines associated with the attainment of manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment are extensively revealed in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, consequent on the doctrines in which followers through faith, and so on, up to and including those who have attained arhatship and those who have become pratyekabuddhas, should train, and the doctrines in which great bodhisattva beings have trained.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1883}} Then the gods inhabiting the world system of desire and those inhabiting the world system of form said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! This transcendent perfection of wisdom is the great transcendent perfection. Venerable Lord! This transcendent perfection of wisdom is the unappraisable transcendent perfection, the innumerable transcendent perfection, and the transcendent perfection that is equal to the unequaled. Venerable Lord! Having trained in this transcendent perfection of wisdom, those who have become followers through faith, those who have reached the eighth level, those who have entered the stream, those who are tied to one more rebirth, those who are no longer subject to rebirth, those who have attained arhatship, and those who have become pratyekabuddhas will all attain emancipation in the expanse of nirvāṇa, in which no residue of the psycho-physical aggregates is left behind. Having trained therein, great bodhisattva beings will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, and they will attain final nirvāṇa, in which no residue of the psycho-physical aggregates is left behind. Yet this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom will neither be diminished nor replenished.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1884}} Then the gods extolled the teachings of the Blessed One. Rejoicing, they prostrated with their heads toward the feet of the Blessed One and circumambulated him three times before departing from his presence. Having gone not very far, they departed through their miraculous powers and became invisible, the gods inhabiting the world system of desire proceeding to the world system of desire, and the gods inhabiting the world system of form proceeding to the world system of form.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1885}} Then Senior Su­bhūti asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! When those individuals who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas have heard this transcendent perfection of wisdom, and, immediately after hearing it, form aspirations toward it; and, as before, commit it to writing, retain, hold, and master it; and are always attentive to it in the correct manner, and so forth, from where will they pass away and be reborn into this [human world]?”
The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, those individuals who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas immediately having heard this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, form aspirations toward it, and, as before, commit it to writing, retain, hold, and master it, and are always attentive to it in the correct manner. They will always follow in pursuit, from whence they came, to hear this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom. Su­bhūti, just as a milch cow follows after her new-born calf, in the same way when those who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas, immediately after hearing this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, form aspirations toward it, and, as before, commit it to writing, retain, hold, and master it, and are always attentive to it in the correct manner—those individuals who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas will exclusively pass away among humankind and be reborn among humankind. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because those individuals who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas in this way after hearing, retaining, holding, mastering, and being attentive to this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom in the correct manner in their former lives—and having, in the above manner, committed it to writing, compiled it as a book, and then honored, revered, and respected it with flowers, garlands, unguents, powders, butter lamps , incense, clothing, parasols, victory banners, and ribbons—will, through these roots of virtuous action, abandon the eight unfavorable conditions, and be reborn among humankind.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1887}} Then Senior Su­bhūti asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! How could individuals endowed with enlightened attributes who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas have honored the lord buddhas in other buddhafields, and then have passed away to be reborn in this [human world], where they hear this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, and immediately after hearing it, form aspirations toward it, and, having formed aspirations, commit it to writing, have it committed to writing, and similarly, retain, hold, and be attentive to it in the correct manner?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1888}} The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, There are individuals following the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who have honored the lord buddhas in other buddhafields, and then have passed away to be reborn in this [human world], where they hear this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, and immediately after hearing it, form aspirations toward it, and, having formed aspirations, commit it to writing, have it committed to writing, and similarly, retain, hold, master, and are attentive to it in the correct manner. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because those individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas have previously heard this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom from the lord buddhas in other buddhafields, and similarly, have retained, held, mastered, and been attentive to it in the correct manner, and so forth. Through these roots of virtuous action, after they passed away, they have been reborn in this [human world].
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1889}} “Moreover, Su­bhūti, there are individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who have heard this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom among the god realms of Tuṣita, [and so forth], and who have been attentive to it in the correct manner, and so forth. You should know that henceforth, by putting an end to the accumulation of non-virtuous actions, and by means of these roots of virtuous action, which are associated with hearing the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and by cultivating the transcendent perfection of wisdom, they have been reborn therein, with fortune equal to that of humankind, and they are also endowed with those same attributes. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because those individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who have been born in the abode of Tuṣita have questioned and counter-questioned the great bodhisattva being Maitreya concerning this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1890}} “Su­bhūti, there are individuals followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who, in former lives, heard and received clear instruction in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, and who have been reborn in this [human world], without having had an opportunity to pose questions and counter-questions, and who, when they now hear this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, harbor doubts, hesitation and disillusionment with regard to this same profound transcendent perfection of wisdom.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1891}} “Similarly, there are individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who, in former lives, have heard and received clear instruction in this profundity of the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration, the transcendent perfection of perseverance, the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, and the transcendent perfection of generosity, and who have been reborn in this [human world], without having had an opportunity to pose questions and counter-questions, and who, when they now hear this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, harbor doubts, hesitation and disillusionment with regard to it.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1892}} “Moreover, Su­bhūti, there are individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who, in former lives, have heard and received clear instruction on the emptiness of internal phenomena, and similarly on the emptiness of external phenomena, and [on all the other aspects of emptiness], up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities, and who have been reborn in this [human world], without having had an opportunity to pose questions and counter-questions, and who, when they now hear this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, harbor doubts, hesitation and disillusionment with regard to it.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1893}} “Moreover, Su­bhūti, there are individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who, in former lives, have heard and received clear instruction on the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four supports for miraculous ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, the noble eightfold path, the three gateways to liberation, the eight aspects of liberation, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, and so forth, and who have been reborn in this [human world], without having had an opportunity to pose questions and counter-questions, and who, when they now hear this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, harbor doubts, dullness, hesitation, and disillusionment with regard to this same profound transcendent perfection of wisdom.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1894}} “Moreover, Su­bhūti, there are individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who, in former lives, have heard this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, and even experientially cultivated it and meditated upon it for a single day, or for two days, or for three, four, or five days, but who were not captivated by this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, and indeed subsequently succumbed to hesitation. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because those individuals who lack an earnest focus, without cultivating those sacred doctrines and without earnestly applying them, will turn out like that.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-1895}} “Su­bhūti, those individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who have embarked on this vehicle, but who, not long after, were not accepted by a spiritual mentor and did not revere many buddhas, do not commit this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom to writing; nor do they retain, hold, and master it; nor do they read it aloud, recite it, confer its transmission, or be attentive to it in the correct manner. You should know that they have not even trained in this transcendent perfection of wisdom, nor have they trained in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration, the transcendent perfection of perseverance, the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, and the transcendent perfection of generosity. Similarly, they have not trained in the emptiness of internal phenomena, and they have not trained in [the other aspects of emptiness]—the emptiness of external phenomena, the emptiness of external and internal phenomena, and so forth, up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities. Similarly, they have not trained in the applications of mindfulness, and they have not trained in the correct exertions, the supports for miraculous ability, the faculties, the powers, the branches of enlightenment, the noble [eightfold] path, the eight aspects of liberation, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, and so forth.

If you ask why, it is because those who did not commit this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom to writing; who did not have it committed to writing; who neither retained, held, nor mastered it; and who neither read it aloud nor recited it, and who did not confer its transmission and were not attentive to it in the correct manner, have not applied themselves earnestly, as instructed, in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom.

The people on board who wish to save their lives, but who do not catch and hold on to a wooden plank, log, leather bag, or human corpse, will surely encounter death without reaching the ocean shore. Su­bhūti, it is like when an ocean-going vessel or a great ship is wrecked at sea, and the people on board who wish to save their lives do catch and hold on to a wooden plank, log, leather bag, or human corpse, and will safely and securely stand upon the ocean shore, uninjured and unharmed. In the same way, Su­bhūti, those individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who have a modicum of faith and a modicum of joy with regard to this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, but who do not commit this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom to writing; do not have it committed to writing; do not retain, hold, or master it; who do not read it aloud or recite it, confer its transmission or be attentive to it in the correct manner; and who do not apply themselves earnestly, as instructed, in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, will actualize the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhas without reaching the maturity of the bodhisattvas. However, Su­bhūti, if those individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who are endowed with faith, tolerance, serene joy, confidence , higher aspiration, volition, and renunciation; who relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment is attained; and who commit this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom to writing, and similarly retain, hold, and master it; read it aloud and recite it; confer its transmission; are attentive to it in the correct manner; and apply themselves earnestly, as instructed, in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, then that faith, that tolerance, that confidence , that higher aspiration, that willingness, that volition, that renunciation, and that unrelenting perseverance until unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment is attained, will increase and flourish since they have been accepted by the transcendent perfection of wisdom. They will not degenerate from the transcendent perfection of wisdom, omniscience, and so forth. Having brought sentient beings to maturity and having even refined the buddhafields, they will swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment.

The unfired jar could not last long and would swiftly disintegrate into common clay. If you ask why, it is because the jar is unfired, and because it is soft. In the same way, Su­bhūti, when other individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who are endowed with faith, tolerance, confidence , higher aspiration, willingness, volition, and renunciation, and who relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment is attained, but who, nonetheless, lack the transcendent perfection of wisdom, are unskilled, they will similarly be unskilled with respect to the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration, the transcendent perfection of perseverance, the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, and the transcendent perfection of generosity. Similarly, being unskilled, they will be without the emptiness of internal phenomena, the emptiness of external phenomena, and the other aspects of emptiness, up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities. Similarly, being unskilled, they will be without the applications of mindfulness, the correct exertions, the supports for miraculous ability, the faculties, the powers, the branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path; in the same vein, being unskilled, they will not have cultivated [the fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. Since such individuals, being unskilled, do not become familiar with omniscience, they will degenerate from those [superior] attributes due to their inappropriate actions, which are only associated with interim states. Su­bhūti, what are the interim states with which those individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who have degenerated from those [superior] attributes due to their inappropriate actions are only associated?

That jar will not disintegrate, even though it is often immersed in water, and it can be used to fetch water whenever the man or woman wishes. In the same way, Su­bhūti, individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who are endowed with faith, tolerance, confidence , higher aspiration, willingness, volition, and renunciation, and who relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment is attained, are not separated from the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and engage in the conduct of a bodhisattva without lacking skillful means.

Wherever you wish to go, whatever your mind seeks and wherever it wishes to go, with our support, you should not have the slightest fear of falling down, however far you go!’ In the same way, Su­bhūti, when individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas are endowed with faith, tolerance, confidence , higher aspiration, willingness, volition, and renunciation, and relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment is attained, but are not separated from the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and are not without skill in means, for this reason other bodhisattvas, apart from them, should know that those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage have been favored by the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration, and similarly, by the transcendent perfection of perseverance, the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, and the transcendent perfection of generosity, and in the same vein, that those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage have been favored by [all attributes and attainments], up to and including omniscience. Such great bodhisattva beings will exclusively not regress from those [superior] attributes in the interim, until they attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment.

Furthermore, Śāradvatī­putra, although the path of enlightenment followed by those great bodhisattva beings does possess the [three] gateways to liberation—emptiness, signlessness and aspirationlessness—they are still not favored by wisdom and by skill in means, for which reasons, after they have actualized the finality of existence, they will become śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2037}} Senior Śāradvatī­putra then asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! Why is it that those persons who follow the vehicles of the śrāvakas or the pratyekabuddhas cultivate the nature of things that is emptiness, signlessness, and aspirationlessness, but, without being favored by the transcendent perfection of wisdom and without skill in means, merely actualize the finality of existence and become śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas, whereas great bodhisattva beings who also cultivate the nature of things that is emptiness, signlessness, and aspirationlessness are favored by the transcendent perfection of wisdom and are endowed with skill in means, in consequence of which they actualize the finality of existence, and attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2038}} The Blessed One then replied to Senior Śāradvatī­putra as follows: “Śāradvatī­putra, in this regard, there are some persons whose minds are without omniscience, who have not been favored by the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and who are without skill in means, and who, when cultivating the nature of things that is emptiness, signlessness, and aspirationlessness become śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas. Again, Śāradvatī­putra, there are great bodhisattva beings whose minds are not without omniscience, who have been favored by the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and who are not without skill in means, and who consequently have actualized great compassion, and who, when cultivating the nature of things that is emptiness, signlessness, and aspirationlessness, enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas and attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. For example, Śāradvatī­putra, suppose there were a wingless bird with a body one hundred fathoms or three hundred fathoms in size dwelling amidst the gods of the Trāyastriṃśa realm, which considered migrating from there to this Jambu­dvīpa, thinking, ‘I should dwell in Jambu­dvīpa!’ and having set out had second thoughts on the way down, wishing, ‘Now I should stay among the gods of the Trāyastriṃśa realm, without descending to Jambu­dvīpa!’ do you think, Śāradvatī­putra, that this wingless bird would be able to resettle among the gods of the Trāyastriṃśa realm?”
“No, Venerable Lord!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2039}} The Blessed One replied, “Again, Śāradvatī­putra, suppose this wingless bird while descending from there were to think, ‘O! May I land in Jambu­dvīpa without being wounded or injured!’ do you think, Śāradvatī­putra, that this wingless bird would land in Jambu­dvīpa without being wounded or injured?”
“No, Venerable Lord! It would descend to Jambu­dvīpa absolutely wounded and injured, and die or experience mortal sufferings. If one were to ask why, Venerable Lord, it is because this is just what would happen to any bird whatsoever, with a large body and no wings, falling from on high.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2040}} The Blessed One replied, “It is so, Śāradvatī­putra! It is just as you have said. Similarly, Śāradvatī­putra, when persons who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas, even after dispensing generosity, and similarly maintaining their ethical discipline, cultivating tolerance, undertaking perseverance, achieving meditative concentration, and cultivating wisdom over many eons, then cultivate the nature of things that is emptiness, signlessness, and aspirationlessness while lacking the transcendent perfection of wisdom and lacking skill in means, they will actualize the finality of existence and then descend to the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas. If you ask why, it is because the minds of those persons who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas are without omniscience. When they meditate on these things over many eons, dispensing generosity, and similarly maintaining their ethical discipline, cultivating tolerance, undertaking perseverance, achieving meditative concentration, and cultivating wisdom, inasmuch as they are not favored by the transcendent perfection of wisdom and are without skill in means, they will descend to the levels of the śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2041}} “Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, when persons who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas consider, conceptualize, and grasp the meditative stabilities of the lord buddhas of the past, future, and present, as well as their wisdom, ethical discipline, liberation, and their perception of liberating pristine cognition, even though they meditate, they will not understand even a fraction of the ethical discipline of the tathāgatas. Similarly, they will not understand even a fraction of the liberation of the tathāgatas, or of their liberating pristine cognition. Also, while they lack understanding and perception, they will hear talk about the path of enlightenment, regarding the nature of things that is emptiness, signlessness, and aspirationlessness. They will be attentive to that talk, conceptualize it, and having done so, they will even dedicate this toward unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. Those persons who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas, making such dedications, will settle into the levels of the śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas. If you ask why, Śāradvatī­putra, it is because those who have not been favored by the transcendent perfection of wisdom and are without skill in means will incur this very outcome.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2042}} “Śāradvatī­putra, great bodhisattva beings who, from the time when they first began to set their mind on enlightenment, dispense generosity, maintain ethical discipline, cultivate tolerance, undertake perseverance, and are equipoised in meditative concentration, without being separated from the mental cultivation of omniscience, will not be without the transcendent perfection of wisdom and skill in means. Consequently, they will not conceptualize the ethical discipline of the lord buddhas of the past, future, and present, nor their meditative stability, wisdom, liberation, and perception of liberating pristine cognition. They will not conceptualize the meditative stability of emptiness. They will not conceptualize the meditative stability of signlessness or the meditative stability of aspirationlessness. One should know that they are approaching unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. If you ask why, it is because even though those great bodhisattva beings may have dispensed generosity from the time when they first began to set their mind on enlightenment, they have not conceptualized it. Even though they may have maintained ethical discipline, they have not conceptualized it. Even though they may have cultivated tolerance, they have not conceptualized it. Even though they may have undertaken perseverance, they have not conceptualized it. Even though they may have become equipoised in meditative concentration, they have not conceptualized it. Even though they may have cultivated wisdom, they have not conceptualized it. Indeed, they have not conceptualized the ethical discipline of the lord buddhas of the past, future, and present, nor their meditative stability, wisdom, liberation, or perception of liberating pristine cognition. Śāradvatī­putra, those who, with a mind free from conceptualization, dispense generosity, maintain ethical discipline, cultivate tolerance, undertake perseverance, become equipoised in meditative concentration, and, in the same vein, practice in accordance with omniscience, are skilled in the means of great bodhisattva beings.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2043}} [Śāradvatī­putra] then said, “As I understand the meaning of the words spoken by the Blessed One, there is no doubt that those great bodhisattva beings who, from the time when they first began to set their mind on enlightenment, have not been without the transcendent perfection of wisdom and skill in means, will attain unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. If one were to ask why, Venerable Lord, it is because those great bodhisattva beings, from the time when they first began to set their mind on enlightenment, have never apprehended anything which would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood, or through which they would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood, or on the basis of which they would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood, from physical forms, feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness up to and including omniscience.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2044}} “Venerable Lord! Those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas, and who are not separated from the transcendent perfection of wisdom and skill in means, will undoubtedly attain unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. If one were to ask why, Venerable Lord, it is because those who are not separated from the transcendent perfection of wisdom and skill in means have not conceptualized the generosity which they have dispensed. Similarly, they have not conceptualized the ethical discipline which they have maintained, nor have they conceptualized the tolerance which they have cultivated, the perseverance which they have undertaken, the meditative concentration in which they have become equipoised, or the wisdom which they have cultivated. This being the case, it is for these reasons that those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas will undoubtedly attain unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2045}} “This being the case, Venerable Lord, great bodhisattva beings who would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, through their higher aspiration are favored by the transcendent perfection of wisdom and are not without skill in means. Abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdom and endowed with skill in means, with a mind that is free from conceptualization, they should dispense their generosity, and similarly, maintain their ethical discipline, cultivate tolerance, undertake perseverance, become equipoised in meditative concentration, and cultivate wisdom. In the same vein as before, they should engage with [all the other attributes and attainments], up to and including omniscience.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2046}} Then the gods inhabiting the world system of desire and the gods inhabiting the world system of form said to the Blessed One, ”Venerable Lord! Unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment is hard to manifest! It is astonishing that great bodhisattva beings should indeed attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to all things, without exception, while, Venerable Lord, all those things are indeed non-existent and non-apprehensible!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2047}} The Blessed One replied, “O gods! It is so. It is just as you have said. Unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment is hard to manifest. O gods! I have indeed attained manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to all things and in all ways. Ultimately, however, there is nothing apprehended with respect to which I would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood, or nothing by which I would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood, or nothing on the basis of which I would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood. If you ask why, it is because all things are utterly pure on account of the emptiness of conditioned phenomena and the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2048}} Then Senior Su­bhūti said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! When the Blessed One just said ‘O gods! Unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment is hard to manifest,’ as I understand and ponder the meaning of the words spoken by the Lord, it seems that unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment is easy to manifest, and it is easy to attain manifestly perfect enlightenment. If one were to ask why, Venerable Lord, it is because all things are empty of all things. Manifestly perfect buddhahood will not be attained with respect to anything at all, or indeed by anything at all. All things being empty, anything with respect to which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attained, anything by which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attained, and anything on the basis of which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attained is non-existent and non-apprehensible. If one were to ask why, Venerable Lord, it is because all things are empty of all things, and things are non-existent and non-apprehensible—even those which great bodhisattva beings seek to reduce or enhance, while they dispense generosity, and similarly, maintain ethical discipline, cultivate tolerance, undertake perseverance, become equipoised in meditative concentration, cultivate wisdom, and in the same vein, engage with omniscience, and so forth. Venerable Lord! For these reasons, the unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment of great bodhisattva beings is easy to bring forth, and it is easy to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood! If one were to ask why, Venerable Lord, it is because physical forms are empty of their own essential nature. Similarly, feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness are empty of their own essential nature. In the same vein, [all other phenomena, causal and fruitional attributes, and attainments], up to and including omniscience, are empty of their own essential nature.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2049}} Then, Senior Śāradvatī­putra addressed Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Senior Su­bhūti, it is for this very reason that the unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment of the bodhisattvas is extremely hard to bring forth, and it is extremely hard to attain manifestly perfect enlightenment. Just as space does not entertain the thought, ‘I must attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment,’ in the same way, Senior Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings also do not entertain the thought, ‘I should attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment!’ If you ask why, Senior Su­bhūti, it is because all things are equal to space. Once great bodhisattva beings accept that all things resemble space, they will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. Senior Su­bhūti, if, once great bodhisattva beings accept that all things resemble space, it were easy for them to bring forth unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, and it were easy to attain manifestly perfect enlightenment, and it were not hard to bring this forth, and not hard to attain manifestly perfect enlightenment, then great bodhisattva beings, numerous as the sands of the River Ganges, who don the armor, would not regress from unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. For this reason, Senior Su­bhūti, it is clear that unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment is extremely hard to bring forth, and it is hard to attain manifestly perfect enlightenment.”

The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti, “Great bodhisattva beings who wish to attain emancipation in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment should abide in a state of equanimity with respect to all sentient beings. They should cultivate a state of equanimity with respect to all sentient beings, and having established this even-mindedness, they should offer benedictions and greetings to all sentient beings with a benevolent attitude. They should cultivate loving kindness with respect to all sentient beings. They should minimize pride with respect to all sentient beings. They should cultivate the notion that they are teaching all sentient beings. They should offer benedictions and greetings to all sentient beings with sweet and gentle words. They should cultivate an attitude that is free from enmity with respect to all sentient beings. They should cultivate an attitude that is free from harming with respect to all sentient beings. They should cultivate an attitude that regards all sentient beings as their parents, brothers, and sisters. They should cultivate an attitude that regards all sentient beings as their friends, peers, and kinsmen. They should offer benedictions and greetings with an attitude that regards all sentient beings as their parents, brothers, sisters, friends, peers, and kinsmen. They should also abstain from killing living creatures and they should encourage others to adhere to the genuine path by abstaining from killing living creatures. They should always praise abstention from the killing of living creatures. They should praise and rejoice in others who abstain from the killing of living creatures. In the same vein as before, they themselves should abstain from wrong views, and so forth, and they should encourage others also to adhere to the genuine path by abstaining from wrong views. They should praise abstention from wrong views and they should praise and rejoice in others who abstain from wrong views. It is in this way, Su­bhūti, that great bodhisattva beings who seek to attain emancipation in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment should maintain these doctrines, and do so without apprehending anything.

By whatever means they make such determinations, they should do so with an unwavering mind. When the mind is unwavering, they will discern those phenomena exactly as they are. Even if they were to consider those phenomena, they would not actualize them. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because such bodhisattvas will have trained well with regard to those phenomena which are empty of their own defining characteristics.

They discern that this is not the time for actualization and discern that this is the time for investigation. Even though great bodhisattva beings may not have established their minds in equipoise, they do focus their minds on [meditative] objects.

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2128}} “For example, Su­bhūti, suppose there was a heroic man, steadfast in his commitments, of fine physique, handsome, beautiful to behold, and well trained in archery, who had also handled sharp weapons, perfected the sixty-four crafts, fully mastered all the arts, cultivated the eighteen great fields of knowledge, {{note:{index:383,id:UT22084-031-002-2129}}} and who was outstanding, joyful, and crowd-pleasing—he would acquire great rewards through whatever tasks he had to undertake since he would have trained well in all fields, and on those occasions the crowd of common people would indeed honor him, respect him, and grant him offerings, causing him again to rejoice, in joy, utter joy, and at ease. If he were then, for some purpose, to escort his parents, brother, sister, wife, son, daughter, and daughter-in-law, entering a remote and hair-raising wilderness where childish persons are afraid, he would exhort his parents, brother, sister, wife, son, daughter and daughter-in-law as they went in, ‘Do not fear! I will get you out, safely and securely, and swiftly release you from this fearful and most terrifying place.’ Even if enemies, murderers, and a band of assailants were to harass them in that wilderness, he, being endowed with the supreme power of discernment, would lead his parents, brother, sister, wife, son, daughter and daughter-in-law from that wilderness safely and securely, and get them back to a village, city, or market town, making sure that they stay there, joyful, comfortable, unharmed and uninjured; but he would not wish to attack those sentient beings, nor would he be agitated. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because a man such as this would have been proficiently trained in archery, and, besides that, in all other useful skills.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2130}} “Similarly, Su­bhūti, when great bodhisattva beings have achieved and maintain a state of mind that is imbued with loving kindness, compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity, at that time, those great bodhisattva beings are established in the four immeasurable aspirations and they perfect the six transcendent perfections. After perfecting the six transcendent perfections, they will not achieve the cessation of contaminants but they will absolutely investigate omniscience; and even though they are established in emptiness, signlessness and aspirationlessness, they will not be swayed or captivated by them. Indeed they will not actualize those gateways to liberation, which, by means of actualization, would cause them to regress to the levels of the śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2131}} “For example, Su­bhūti, a bird does not fall to the ground, even though it moves through the air. It flies through the sky but does not dwell therein, and is unsullied. Similarly, Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings investigate the gateways to liberation—emptiness, signlessness and aspirationlessness— and they are even established therein, but they do not actualize those gateways to liberation—emptiness, signlessness and aspirationlessness, which, when actualized, would cause them to regress to the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas, without perfecting the attainment of omniscience by means of the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four assurances, the four unhindered discernments, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2132}} “For example, Su­bhūti, when a powerful man trained in archery fires an arrow far into the sky, and then fires a succession of other arrows, one after another, he can prevent that [first] arrow from falling to the ground as long as he wishes, but if he were to think, ‘Alas! I wish this arrow would fall to the ground!’ and he then ceases to fire the subsequent arrows far into the sky, the arrows would all fall to the ground in succession, one after the other. Similarly, Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom that is retained by skill in means do not actualize the finality of existence until the roots of virtuous action have been brought to maturity in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. But when those roots of virtuous action have been brought to maturity in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, then they do actualize the authentic finality of existence. So it is, Su­bhūti, that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should make a definitive analysis in accord with the reality of these phenomena.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2133}} Then Senior Su­bhūti said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! How wonderful it is, Venerable Lord, that while great bodhisattva beings have trained in this reality, trained in the finality of existence, trained in the real nature, trained in the expanse of reality, trained in the emptiness that transcends extremes, trained in the emptiness of independent characteristics, and trained in the three gateways to liberation, and so forth, the difficult achievement of great bodhisattva beings is that they do not regress in the interim [before attaining unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment]. This is most amazing!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2134}} The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, such great bodhisattva beings do not forsake all sentient beings and they maintain such extraordinary aspirations. Su­bhūti, those great bodhisattva beings magnanimously think, ‘I will not forsake all sentient beings. I alone should release all those sentient beings who maintain inauthentic doctrines.’ So it is that great bodhisattva beings, for the sake of those sentient beings, then actualize emptiness as a gateway to liberation, and similarly, they actualize signlessness as a gateway to liberation, and aspirationlessness as a gateway to liberation. One should know that the non-actualization of the finality of existence by great bodhisattva beings until they have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment indicates their skill in means with respect to emptiness, signlessness, and aspirationlessness as gateways to liberation.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2135}} “Moreover, Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings always analyze the profound topics, which are as follows: the emptiness of internal phenomena [and the other aspects of emptiness], up to and including the emptiness of essential nature with respect to non-entities, and similarly, the four applications of mindfulness and [other causal attributes], up to and including the noble eightfold path. They always analyze the three gateways to liberation. Accordingly, they also think, ‘In order that these sentient beings who, over a long period of time, have fallen under the sway of evil associates, who continue to apprehend egotistical views, and likewise who apprehend [notions] of sentient beings, and so on, up to and including [notions of] experiencers and experiencing subjects, might abandon these views, I will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, and teach the sacred doctrine to those sentient beings who continue to apprehend in such ways!’ At that time, even though great bodhisattva beings become equipoised in the meditative stability of emptiness as a gateway to liberation, as far as the realization of the finality of existence is concerned, they do not actualize that finality of existence through which the fruit of entering the stream, the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth, the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth, arhatship, and individual enlightenment are actualized.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2136}} “When great bodhisattva beings become equipoised in the meditative stability of signlessness as a gateway to liberation, or in the meditative stability of aspirationlessness, at that time they do actualize all things that are free from contaminants, and yet, as far as the actualization of the finality of existence is concerned, they do not actualize that finality of existence through which the fruit of entering the stream, and so forth, up to and including individual enlightenment, are actualized.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2137}} “Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom accordingly, and who have set their mind on enlightenment and these roots of virtuous action, do not, in the interim, actualize the finality of existence. They will not degenerate from the four meditative concentrations, the four formless concentrations, the four applications of mindfulness, and so on. They will not degenerate from the noble eightfold path. They will not degenerate from emptiness, signlessness, and aspirationlessness—the gateways to liberation. Similarly, they will not degenerate from the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four assurances, the four unhindered discernments, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas.

I should attain enlightenment for the sake of those sentient beings. By any means I should swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment and teach them the sacred doctrines that [all things are] impermanent, imbued with suffering, and without a self, and that nirvāṇa is peace.’ Although they have set their minds accordingly [on enlightenment] and practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom through skill in means, they will not enter into the meditative stabilities of the buddhas. At that time, they possess the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four assurances, the four unhindered discernments, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, and though they may even become equipoised in those [fruitional] attributes, they will not actualize the finality of existence until they have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment.

Nor should they become dependent on them. Su­bhūti, having perceived them through their cognition and view, they should transcend these levels, and enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2176}} “Su­bhūti, the bodhisattvas who train in this manner indeed approach omniscience. They swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. They become worthy recipients of the donations of the whole world, with its gods, humans, and antigods. They surpass all other worthy recipients of worldly donations—virtuous ascetics, brāhmin priests, śrāvakas, or pratyekabuddhas—and they become worthy recipients of patronage. They do not forsake the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and they do not lack the transcendent perfection of wisdom.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2177}} “Su­bhūti, one should know that great bodhisattva beings who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom in this manner possess the attribute of not regressing from omniscience. They give the levels of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas a wide berth, and approach unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2178}} “If, however, they were to think, ‘This is the transcendent perfection of wisdom! That is subsumed within this transcendent perfection of wisdom! Thereby I will attain omniscience!’—when they perceive in that way, they do not practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom. Rather, they should not perceive the nature of the transcendent perfection of wisdom, designating it with words such as, ‘This is the practice of the transcendent perfection of wisdom!

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2183}} Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, thought, “If great bodhisattva beings surpass sentient beings while just practicing this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom, what need one say when they have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood, the genuinely perfect enlightenment! If even those sentient beings whose minds are just introduced to omniscience find wealth, and if even those sentient beings sustain themselves through noble livelihoods, what need one say about those who have set their minds on the aspiration toward unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment! Those sentient beings who have set their minds on the aspiration toward unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, and even those who have not yet done so, are to be envied when they always listen to this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2184}} Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, took coral tree flowers and scattered them, scattered them more vigorously, and scattered them with utmost vigour toward the Tathā­gata, Arhat, Genuinely Perfect Buddha, saying, “By this merit may the sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas, with their higher focus intent on unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, perfect the attributes of the buddhas! May they also perfect omniscience! May they also perfect the attributes that naturally arise, and may they also perfect the attributes that are free from contaminants!
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2185}} “Venerable Lord! I do not in the slightest think that the sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas will ever regress from unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment and become śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas. I do, however, think that they will long for unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, and that they will aspire even more toward unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. Seeing the sufferings of those involved in cyclic existence, they will resolve to seek the benefit of the whole world, with its gods, humans, and antigods, and seek to alleviate [its sufferings]. Great bodhisattva beings who possess this mind will always think, ‘Once I have crossed beyond cyclic existence, should I save those sentient beings who have not yet crossed beyond it? Once I have been liberated from cyclic existence, should I liberate those sentient beings who have not yet been liberated? Once I have been inspired, should I inspire those sentient beings who have not yet been inspired? Once I have attained final nirvāṇa, should I bring to final nirvāṇa those sentient beings who have not attained final nirvāṇa?’

How much merit will those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage accrue—those who rejoice in the minds of great bodhisattva beings who are beginners entering the vehicle, and similarly, who rejoice in the minds of great bodhisattva beings who have been practicing over a long period of time, and similarly, who rejoice in the minds of irreversible great bodhisattva beings, and similarly, who rejoice in the minds of those great bodhisattva beings who are tied to only one more rebirth?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2187}} The Blessed One then replied to Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, “Kauśika, you may be able to measure with weights this world system of the four continents, but you cannot measure the merits of those who have set their mind on enlightenment deriving from the rejoicing of those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage. Kauśika, you may be able to measure with a tip of a hair, split one hundredfold, all the drops of water in the oceans of this world system of the great trichiliocosm, but you cannot measure the merits of those who have set their mind on enlightenment deriving from the rejoicing of those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2188}} Then Śakra, mighty lord of the gods, said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! Those who would not rejoice in sentient beings who set their mind on enlightenment are inspired by demonic forces. Venerable Lord! Those who would not rejoice in sentient beings who set their mind on enlightenment are on the side of demonic forces. Venerable Lord! Those who would not rejoice in sentient beings who set their mind on enlightenment have been reborn here after dying in the domain of demonic forces. If one were to ask why, it is because those who have successfully set their mind on enlightenment and dedicated the merit toward unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment actually shatter the domain of demonic forces. One should rejoice in those who have set their mind on the aspiration toward unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. Those who do not forsake the Buddha, who do not forsake the Dharma, and who do not forsake the Saṅgha {{note:{index:389,id:UT22084-031-002-2189}}} should rejoice in those who have set their mind on enlightenment. Then, having rejoiced in them setting their mind on enlightenment, they should dedicate the merit to unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, without engaging in the notion that the setting of the mind on enlightenment is singular, or the notion that it is dual, or the notion that it is plural.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2190}} The Blessed One replied, “Kauśika, It is so! It is just as you have said. Those who rejoice in these [bodhisattvas] who set their mind on enlightenment will swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. Even those who engage in the conduct of a bodhisattva will swiftly please the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas. They will never again perceive unpleasant sights. They will never hear unpleasant sounds. They will never smell unpleasant odors. They will never savor unpleasant tastes. They will never touch unpleasant tangible objects. They will never be conscious of unpleasant mental phenomena. They will never lack the sight of the buddhas. They will move from buddhafield to buddhafield, and they will venerate the lord buddhas. They will also develop the roots of virtuous actions because they are of benefit to all sentient beings. If you ask why, it is because those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage have rejoiced in the roots of virtuous action of beginners entering the vehicle, who are innumerable and immeasurable in number. Similarly, they have rejoiced in the roots of virtuous action of those bodhisattvas who abide on the first level, and similarly of those great bodhisattva beings who abide on [the other levels], up to and including the tenth level, and similarly of those great bodhisattva beings who are tied to only one more rebirth.

The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, do you think that you should consider this illusion-like mind?”
“Venerable Lord! I do not consider illusion or illusion-like mind.”

“No, Venerable Lord!

“Venerable Lord! I do not consider anything which would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, but which is other than illusion, or other than illusion-like mind. Venerable Lord! Since I do not consider anything extraneous, what thing, existent or non-existent, could arise? Nor could any phenomena, absolutely void, be attributed and sustained as existent or non-existent. Anything that could not be sustained as existent or non-existent, could not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. Indeed, anything non-existent could not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. If one were to ask why, Venerable Lord, it is because all things that are subject to affliction or purification are non-existent.

So it is that the transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely void, and similarly, the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration, the transcendent perfection of perseverance, the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, and the transcendent perfection of generosity are all absolutely void. In the same vein, [all other causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including enlightenment, are absolutely void. Anything that is absolutely void is neither to be cultivated nor not to be cultivated. Since this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely void, it cannot attain anything at all. Since this transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely void, how do great bodhisattva beings attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, dependent on the transcendent perfection of wisdom?

Su­bhūti, although great bodhisattva beings practice the sacred doctrine and its profundities, they achieve something difficult—that is to say, they do not at all actualize the goals either of the level of the śrāvakas or of the level of the pratyekabuddhas.”

Similarly, sentient beings should be regarded as emptiness because space itself is emptiness, and sentient beings should be regarded as essencelessness because space itself is essenceless. For this reason, divine princes, it is difficult for great bodhisattva beings who don the armor of great compassion for the sake of sentient beings who do not exist.

The third aspect of liberation ensues when beings are inclined toward pleasant states. The fourth aspect of liberation ensues when the perceptions of physical forms have been completely transcended in all respects, when the perceptions of obstructed phenomena have subsided, and the mind does not engage with diverse perceptions, so that one achieves and abides in the sense field of infinite space, thinking, ‘Space is infinite.’ The fifth aspect of liberation ensues when the sense field of infinite space has been completely transcended in all respects, and when one achieves and abides in the sense field of infinite consciousness, thinking, ‘Consciousness is infinite.’ The sixth aspect of liberation ensues when the sense field of infinite consciousness has been completely transcended in all respects, and one achieves and abides in the sense field of nothing-at-all, thinking, ‘There is nothing at all.’ The seventh aspect of liberation ensues when the sense field of nothing-at-all has been completely transcended in all respects, and one achieves and abides in the sense field of neither perception nor non-perception.

Endowed with such disciplines, they do not assert the supremacy of anything at all, and so they do not think, ‘Through this ethical discipline, may I be reborn equal in fortune to the royal class, standing out like a tall sāl tree!’ Similarly, they do not think, ‘May I be reborn equal in fortune to the priestly class, standing out like a tall sāl tree, or among the householder class, standing out like a great sāl tree!’ Similarly, they do not think, ‘May I be reborn as a universal monarch— lord of the four continents !’ Similarly, they do not think, ‘Through this ethical discipline, may I be reborn equal in fortune to the gods of the Catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm!’ Similarly, they do not think, ‘May I be reborn equal in fortune to the gods of the Trayas­triṃśa realm, to those of the Tuṣita realm, those of the Nirmāṇa­rata realm, and those of the Para­nirmita­vaśa­vartin realm!’ Similarly, they do not think, ‘Through this ethical discipline, may I attain the fruit of one who has entered the stream, or the fruit of one tied to one more rebirth, or the fruit of one who is no longer subject to rebirth, or arhatship, or the fruit of individual enlightenment, or the maturity of the bodhisattvas, or unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment!’

Things that are without defining characteristics cannot acquire things that are without defining characteristics. Nor can things that have dissimilar defining characteristics acquire things that have dissimilar defining characteristics. Nor can things without defining characteristics acquire things with dissimilar defining characteristics. Nor can things with dissimilar defining characteristics acquire things without defining characteristics. So it is, Su­bhūti, that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom will perfect the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline that is without defining characteristics, and, having embarked on the maturity of the bodhisattvas, will accept that phenomena are non-arising.

Then they will venerate the lord buddhas, bring sentient beings to maturation, and also refine the buddhafields. They will move from buddhafield to buddhafield. Then, even if they frequent cyclic existence with its five classes of living beings, they will not be sullied at all by the faults of cyclic existence. Just as a phantom may stand, sit, move, walk, and even lie down, but remains unsullied by the positive and negative effects of past actions, in the same way they may also act on behalf of sentient beings, without apprehending sentient beings or even the designation of sentient beings. Just as a tathāgata, arhat, genuinely perfect buddha, who is said to be utterly calm, and who, after turning the wheel of the sacred doctrine, no longer apprehends anyone foreordained to attain unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, may then let go of the formative predispositions of his [current] lifespan , having sent forth an emanation, and pass into final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa, where there is no residue of the psycho-physical aggregates, in the same way, great bodhisattva beings may even act on behalf of sentient beings, without apprehending sentient beings or even the designation of sentient beings.

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2308}} “Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings perfect the transcendent perfection of tolerance in two ways. If you ask what these two are, they comprise the tolerance of suffering and the tolerance that understands the profound nature of phenomena . Among them, the tolerance of suffering implies that, from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they are seated at the Focal Point of Enlightenment, even if all sentient beings were to arrive in the presence of those great bodhisattva beings and reprimand and rebuke them with harsh words, or strike them with clods of earth, clubs, weapons, or tools, these great bodhisattva beings, seeking to perfect the transcendent perfection of tolerance, would not have even the slightest thought imbued with anger or malice, but they would discern those beings, thinking, ‘O! These sentient beings are tormented by the ailments of afflicted mental states. Above all, I should exercise compassion, and I should not have negative thoughts. I have put an end to the grasping of those five acquisitive psycho-physical aggregates which revert to hostility.’ When they act accordingly, with loving kindness and compassion, this is called the tolerance of suffering.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2309}} “If you ask what is the tolerance that understands the profound nature of phenomena , it is as follows: Since even those sentient beings who presently assume such [inimical forms] are ultimately non-apprehensible, [bodhisattvas] should think, ‘Who is scolding or reprimanding me with harsh words? Who is beating me with clubs, striking me with weapons, and whipping me? All formative predispositions are illusion-like. They are void, hollow, vacuous, and like space. They are without a self, sentient beings, living creatures, lives, individuals, humankind, and human beings. All conceptualizing is unreal. Since they derive from imagination, who in fact is scolding or striking me? Owing to the emptiness of essential nature and owing to the emptiness of ultimate reality, I should not conceptualize in these ways.’ When they think accordingly, this is called the tolerance that understands phenomena . When they cultivate, comprehend, and investigate these two modes of tolerance, they accept that phenomena are non-arising, and indeed perfect the transcendent perfection of tolerance.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2310}} Then Senior Su­bhūti asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! What is acceptance that phenomena are non-arising? What is its extent? What is its cognition?”
The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, for those great bodhisattva beings not even the slightest negative phenomenon will arise. There is no egotism or possessiveness. They acquire the definitive tolerance of all formative predispositions which are dreamlike, and the definitive tolerance of all [other exemplars of the formative predispositions], up to and including formative predispositions that are like a phantom. This therefore is called the acceptance that phenomena are non-arising.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2311}} Then Senior Su­bhūti asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! What are the distinctions or differences between the following three kinds of acceptance: the acceptance which śrāvakas acquire with respect to the truth that phenomena are non-arising, the acceptance which pratyekabuddhas acquire [with respect to the truth that phenomena are non-arising], and the acceptance which bodhisattvas acquire with respect to [the truth] that phenomena are non-arising?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2312}} The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, the acceptance of great bodhisattva beings includes the cognition and correct exertion of those who enter the stream. Similarly, the acceptance of great bodhisattva beings includes the cognition and correct exertion of those who are tied to one more rebirth, those who are no longer subject to rebirth, and those who are arhats. The acceptance of great bodhisattva beings includes the cognition and correct exertion of those who are pratyekabuddhas. This then is the distinction and difference between the acceptance of the śrāvakas, the acceptance of the pratyekabuddhas, and the acceptance of the bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2313}} “Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings who possess such acceptance surpass all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. Abiding in this acceptance, they perfect the understanding of the aspects of the path. When they possess this understanding of the aspects of the path, they will not lack the thirty-seven aspects of enlightenment, and similarly, they will not lack the meditative stabilities of emptiness, signlessness, and aspirationlessness, or of the five extrasensory powers that arise through the maturation of past actions. Possessing these extrasensory powers [and so forth], they will travel from buddhafield to buddhafield, and they will venerate those lord buddhas, honoring them with all resources, and they will also bring sentient beings to maturation and refine the buddhafields. Consequently, having brought sentient beings to maturation and refined the buddhafields, they will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, by means of instantaneous wisdom. So it is, Su­bhūti, that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom perfect the transcendent perfection of tolerance, which is without defining characteristics.

Those endowed with miraculous abilities will traverse the world systems of the ten directions, numerous as the sands of the River Ganges, and then venerate the lord buddhas, and honor them with all resources.

In addition, one who possesses mental perseverance, which is included within the path and the branches of the path free from contaminants, will perfect the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four supports for miraculous ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, the noble eightfold path, the three gateways to liberation, the four immeasurable aspirations, the four formless absorptions, the eight aspects of liberation, the nine serial steps of meditative equipoise, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four assurances, the four unhindered discernments, the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, and all virtuous attributes.

All of them will attain emancipation through the three vehicles. Su­bhūti, this transcendent perfection of perseverance, with which great bodhisattva beings are endowed, is esteemed in this manner.

They will also achieve and maintain loving kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity, alongside the [formless absorptions], from the sense field of infinite consciousness up to and including the sense field of neither perception nor non-perception.

If you ask why, it is because great bodhisattva beings understand that the defining characteristics of those meditative stabilities have an essential nature of non-entity . Just as anything without defining characteristics cannot relish an attribute that is without defining characteristics, and just as a non-entity cannot relish a non-entity, they do not relish [these meditative stabilities], and so they will not be reborn in the world system of desire, in the world system of form, or the world system of formlessness through any of these meditative stabilities. If you ask why, it is because they do not apprehend those world systems, and so they do not apprehend anything at all—neither anyone entering into absorption, nor that by which they would enter into absorption. Since all things are non-apprehensible, they will perfect the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration that is without defining characteristics. Through the transcendent perfection of meditative stability, they will transcend the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhas.”

The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings have been well trained in the emptiness of internal phenomena, and they have been well trained in [all the other aspects of emptiness], up to and including the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, but they do not apprehend anything at all apart from those aspects of emptiness. Since they abide in accordance with those [aspects of emptiness], wherever they abide they do not apprehend anything at all that would attain the fruit of entering the stream, or the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth, or the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth, or arhatship, or individual enlightenment. They even consider omniscience to be emptiness. Endowed with those aspects of emptiness, they will transcend the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhas, and enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas.”

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2327}} “Venerable Lord! What is apprehension? What is non-apprehension?”
The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, physical forms constitute apprehension for great bodhisattva beings. Similarly, feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness constitute apprehension for great bodhisattva beings. Similarly, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the body, and the mental faculty constitute apprehension for bodhisattvas. Similarly, sights, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental phenomena constitute apprehension for bodhisattvas. In the same vein, [all causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including omniscience, constitute apprehension for bodhisattvas. Non-apprehension denotes the state in which these phenomena are non-dynamic, that is to say, in which no phenomena are apprehensible—no physical forms, feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions or consciousness, and similarly, no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mental faculty, and similarly, no sights, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, or mental phenomena, and similarly, no sensory element of the eyes, sensory element of sights or sensory element of visual consciousness, and similarly, no sensory element of the ears, sensory element of sounds, sensory element of auditory consciousness, sensory element of the nose, sensory element of odors, sensory element of olfactory consciousness, sensory element of the tongue, sensory element of tastes, sensory element of gustatory consciousness, sensory element of the body, sensory element of tangibles, sensory element of tactile consciousness, sensory element of the mental faculty, sensory element of mental phenomena or sensory element of mental consciousness, and similarly, no four applications of mindfulness, and in the same vein, [no other causal attributes], up to and including the noble eightfold path, and similarly, no ten powers of the tathāgatas, and in the same vein, [no other fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, and similarly, [no attainments], up to and including omniscience.

Since [bodhisattvas] indeed perfect all the meditative concentrations and formless absorptions but will not be reborn on account of these experiences, how could they possibly be reborn on account of desire, hatred, and delusion? That would be impossible! There is no possibility for them to actualize the karma of falling into cyclic existence, with its five classes of living beings, by assuming any rebirth or actualizing any karma. On the contrary, having precisely established that formative predispositions resemble an illusion, they always work for the benefit of sentient beings, but, on account of the essential nature, they do not apprehend sentient beings, nor do they even apprehend illusion. Since they apprehend neither sentient beings nor illusion, they may indeed bring sentient beings to maturation and refine the buddhafields.

Similarly, [they do not see and] they are not viewers of mirages, magical displays, or phantoms. If you ask why, it is because dreams, and similarly, echoes, optical aberrations, mirages, magical displays, or phantoms are the erroneous [misconceptions] of ordinary people, whereas, Su­bhūti, the arhats who are free from contaminants do not dream dreams, nor are they dreamers of dreams. Similarly, they do not see phantoms, nor are they viewers of phantoms, and so forth.

They do not see phantoms and they are not viewers of phantoms. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, since all things are unactualized and unoriginated, how could great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom acquire the notion of an entity, or the notion of genuine origination, or the notion of something that is authentic? That would be impossible!

Just as they do not apprehend this transcendent perfection of wisdom while practicing the transcendent perfection of wisdom, so when practicing the transcendent perfection of wisdom, they perceive that all things are gathered within this transcendent perfection of wisdom, but they do not apprehend any of those things. If you ask why, it is because these things and the transcendent perfection of wisdom are non-dual and indivisible. If you ask why, there are no particulars at all with respect to any things.

The Blessed One replied, “For that reason, Su­bhūti, you should know that all things are undifferentiated, without defining characteristics, and they neither arise nor cease. Su­bhūti, formerly, when I engaged in the conduct of a bodhisattva, I did not apprehend the essential nature of anything at all—from physical forms, feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, consciousness, conditioned phenomena, unconditioned phenomena, or the fruit of entering the stream, and so on, up to and including genuinely perfect enlightenment. So it is, Su­bhūti, that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom, from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they are seated at the Focal Point of Enlightenment, should be skillful with regard to the essential nature of all things. Skillful with regard to the essential nature of all things, great bodhisattva beings refine the path to enlightenment, and also bring sentient beings to maturation, refine the buddhafields, attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine, and then in various ways they instruct sentient beings so that they will no longer wander in the three impure realms, subject to rebirth.

Then they induce some sentient beings to enter and become established in the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four assurances, the four unhindered discernments, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2344}} “Then, since sentient beings have contaminants which are unrevealed and unimpeded, they establish some of these sentient beings in the fruit of entering the stream. They establish some in the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth, and they establish some in the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth, some in arhatship, and some in individual enlightenment. They then describe and reveal the path of perfect enlightenment to those who are earnestly intent upon unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. They encourage those sentient beings, and cause them to rejoice. So it is, Su­bhūti, that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom determine those things which are dreamlike, those things which are like a phantom, and so forth, those things that are non-entities, those that have an essential nature of non-entity, and those that are empty of intrinsic defining characteristics.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2345}} Then Senior Su­bhūti said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! How wonderful it is that great bodhisattva beings who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom should determine, when all things are dreamlike non-entities, with non-entity as their essential nature, and endowed with the emptiness of the unlimited and the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, that these are virtuous phenomena, those are non-virtuous phenomena, these are specific, those are non-specific, these are contaminated, those are uncontaminated, these are mundane, those are supramundane, these are conditioned, and those are unconditioned phenomena!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2346}} The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, so it is! It is exactly as you have said. It is a wonderful and marvelous attribute of great bodhisattva beings that great bodhisattva beings who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom can determine how all things are. If, Su­bhūti, you appreciate that the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas lack the wonderful and marvelous attributes of great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom, [you will understand that] it is consequently not easy for all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas to repay the favors of those great bodhisattva beings.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2347}} “Venerable Lord! What are the wonderful and marvelous attributes of great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom, which are unknown to all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas?”
The Blessed One replied, “Pay attention! I will explain the wonderful and marvelous attributes of great bodhisattva beings who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom. Su­bhūti, when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom abide in the six transcendent perfections, which arise through the maturation of past actions, and when they are established in the five extrasensory powers, the thirty-seven aspects of enlightenment, the gateways of mnemonic incantation, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four assurances, the four unhindered discernments, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, they may traverse the world systems of the ten directions, they may attract by their generosity those sentient beings who are attracted by generosity, and they may attract by wisdom [and the other transcendent perfections] those sentient beings who are attracted by ethical discipline, who are attracted by tolerance, who are attracted by perseverance, who are attracted by meditative concentration, and who are attracted by wisdom.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2348}} “Similarly, they may attract by the noble eightfold path and [the other causal attributes] those sentient beings who are attracted by the four immeasurable aspirations, the four meditative concentrations, and the four formless absorptions, as well as those who are attracted by the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four supports for miraculous ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2349}} “Similarly, they may attract by the meditative stability of aspirationlessness, [and so forth], those who are attracted by the meditative stability of emptiness, those who are attracted by the meditative stability of signlessness, and those who are attracted by the meditative stability of aspirationlessness.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2350}} “Su­bhūti, if you ask how great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom, abiding in the six transcendent perfections which arise through the maturation of past actions, and similarly, established in the five extrasensory power and the four unhindered discernments, attract by their generosity those sentient beings who are attracted by generosity, it is the case, Su­bhūti, that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom dispense their generosity toward sentient beings. That is to say, they give food to those who need food, drink to those who need drink, vehicles to those who need vehicles, clothing to those who need clothing, flowers to those who need flowers, garlands to those who need garlands, perfume to those who need perfume, unguents to those who need unguents, bedding to those who need bedding, asylum to those who need asylum, lamps who need lamps, and [everything else] to those who need anything else—from medicine to cure the sick, to [all the other] necessities of humankind, whatever they happen to be. Just as they make offerings to the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas, they also give religious robes, alms, bedding, medicines to cure the sick, and necessities to śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. They give flowers, garlands, perfume, unguents, powders, parasols, victory banners, ribbons, butter, grain-seed oils, and lamps. Just as they dispense generosity toward those who maintain ethical discipline, so they also dispense generosity toward those of degenerate morality. In the same way they dispense generosity toward human beings, and likewise they dispense generosity toward non-human beings. They do not discriminate between those who are worthy recipients and those who are unworthy. Rather, they dispense their generosity, having established the notion that all sentient beings are undifferentiated. If you ask why, since they realize that all things are undifferentiated, having comprehended and actualized this, they dispense generosity that is undifferentiated, and so they attain that which is undifferentiated—that is to say, omniscience.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2351}} “Su­bhūti, if, when great bodhisattva beings perceive a living creature who has been born in the animal realm, they were to think, ‘The worthy recipient of my generosity is the genuinely perfect Buddha, but not a living creature born in the animal realm,’ they would lack the attributes of a bodhisattva. If you ask why, it is because when their own minds are purified, they [also] purify the worthy recipients of the bodhisattvas’ generosity. Great bodhisattva beings should rather think, ‘When I have attracted these impoverished sentient beings by my generosity, they will not steal the property of others, they will be contented, and they will then also dispense generosity toward others. Similarly, when I attract them by my generosity, they will not take the life of living creatures. Similarly, when I attract them by my generosity, they will not lie, they will not slander, they will not speak harsh words, and they will not speak nonsensical words. On these bases, after they have passed away, they will be reborn as a householder within the royal class, like a mighty sāl tree. Similarly, they will be reborn as a householder within the priestly class, like a mighty sāl tree. They will be reborn as a householder within the householder [or mercantile] class, like a mighty sāl tree. On this basis, by means of the vehicle of the śrāvakas, the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas, or the vehicle of the genuinely perfect buddhas, they will attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa, where there is no residue of the psycho-physical aggregates.’
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2352}} “But great bodhisattva beings should not cultivate disparate thoughts of vacillation, thinking, ‘Perhaps I should not keep my former vow to become the protector of unprotected sentient beings, to become a sanctuary for those without sanctuary, and to become a guide for who those without a guide?’ Or, even if others, assailants or assassins, were to demand the body of a great bodhisattva being, they should not think, ‘Should I give it or not give it?’ Rather, with an unagitated mind, they should give their own bodies to those assailants and assassins. If you ask why, it is because they have indeed set out toward unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings, for their spiritual and temporal well-being, and not for the sake of their own bodies or lives. If they were to discriminate, thinking, ‘Should I give it or not give it?’, then the lord buddhas, great bodhisattva beings, the pratyekabuddhas, the other classes of sublime individuals apart from them, and the worlds of gods, humans, and antigods could indeed reproach {{note:{index:410,id:UT22084-031-002-2353}}} them with the words, ‘You should keep this pledge that you made in former lives, when someone asked you, and you vowed, ‘I will become a refuge, sanctuary, protector, ally, and guide to all sentient beings!’”

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2356}} Then Senior Su­bhūti asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! How do great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom attract sentient beings with the gift of the sacred doctrine?”
The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, there are two ways in which great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom attract sentient beings with the gift of the sacred doctrine. Su­bhūti, these comprise the mundane and supramundane gifts of the sacred doctrine. If you ask what constitutes the mundane gift of the sacred doctrine, that which describes, explains, demonstrates, and analyzes mundane phenomena—describing, explaining, demonstrating, and analyzing the [earlier] chapters on repulsive phenomena, along with the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable aspirations, the four formless absorptions, and the five extrasensory powers—is designated as the ‘mundane gift of the sacred doctrine.’ If you ask why this is mundane, it is called ‘mundane’ because it does not transcend the world.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2357}} “Having dispensed that mundane gift, for many reasons they then dissuade and turn sentient beings away from those meditative concentrations, immeasurable aspirations, formless absorptions, and extrasensory powers. Then, after dissuading and turning them away, they also establish them through skill in means in the sublime attributes, that is to say, they establish sentient beings in the four applications of mindfulness, and similarly in [the other causal attributes], up to and including the noble eightfold path, and the three gateways to liberation. Similarly, they establish them in the fruit of entering the stream, and in [the other fruits], up to an including individual enlightenment. This is called the ‘supramundane gift of the sacred doctrine.’ If you ask why it is supramundane, it is because it transcends the world and is exalted over the world systems.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2358}} “If, with regard to the sublime attributes, you ask what is the fruit of the sublime attributes, the term ‘sublime attributes’ denotes the thirty-seven aspects of enlightenment, the three gateways to liberation, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. The fruits of those sublime attributes comprise the fruit of entering the stream, and in the same vein, [all other fruits], up to and including unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2359}} “At the very least, Su­bhūti, the sublime attributes of great bodhisattva beings include the knowledge of the fruit of entering the stream, knowledge of [the other fruits], up to and including knowledge of the fruit of individual enlightenment, and similarly, knowledge of [the causal attributes], up to and including the thirty-seven aspects of enlightenment, and similarly, knowledge of the ten powers of the tathāgatas, and knowledge of [the other fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. Similarly, they include knowledge of contaminated and uncontaminated phenomena, of mundane and supramundane phenomena, and of conditioned and unconditioned phenomena. These are called the sublime attributes of great bodhisattva beings. Then, if you ask what constitute the fruits of the sublime attributes of great bodhisattva beings, these include the renunciation of all afflicted mental states, and of all propensities and impulses toward involuntary reincarnation.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2360}} Then Senior Su­bhūti asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! Will great bodhisattva beings also attain omniscience?”
The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, it is so! It is just as you have said. Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings will also attain omniscience.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2361}} “Venerable Lord! If great bodhisattva beings will also attain omniscience, what then is the distinction between great bodhisattva beings and the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas? How are these to be differentiated?”
The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings will attain omniscience, and, starting from the moment they attain omniscience, they will be called tathāgatas. Su­bhūti, the tathāgatas have absolutely reached the culmination of all things, and the bodhisattvas follow in their wake. The tathāgatas have attained non-stupidity with respect to all things, and the bodhisattvas will subsequently attain that [state]. This, Su­bhūti, is the distinction between the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas and great bodhisattva beings. This is how they are to be differentiated. Su­bhūti, the mundane gift of the sacred doctrine, with which great bodhisattva beings are endowed, is designated as the ‘support for the supramundane doctrine.’ So it is, Su­bhūti, that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom, through their skill in means, introduce sentient beings to the mundane gift of the sacred doctrine, and then introduce and establish them in the supramundane gift of the sacred doctrine, which is the abode of the sublime ones. Similarly they establish them in [all the causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including omniscience.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2362}} “Moreover, Su­bhūti, if you ask what constitutes the supramundane doctrines of great bodhisattva beings that are not shared in common with ordinary people, they comprise the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct exertions, the four supports for miraculous ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven aspects of enlightenment, the noble eightfold path, the three gateways to liberation, the four immeasurable aspirations, the four formless absorptions, the eight aspects of liberation, the nine serial steps of meditative equipoise, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four assurances, the four unhindered discernments, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, as well as all the virtuous attributes, the thirty-two major marks and eighty minor marks of a superior man, all the gateways of mnemonic incantation, and all the gateways of meditative stability. These constitute the supramundane doctrines of great bodhisattva beings, and the describing, explaining, demonstrating, and analyzing of these supramundane attributes is called the ‘supramundane gift of the sacred doctrine.’
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2363}} “In this regard, if you ask what constitute the four applications of mindfulness, great bodhisattva beings who are diligent, alert, and mindful, having eliminated covetousness and sadness with regard to the inner physical body, continue to observe the physical body. This same refrain should be extensively applied also to the outer physical body, and similarly to inner and outer feelings, as well as to mind and phenomena.

(2) They resolve, struggle, strive, persevere with tenacity, and rightly aspire that negative and non-virtuous attributes which have previously arisen might be renounced. (3) They resolve, struggle, strive, persevere with tenacity, and rightly aspire that virtuous attributes which have not yet arisen might be developed.

(2-4) Similarly, imbued with renunciation, dwelling in solitude, maintaining detachment and remaining in a state of cessation, they should cultivate the supports for miraculous ability combining the meditative stability of perseverance, the meditative stability of mind, and the meditative stability of scrutiny with the formative force of exertion.

This means that his physical form is elegant, fine, and beautiful to behold, just like an offering post fashioned of finest gold that is adorned with various gemstones, for which reason it is said to resemble the color of gold.
(15) The Blessed One is endowed with seven prominent parts. In this regard, the expression ‘seven prominent parts’ means that the two prominent [backs of] his legs are elegant, fine, and beautiful to behold, their flesh and blood fully distended. Similarly, the two prominent [backs of] his arms are elegant, fine, and beautiful to behold, their flesh and blood fully distended, and there are also two prominent parts at the two shoulders and one prominent part at the nape of the neck, which are elegant, fine, and beautiful to behold, their flesh and blood fully distended.

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2392}} “Those who have these major marks of a superior man, which the tathāgatas possess, naturally permeate this world system of the great trichiliocosm with their luminosity. When the tathāgatas speak, their major marks permeate innumerable, countless, immeasurable world systems with luminosity; then, once sentient beings have been favored with the power of the instructions, the tathāgatas consecrate them within their aureoles, extending a full arm span. When the tathāgatas cease to consecrate them in this way, both the moon and the sun will no longer exist in the world. Months, fortnights, seasons, and the annual cycles will no longer manifest in the world. But once sentient beings have been favored with the power of the instructions, the tathāgatas cause this world system of the great trichiliocosm to understand them by means of their natural buddha speech. When they speak, their mighty voice generates understanding, however exalted sentient beings may be [within the trichiliocosm]. All these enlightened attributes and advantages I have achieved when I was formerly a bodhisattva, by practicing the transcendent perfection of wisdom. So it is, Su­bhūti, that when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom, they attract sentient beings with their two gifts—the worldly gift and the gift of the sacred doctrine. This, Su­bhūti, is indeed the wonderful and marvelous doctrine of great bodhisattva beings.

Subsequently, they do so through the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline. Thereafter, they do so through the transcendent perfection of tolerance. Thereafter, they do so through the transcendent perfection of perseverance. Thereafter, they do so through the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration, and thereafter, they attract sentient beings through the transcendent perfection of wisdom. Su­bhūti, it is by means of these six transcendent perfections that great bodhisattva beings attract sentient beings through their pleasant speech. If you ask why, it is because these six transcendent perfections subsume all virtuous attributes.

May you gather a single syllable within the forty-two syllables!’ In this way, Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings should gather the forty-two syllables in a single syllable, and they should gather a single syllable within the forty-two syllables. Having mastered the forty-two syllables by means of a single syllable, and similarly having mastered a single syllable by means of the forty-two syllables, they become skilled in the formation of syllables. Having mastered the formation of syllables, they then become skilled in the formation of [speech] that is without syllables. For example, the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas are skilled in the sacred doctrine and skilled in syllables, and they teach through syllables the sacred doctrine that is without syllables. Indeed, Su­bhūti, there is no doctrine at all that is not included in the syllables and the absence of syllables.” {{note:{index:416,id:UT22084-031-002-2421}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2422}} Then Senior Su­bhūti asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! If, owing to the emptiness of the unlimited and the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, sentient beings, too, are never apprehensible, and nor indeed is the sacred doctrine apprehensible, and nor are even the natural expressions of the sacred doctrine apprehensible, then, [Venerable] Lord, how do great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections, and similarly practice the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurable aspirations, the four formless absorptions, and likewise, the thirty-seven branches of enlightenment, the fourteen aspects of emptiness, the meditative stabilities of emptiness, signlessness, and aspirationlessness, the eight aspects of liberation, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four assurances, the four unhindered discernments, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings by means of the six transcendent perfections which originate from the ripening [of past actions]?
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2424}} “Similarly, how do they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings by means of the six extrasensory powers which originate from the ripening [of past actions]? Sentient beings and the designation ‘sentient being’ are non-apprehensible. Since sentient beings are non-apprehensible, the psycho-physical aggregates, sensory elements, and sense fields are non-apprehensible. Similarly, since sentient beings are non-apprehensible, the six transcendent perfections are non-apprehensible, and in the same vein, [all the causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, are non-apprehensible. The eighty minor marks are non-apprehensible. Since sentient beings are non-apprehensible, nothing is designated as a sentient being. Nothing is designated as the psycho-physical aggregates, the sensory elements, and the sense fields, and in the same vein, nothing is designated as [the causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighty minor marks. This being the case, Venerable Lord, how would great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings?
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2425}} “Venerable Lord! Wouldn’t those great bodhisattva beings encourage sentient beings to acquire attributes that are non-existent, and wouldn’t this cause them to engage in or identify with erroneous views? If one were to ask why, Venerable Lord, it is because if those great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom do not apprehend even the nature of a bodhisattva, how could they possibly apprehend the attributes that are the aspects of enlightenment!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2426}} The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, it is so! It is exactly as you have said. Su­bhūti, it is because sentient beings are non-apprehensible that one should know the emptiness of internal phenomena, and likewise, the emptiness of external phenomena, the emptiness of both external and internal phenomena, the emptiness of emptiness, the emptiness of great extent, the emptiness of ultimate reality, the emptiness of non-dispersal, the emptiness of inherent existence, the emptiness of all things, the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, and [similarly], the emptiness of the psycho-physical aggregates, the emptiness of the sense fields, the emptiness of the noble truths, the emptiness of dependent origination, the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end, the emptiness of conditioned phenomena and of unconditioned phenomena, the emptiness of the self, the emptiness of sentient beings, and the emptiness of living creatures. In the same way, one should know lives, individuals, humankind, human beings, actors, instigators, experiencers, knowers, and viewers to be emptiness.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2427}} “Similarly, one should know the meditative concentrations, the immeasurable aspirations, and the formless absorptions to be emptiness, and also the applications of mindfulness, the correct exertions, the supports for miraculous ability, the faculties, the powers, the branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path to be emptiness. Similarly, one should know emptiness to be emptiness, signlessness to be emptiness, and aspirationlessness to be emptiness. Similarly, one should know the eight aspects of liberation and the nine serial steps of meditative absorption to be emptiness. Similarly, one should know the ten powers of the tathāgatas to be emptiness, and likewise the four assurances to be emptiness, the four unhindered discernments to be emptiness, great loving kindness to be emptiness, great compassion to be emptiness, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas to be emptiness.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2428}} “Similarly, one should know the fruit of entering the stream to be emptiness, and [the other fruits], up to and including the fruit of arhatship, to be emptiness, and individual enlightenment to be emptiness, the maturity of the bodhisattvas to be emptiness, genuinely perfect enlightenment to be emptiness, the buddhafields to be emptiness, and the maturation of sentient beings to be emptiness.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2429}} “Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom, having seen all things as emptiness, teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings who have been captivated by erroneous views, but they do not apprehend those sentient beings at all. They teach this sacred doctrine without transgressing those aspects of emptiness at all. Perceiving in this way, they know all things to be without obscuration, and then, without disturbing anything at all and without dualizing, they indeed teach [this sacred doctrine] exactly as it is. Su­bhūti, just as when an emanation of the tathāgatas projects many thousands of phantoms, some of whom engage in generosity, some in ethical discipline, some in tolerance, some in perseverance, some in meditative concentration, and some in wisdom, while some engage in the immeasurable aspirations, some in the formless absorptions, and some in the extrasensory powers, do you think, Su­bhūti, that that emanation would have detailed anything at all?”
“No, Venerable Lord!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2430}} The Blessed One continued, “For these reasons, Su­bhūti, you should know that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom establish sentient beings on the [bodhisattva] levels, just as they teach the sacred doctrine to them, and release them from erroneous views by means of that which is neither fettered nor liberated. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because physical forms are naturally neither fettered nor liberated. Similarly, feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness are naturally neither fettered nor liberated. Nor does the non-bondage and non-liberation of physical forms constitute physical forms; similarly, the non-bondage and non-liberation of feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness do not constitute consciousness [and the aforementioned aggregates]. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because physical forms, and similarly, feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness are absolutely pure. The same applies also to all conditioned and unconditioned phenomena.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2431}} “So it is, Su­bhūti, that although great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom do teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings, they do not apprehend sentient beings. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because those great bodhisattva beings abide in a non-abiding manner in the non-apprehension of all things. They abide in a non-abiding manner with respect to the emptiness of physical forms, and similarly [with respect to the emptiness] of feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness, and they abide in a non-abiding manner with respect to the emptiness of conditioned and unconditioned phenomena.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2432}} “Su­bhūti, in no respect do they abide in conditioned and unconditioned phenomena, or in the emptiness of conditioned phenomena. If you ask why, it is because those phenomena and those aspects of emptiness are without essential nature and without apprehension in which one might abide. Su­bhūti, non-entities do not at all abide in non-entity. Intrinsic entities do not abide in intrinsic entities, nor do extraneous entities abide in extraneous entities. If you ask why, it is because they are all non-apprehensible, and where could that which is non-apprehensible abide! So it is, Su­bhūti, that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom thoroughly cultivate these attributes owing to all the [aforementioned] aspects of emptiness.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2433}} “The lord buddhas, great bodhisattva beings, the pratyekabuddhas, the śrāvakas of the tathāgatas, and all sublime beings are all without defect. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because those lord buddhas, great bodhisattva beings, pratyekabuddhas, and śrāvakas of the tathāgatas all attain buddhahood and realization in pursuit of this reality, and they have exclusively demonstrated and continue to demonstrate all those phenomena to sentient beings without transcending the reality of those phenomena. If you ask why, it is because those phenomena do not transcend the expanse of reality, the real nature, and the finality of existence. If you ask why, it is because they are without any essential nature which might transcend.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2434}} Then Senior Su­bhūti asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! If things do not transcend the expanse of reality, the real nature, and the finality of existence, then are physical forms not one thing and the expanse of reality another, the real nature another, and the finality of existence another? Are [all the other aggregates], up to and including consciousness, not one thing, and mundane and supramundane phenomena another, contaminated and uncontaminated phenomena another, and conditioned and unconditioned phenomena yet another?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2435}} The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, that is not so!”
“Venerable Lord! If physical forms are not one thing, and the expanse of reality another, and if [all the other aggregates], up to and including consciousness, are not one thing and the expanse of reality another, and so on, up to and including conditioned and unconditioned phenomena, then, Venerable Lord, how would the ripening of positive and negative past actions be established and how would they become discernible? That is to say, the negative ripening of negative past actions causes sentient beings to become discernible in the hells, and the realms of anguished spirits and animals. The positive ripening of positive past actions causes them to become discernible in the god realms and the human realm. Similarly, the combined positive and negative ripening of combined positive and negative past actions causes them to become discernible among the animal realms and among human beings. Likewise, the neither positive nor negative ripening of neither positive nor negative past actions attains the fruit of entering the stream, the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth, the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth, arhatship, individual enlightenment, and unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2436}} The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, the systematic presentation of the [various] fruits may be disclosed when the relative truth is taken as the standard, but the systematic presentation of the fruits cannot be disclosed in ultimate truth. If you ask why, it is because in ultimate truth physical forms, and similarly, feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness are without arising, without cessation, without affliction, and without purification. This reality of the emptiness of the unlimited and the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end is non-conceptual and indescribable.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2437}} “Venerable Lord! If the systematic presentation of the fruits takes place dependent on the relative truth, would not all ordinary people attain the fruit of entering the stream, and similarly, would they not also attain the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth, the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth, arhatship, individual enlightenment, and unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2438}} The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, do ordinary people understand the relative truth and the ultimate truth? Rather, they lack the establishment of the fruit of entering the stream, and so on, up to and including unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. Su­bhūti, it is because ordinary people lack the noble eightfold path, do not cultivate the noble eightfold path, and lack the fruit of the noble eightfold path that they do not attain the establishment of the fruits. Rather, Su­bhūti, it is the sublime individuals who are endowed with the path to nirvāṇa, who cultivate the path to nirvāṇa, and possess the fruit of having cultivated the path to nirvāṇa. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because those sublime individuals themselves partake of the establishment of the fruits, while others do not.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2439}} Then Senior Su­bhūti asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! Is the fruit then attained when one has cultivated the path, or will one who has not cultivated the path attain the fruit?”
The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, the fruit is not attained even when one has cultivated the path, nor will one who has not cultivated the path attain the fruit. Nor, Su­bhūti, will the fruit be attained without cultivating the path. The fruit is not attained when one lacks the path, nor is it when one abides on the path. In this way, Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom may establish sentient beings in the fruit, but the fruit is not established by eradicating conditioned elements or unconditioned elements.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2440}} “Venerable Lord! If the fruit is not established by eradicating conditioned or unconditioned elements, yet has the Tathā­gata not revealed that the fruit of entering the stream is consequent on having renounced the three fetters, that the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth is consequent on having reduced the desires and malice associated with the world system of desire, that the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth is consequent on having renounced the five fetters associated with the lower realms [of desire], that arhatship is consequent on having renounced the five fetters associated with the higher realms [of form and formlessness], {{note:{index:417,id:UT22084-031-002-2441}}} that individual enlightenment is consequent on having understood that all things whatsoever originating from causes are things that will cease, and that unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment is consequent on having abandoned involuntary reincarnation through propensities and all afflicted mental states? How should I understand the Venerable Lord’s statement that the fruit is not established by eradicating conditioned and unconditioned phenomena?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2442}} The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, is the fruit of entering the stream, the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth, the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth, arhatship, individual enlightenment, or unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment conditioned or unconditioned?”
“Venerable Lord! All these phenomena are unconditioned.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2443}} The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, can unconditioned phenomena then be eradicated?”
“No, Venerable Lord!”

“No!, Venerable Lord!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2445}} The Blessed One continued, “Su­bhūti, the reason why great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom have nothing to eradicate is that they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings, owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena, and owing to the other aspects of emptiness, up to and including the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics. They themselves do not become fixated on anything at all, and they do not induce others to become fixated on anything at all. They do not become fixated on the transcendent perfection of generosity, or similarly [on the other transcendent perfections], up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom. They do not become fixated on the first meditative concentration [or on the other meditative concentrations], up to and including the fourth meditative concentration.

If you ask why, emptiness as a gateway to liberation implies that all things are empty of intrinsic defining characteristics. Signlessness as a gateway to liberation implies that they lack all signs, aspirationlessness as a gateway to liberation implies that they have abandoned all aspirations. Great bodhisattva beings who train in these three gateways to liberation undertake training while observing production and disintegration with respect to the five psycho-physical aggregates, and likewise, the twelve sense fields and the eighteen sensory elements.

If you ask how they correctly perceive physical forms, they see that physical forms are utterly porous or utterly fallacious, {{note:{index:420,id:UT22084-031-002-2461}}} just as a mass of foam is insubstantial.

It is the abiding nature of all things.

Therefore, great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom see that all things are empty of inherent existence, and they do not turn back from unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. If you ask why, it is because, in the emptiness of inherent existence, self, sentient beings, living creatures, lives, individuals, humankind, human beings, actors, agents, experiencers, experiencing subjects, knowers, and viewers are all non-apprehensible. Similarly, physical forms, feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness are non-apprehensible, and in the same vein, [all the causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighty minor marks, are non-apprehensible.

“No, Venerable Lord! If one were to ask why, it is because they are not entities.”

But even those great bodhisattva beings who, abiding in accordance with the exegeses imparted by the buddhas, have practiced in that manner and engaged in union with them, have not attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment.

If you ask why, Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings who are irreversible have entered upon the maturity of the bodhisattvas with respect to all phenomena, which are empty of intrinsic defining characteristics. They apprehend nothing at all, even to the extent of an indivisible atomic particle, and because they do not apprehend anything at all, they do not condition anything at all. Because they do not condition anything at all, they do not produce anything at all.

With regard to things that are equal to space, whose essential nature is non-entity and emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics, there is nothing apprehensible which would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood, by which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attained, and in which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attained. Since all these phenomena are equal to space, of the essential nature of non-entity, and empty of intrinsic defining characteristics, you will be afflicted and futile in your efforts to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, for such teaching is revealed to be the work of Māra.

Therefore I should don the armor that is equal to space, whose essential nature is non-entity and which is empty of intrinsic defining characteristics, to attain omniscience—manifestly perfect buddhahood—and reveal to sentient beings the sacred doctrine of emancipation from cyclic existence. I should establish them in the fruit of entering the stream, in the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth, in the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth, and in arhatship. I should establish them in individual enlightenment. I should establish them in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment.’ From the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment, great bodhisattva beings should be steadfast when listening to these sacred doctrines. Their minds should not be distracted. Their minds should not be captivated.

Similarly, they become absorbed in the four applications of mindfulness, and they become absorbed in [all the other causal attributes], up to and including the noble eightfold path.

Alas! On the contrary, this is Māra, or a man emanated by the evil Māra, who has approached me, encouraging me to acquire the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas!

If you ask why, it is because they think, ‘I will make offerings to the lord buddhas of the past, the future, and the present since they have acquired the sacred doctrine. I will also acquire their sacred doctrine.’ If you ask for the sake of which doctrine great bodhisattva beings relinquish even their lives—the doctrine that they will not relinquish—it is this: Su­bhūti, the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas teach that all phenomena are empty. Some foolish persons may contradict this and counterattack, saying, ‘This is not the sacred doctrine. This is not the Vinaya. This is not the teaching of the Teacher. This is not the path that progresses to perfect enlightenment!’ However, Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings relinquish even their lives for the sake of this sacred doctrine, thinking, ‘I too will be reckoned among the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas who will emerge in the future. I too will be foreordained to attain that. For the sake of this doctrine, I will relinquish even my life!’ Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings, considering this objective, relinquish even their own lives for the sake of the sacred doctrine.

Immediately after hearing those languages, sounds, terms, explanations, and statements they retain them and do not squander them.

If irreversible great bodhisattva beings are endowed with such enlightened attributes, what are the aspects of the path on which they abide and through which they then swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment? What is the enlightenment of the lord buddhas?” {{note:{index:433,id:UT22084-031-002-2598}}}
The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, the six transcendent perfections constitute the path of great bodhisattva beings. The thirty-seven aspects of enlightenment, the three gateways to liberation, the fourteen aspects of emptiness, the eight aspects of liberation, the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, and similarly, the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four assurances, and [all other fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, constitute the path of great bodhisattva beings.

Su­bhūti, there is nothing at all in which great bodhisattva beings should not train. If you ask why, it is because without training with respect to all phenomena and attributes, great bodhisattva beings cannot attain omniscience.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2600}} Senior Su­bhūti then asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! If all things are empty of inherent existence, how could great bodhisattva beings differentiate between attributes that are mundane or supramundane, contaminated or uncontaminated, conditioned or unconditioned, the attributes of ordinary people, the attributes of those who have entered the stream, the attributes of those who are tied to one more rebirth, the attributes of those who will no longer be subject to rebirth, the attributes of arhatship, or the attributes of individual enlightenment, up to and including the attributes of the genuinely perfect buddhas—knowing whence and whereby anything arises and what constitutes anything?” {{note:{index:434,id:UT22084-031-002-2601}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2602}} The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, it is so! It is just as you have spoken. All things are empty of inherent existence. Su­bhūti, if all things were apprehended not to be empty, great bodhisattva beings would not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. Su­bhūti, it is because all things are empty of inherent existence that great bodhisattva beings will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2603}} “Su­bhūti, you have said that if all things are empty of inherent existence, how could great bodhisattva beings differentiate between attributes that are mundane or supramundane, and so forth, up to and including the attributes of genuinely perfect buddhas–knowing whence and whereby anything arises and what constitutes anything. If, Su­bhūti, sentient beings knew that all things are empty of inherent existence, then great bodhisattva beings would not undertake training with respect to all things and attain omniscience. However, Su­bhūti, it is because sentient beings do not know that all things are empty that great bodhisattva beings do undertake training with respect to all things and attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, and that, after attaining buddhahood, they establish the sacred doctrine and teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2604}} “Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings should consider such matters at the outset by training in the bodhisattva path, thinking, ‘There is nothing but fixation. There is nothing at all that can be apprehended in terms of inherent existence. Since at this point I do not apprehend anything at all, having considered the inherent existence of all things, why should I be fixated on phenomena?’
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2605}} “Su­bhūti, when great bodhisattva beings at present consider the inherent existence of phenomena, they do not become fixated on anything at all, whether it be the six transcendent perfections, or the thirty-seven aspects of enlightenment, or the fruit of having entered the stream, the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth, the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth, arhatship, individual enlightenment, or unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. If you ask why, it is because they see that all things are empty of inherent existence, and emptiness does not become fixated on emptiness. Since they do not apprehend even emptiness, how could they possibly be fixated on emptiness! So it is, Su­bhūti, that great bodhisattva beings abide without fixation on anything.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2606}} “After undertaking and maintaining this training, they examine the conduct of all sentient beings. When the things in which those beings are engaged are examined, they are [seen to] be grasping at that which does not exist. Having seen those sentient beings engaging in grasping at that which does not exist, they further reflect, ‘These sentient beings will easily be freed from grasping at that which does not exist!’ Then, while maintaining the six transcendent perfections, through skill in means they turn sentient beings away from grasping at that which does not exist, and, having turned them away, encourage them toward the six attributes [of the transcendent perfections], {{note:{index:435,id:UT22084-031-002-2607}}} instructing them as follows: ‘O sentient beings! You should dispense generosity and you will not be without resources! You should not make assumptions on account of these resources. They lack even the slightest essence!

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2610}} “Teaching and instructing those sentient beings accordingly, the bodhisattvas continue to practice the path of enlightenment, and they do not become fixated on anything at all. If you ask why, it is because, owing to the emptiness of essential nature, they have no fixation on anything since all things lack any essential nature by which they would become fixated, upon which they would become fixated, or which would become fixated. Consequently, great bodhisattva beings practice the path of perfect enlightenment, but do not abide in anything at all. Indeed they abide in a non-abiding manner. They practice the transcendent perfection of generosity but they do not abide therein. Similarly, they practice the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of perseverance, the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration, and the transcendent perfection of wisdom, but they do not abide therein. They become equipoised in the first meditative concentration, but they do not abide therein. If you ask why, it is because [the first] meditative concentration is empty of its essential nature, while those who become absorbed in it are also empty, and the aspects [of it] through which they [become absorbed] are also empty. The same applies to [all the other meditative concentrations], up to and including the fourth meditative concentration.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2611}} “Similarly, they also become absorbed in loving kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity, but they do not abide therein. Similarly, they become absorbed in the four formless absorptions, the eight aspects of liberation, and the nine serial steps of meditative absorption, but they do not abide therein. Similarly, they attain the fruit of having entered the stream, but they do not abide therein. They attain [all the other fruits], up to and including arhatship, but they do not abide therein. Similarly, they attain individual enlightenment, but they do not abide therein. If you ask why, there are two reasons: those fruits are without essential nature, and they themselves are not satisfied merely by abiding therein. Indeed, they think, ‘I should not attain the fruit of entering the stream, and should avoid abiding in it. Similarly, I should not abide in [the other fruits], up to and including the level of the pratyekabuddhas!’ If you ask why, it is because they also think, ‘I will undoubtedly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. Those attributes [of the lower fruits] are indeed subsumed within it!’
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2612}} “So it is that great bodhisattva beings, from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment, never develop any thoughts whatsoever apart from the mind of unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. From the first [bodhisattva] level up to the tenth [bodhisattva] level it is the same—they exclusively maintain the mind of unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings who, without distraction, advance courageously through body, speech, and mind as appropriate are at all times accompanied by the mind set on enlightenment. Abiding in this mind set on enlightenment, they are undistracted on the path of enlightenment.”

The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti! Enlightenment will not be attained by means of the path, nor will it be attained by means of that which is not the path. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because enlightenment itself is the path and the path itself is enlightenment.”

The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, do you think that the buddhas attain enlightenment?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2618}} “No, Venerable Lord! If one were to ask why, it is because the lord buddhas are themselves enlightenment, and enlightenment is itself the buddhas.”

The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment, and until their final rebirth, great bodhisattva beings purify the negativity of others, including their negativity of body, their negativity of speech, and their negativity of mind.”

The Blessed One replied, “The killing of living creatures, the stealing of what is not given, and sexual misconduct due to desire constitute the negativity of body. Lying, slander, verbal abuse, and irresponsible chatter constitute the negativity of speech. Covetousness, malice, and wrong views constitute the negativity of mind.

Will they be stable in the community of the śrāvakas, or will they be stable in the community of pratyekabuddhas? Venerable Lord! In which community will they be stable?”
The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings will not be stable in the community of śrāvakas. They will not be stable in the community of pratyekabuddhas, but, Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings will be stable in the community of the genuinely perfect buddhas.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2647}} “Venerable Lord! Are those great bodhisattva beings who have first begun to set their mind on enlightenment said to be stable, or are those [ irreversible bodhisattvas ] in their final rebirth stable?”
The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, those great bodhisattva beings who have first begun to set their mind on enlightenment are indeed stable. Those [bodhisattvas] who are irreversible and those in their final rebirth are also stable.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2648}} “Venerable Lord! Will great bodhisattva beings who are stable in their intent on genuine reality be reborn among the denizens of the hells?”
The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, do you think that one who is on the eighth [level], one who has entered the stream, one who is tied to one more rebirth, one who is no longer subject to rebirth, one who has attained arhatship, or individual enlightenment, will be reborn in the inferior realms?”
No, Venerable Lord!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2649}} The Blessed One replied, “Similarly, Su­bhūti, it is impossible that great bodhisattva beings who, from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment, practice the transcendent perfection of generosity, and similarly maintain ethical discipline, practice tolerance, undertake perseverance with respect to [the acquisition of] virtuous attributes, become absorbed in the meditative concentrations, cultivate wisdom, and have abandoned all non-virtuous attributes, and remain firm, should be reborn in the inferior realms or be reborn among long-lived gods! It is impossible that they should be reborn among frontier tribesmen who do not engage in virtuous acts, or among barbarous human beings, or to be reborn among households or frontier tribesmen who maintain wrong views, where the four assemblies—that is to say, the assembly of fully ordained monks, the assembly of fully ordained nuns, the assembly of laymen, and the assembly of laywomen—are not found! It is impossible for them to be reborn in places where the word ‘Buddha,’ the word ‘Dharma,’ and the word ‘Saṅgha’ are unheard, or where the words ‘inaction’ and ‘wrong view’ are heard! Su­bhūti, it is impossible that great bodhisattva beings, who have first begun to set their mind on enlightenment, after entering upon the unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment with higher aspiration, should adopt the ways of the ten non-virtuous actions!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2651}} Then Senior Su­bhūti asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! If great bodhisattva beings are endowed with many roots of virtue, why are they reborn in the animal realms, and why does the Tathā­gata disclose his own past lives in the presence of the four assemblies? Where did those roots of virtue go?”
The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings do not assume a body that will be reborn in the animal realms due to non-virtuous past actions, but they assume a corporeal form by which they might be causally effective in order to benefit sentient beings. Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings are endowed with skill in means whereby they may take birth in the animal realms, and mingle with assassins. Do śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have this skill in means, which would enable them also to bring those [creatures] and themselves to maturity in the unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, and make those assassins cease from causing further harm? For these reasons, Su­bhūti, great bodhisattva beings who are seized by great compassion, bring great compassion to its fulfilment. Even though they are born in the animal realms, for the sake of sentient beings, you should know that they are untainted by the defects of taking birth in the animal realms.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2652}} Then Senior Su­bhūti asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! Maintaining which virtuous attributes do great bodhisattva beings acquire corporeal forms that take birth in the animal realms?”
The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, if you ask what are the attributes to be perfected by great bodhisattva beings, Su­bhūti, the unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment is the perfection of all virtuous attributes. Therefore, Su­bhūti, there is no virtuous attribute at all which should not be perfected by great bodhisattva beings, commencing exclusively from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they are seated at the Focal Point of Enlightenment. It is impossible for them to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, while any of these are unperfected. So it is, Su­bhūti, that, from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they are seated at the Focal Point of Enlightenment, great bodhisattva beings should train in the perfection of all virtuous attributes. When they have trained therein, they will attain omniscience. They will abandon all afflicted mental states, and all involuntary reincarnation through propensities.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2653}} Then Senior Su­bhūti asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! How are great bodhisattva beings, starting from those who possess all positive attributes and continuing as far as those who possess sublime pristine cognition, born in the inferior realms?”
The Blessed One replied to Senior Su­bhūti as follows: “Su­bhūti, do you think that the tathāgatas are sublime and without contaminants?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2654}} “Yes, Venerable Lord, it is so! Venerable Su­gata, it is so! The tathāgatas are sublime and they are without contaminants.”
The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, do you think that the tathāgatas may emanate an animal body that takes birth among the animal realms, and having emanated [that form], then engage in buddha activities?”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2655}} “Yes, Venerable Lord, they may do so!”

“No, Venerable Lord!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2656}} The Blessed One replied, “Similarly, Su­bhūti, even great bodhisattva beings who possess the uncontaminated pristine cognition of the sublime path may, in order to bring sentient beings to maturity, assume at will such corporeal forms by which they might bring to maturity any kind of sentient beings among the five classes of living beings. Su­bhūti, do you think, for example, that an arhat can emanate as an arhat whose contaminants have ceased, and having emanated [that form] then induce it to undertake the activities of an arhat, whereupon it would bring joy to the four assemblies through these activities?” {{note:{index:440,id:UT22084-031-002-2657}}}
“Yes, Venerable Lord, it is so!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2658}} The Blessed One replied, “Similarly, Su­bhūti, even great bodhisattva beings who possess sublime, uncontaminated pristine cognition may assume such corporeal forms by which they might act on behalf of sentient beings. Those who have assumed such forms do not at all experience sufferings, and they are untainted also by the corresponding defects.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2659}} “Su­bhūti, do you think that when an illusionist or the skilled apprentice of an illusionist conjures the form of an elephant in the presence of a crowd of simple folk, or when he conjures the form of a horse or the form of a bull, or when he conjures other forms of living creatures—do you think, Su­bhūti, that those forms conjured by the illusionist or the skilled apprentice of an illusionist actually turn into an elephant, or that they turn into a horse, bull, or another living creature?”
“No, Venerable Lord!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2660}} The Blessed One replied, “Similarly, Su­bhūti, even though great bodhisattva beings who possess sublime, uncontaminated pristine cognition may reveal such corporeal forms at will, acting on behalf of sentient beings, they are indeed untainted by the feelings that they possess.”

Since great bodhisattva beings, who possess sublime, uncontaminated pristine cognition, and who may assume this or that corporeal form by which they are capable of acting on behalf of sentient beings, are greatly skilled in means, Venerable Lord, in which [pure] attributes {{note:{index:441,id:UT22084-031-002-2662}}} do great bodhisattva beings abide when they then employ such skill in means?”
The Blessed One replied, “Su­bhūti, they abide in the transcendent perfection of wisdom when they employ such skillful means. Through this skill in means, though they may traverse all the world systems in the ten directions, numerous as the sands of the River Ganges, and then act on behalf of those sentient beings, they do not hanker for them. If you ask why, it is because they do not apprehend anything at all by which or for which they would hanker. If you ask why, Su­bhūti, it is because all things are empty of their essential nature, emptiness does not hanker, and there is no one who hankers for emptiness. If you ask why, it is because emptiness does not apprehend emptiness. This, Su­bhūti, is the emptiness of non-apprehension. Abiding therein, great bodhisattva beings will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment.”

Indeed, Ānanda, even the other five transcendent perfections, which have received the name ‘transcendent perfection,’ originate from this [transcendent perfection of wisdom], and even the omniscience that the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas have attains its emancipation through this [transcendent perfection of wisdom].

All sentient beings, too, would sequentially attain final nirvāṇa by means of any vehicle whatsoever among the three vehicles. Therefore, Ānanda, this transcendent perfection of wisdom is most important because through it the sentient beings of the world systems of the great trichiliocosm become established in accordance with the deeds of the buddhas. Ānanda, you should know that the attainment of buddhahood occurs in whichever world system the transcendent perfection of wisdom prevails.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2704}} “Ānanda, it resembles, for example, a priceless gemstone which is endowed with the following attributes: No matter where this precious gemstone is placed, no human being seeking to intrude [and cause harm] would have a chance. When this precious gemstone is set in a place where men or women are possessed by non-human spirits, the non-human spirits would themselves swiftly depart because they would be unable to stand the brilliance of this precious gemstone. Similarly, when this precious gemstone is attached to the body of an invalid suffering from bile disorders, the bile disorders will be alleviated. Similarly, when this precious gemstone is attached to the body of a man or woman who is afflicted by wind disorders, or a man or woman afflicted by phlegm disorders or combined humoral disorders, immediately on touching it the ailments would be alleviated by the brilliance of this precious gemstone. Furthermore, this precious gemstone would illuminate the night. In the hot season, any location in which this precious gemstone is placed would become cool, and in the cold season any location in which this precious gemstone is placed would become warm. In any location where there are poisonous snakes or scorpions, and some man or woman were bitten by a poisonous snake [or scorpion], on being shown this precious gemstone, immediately after seeing it their poison would vanish. Ānanda, this precious gemstone would be endowed with such attributes.

If this precious gemstone were immersed in a pool of water, all the water would come to possess the eight qualities [of pure water]. If it were wrapped in blue, yellow, red, white, purple, crystal, reddish yellow, or pale yellow cloth and then immersed in water, all the water would become identical in color—blue and so forth, up to pale yellow. Ānanda, if this precious gemstone were immersed in turbid water, the water would become clear.

The Blessed One replied to Senior Ānanda as follows: “Ānanda, this precious gemstone indeed exists among the gods. This precious gemstone indeed exists among the human beings of Jambu­dvīpa. However, the precious gemstone that exists among the human beings of Jambu­dvīpa has few attributes, whereas the precious gemstone that exists among the god realms has immeasurable attributes.

[The aspects of emptiness], from the emptiness of internal phenomena up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities, also resemble this [precious gemstone]. [The causal and fruitional attributes], from the four applications of mindfulness up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, and all the attributes of reality, the abiding nature, the real nature, the finality of existence, and the inconceivable expanse, also resemble this [precious gemstone].

If you ask why, it is because they are the repositories of the six transcendent perfections. In the same vein as before, the tathāgatas accept the offerings because they are the repositories [of the causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, and of the pristine cognition of omniscience , great compassion, and great loving kindness. Similarly, they accept the offerings because they are the repositories of the transcendent perfections, in whom afflicted mental states and all involuntary reincarnation through propensities have been abandoned, and who likewise are without affliction or purification, without arising or ceasing, without acceptance or rejection, and without standing, sitting, going, coming, or abiding.

Having transcended the levels of the śrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhas, they will enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas, and also attain the extrasensory powers of the bodhisattvas. Through these extrasensory powers of the bodhisattvas they will travel from buddhafield to buddhafield, and acquire a corporeal form through which they will refine the buddhafields and bring sentient beings to maturity.

It is thus that they perfect the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline. This same transcendent perfection of wisdom has primacy for those great bodhisattva beings who practice tolerance.

{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2742}} “Moreover, Ānanda, if any sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage were to establish the sentient beings of Jambu­dvīpa, as many as they are, in the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth, in the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth, in arhatship, and in individual enlightenment, in your opinion , Ānanda, would those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage accrue much merit on that basis?”
“Yes, they would, Venerable Lord! Yes, they would, Venerable Su­gata!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2743}} The Blessed One replied, “Ānanda, if any sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage were to extensively describe, explain, genuinely demonstrate, and so forth, these noble meanings and noble words of the transcendent perfection of wisdom to others, saying, ‘Come! Child of enlightened heritage, you should retain this transcendent perfection of wisdom, and so forth. You should earnestly apply this transcendent perfection of wisdom, as it has been taught!’ they would have much greater merit than those [who establish sentient beings in those fruits]. If you ask why, Ānanda, it is because [those fruits], up to and including individual enlightenment, are distinguished through this transcendent perfection of wisdom. The same goes for all the sentient beings of the world systems of the ten directions, as many as the sands of the River Ganges.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2744}} “Moreover, Ānanda, if any sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage were to encourage all the sentient beings of Jambu­dvīpa, numerous as the sands of the River Ganges, to acquire unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, and then were to extensively teach, explain, analyze, elucidate, and genuinely demonstrate these noble meanings and noble words of the transcendent perfection of wisdom to others, saying, ‘Come! Child of enlightened heritage, you should train in this transcendent perfection of wisdom, and when you have trained therein, you will attain the attributes of omniscience,’ their merit would be equivalent. If you ask why, Ānanda, it is because all great bodhisattva beings in the world systems of the ten directions, as many as they are, from those who have first begun to set their mind on enlightenment and continuing as far as those who abide on the tenth level, will attain emancipation through this transcendent perfection of wisdom. The same goes for all the world systems of the ten directions, as many as the sands of the River Ganges.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2745}} “Moreover, Ānanda, if any sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage were to establish all the sentient beings of Jambu­dvīpa, as many as they are, on the irreversible level , in your opinion, Ānanda, would those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage accrue much merit on that basis?” {{note:{index:461,id:UT22084-031-002-2746}}}
“Yes, they would, Venerable Lord! Yes, they would, Venerable Su­gata!”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2747}} The Blessed One replied, “Ānanda, if any sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage were to extensively describe, genuinely demonstrate, and so forth, these noble meanings and noble words of the transcendent perfection of wisdom to others, saying, ‘Come! Child of enlightened heritage, you should retain this transcendent perfection of wisdom, and so forth. You should earnestly apply this transcendent perfection of wisdom, as it has been taught! Child of enlightened heritage, when you have trained in this transcendent perfection of wisdom, as it has been taught, you will attain the attributes of omniscience, and at that time, you will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment,’ in that case, their merit would be much greater than that. If you ask why, Ānanda, it is because the irreversible level of great bodhisattva beings and the [other attainments], up to and including unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, have also originated from the transcendent perfection of wisdom. The same goes for all the world systems of the ten directions, as many as they are, numerous as the sands of the River Ganges.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2748}} “Moreover, Ānanda, if, on the one hand, some sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage were to encourage all the sentient beings of Jambu­dvīpa, as many as they are, to acquire unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, and then were to describe, genuinely demonstrate, and so forth, these noble meanings and noble words of the transcendent perfection of wisdom to them, saying, ‘Come! Child of enlightened heritage, you should retain this transcendent perfection of wisdom, and so forth. You should earnestly apply this transcendent perfection of wisdom, as it has been taught! When you have earnestly applied the transcendent perfection of wisdom, as it has been taught, you will train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom. When you have trained in the transcendent perfection of wisdom, you will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment,’ and if, on the other hand, someone were to teach, genuinely demonstrate, and so forth, this transcendent perfection of wisdom to those irreversible bodhisattvas , saying, ‘Come! Child of enlightened heritage, you should retain this transcendent perfection of wisdom, and so forth. You should earnestly apply this transcendent perfection of wisdom, as it has been taught! When you have earnestly applied it, you will gradually attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment,’ in that case, the latter would have much greater merit than the former. The same goes extensively for all the world systems of the ten directions, numerous as the sands of the River Ganges.

If you ask why, it is because the irreversible great bodhisattva beings do not require even a single demonstration of the sacred doctrine—they are intent on perfect enlightenment and cannot be averted from unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, whereas this one should be embraced because he or she is distressed [at the sufferings of beings] in cyclic existence, and engages in [acts of] great compassion.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2750}} Then Senior Ānanda said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! The more great bodhisattva beings approach unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, the more they wish to teach and grant instruction in the transcendent perfection of generosity, and similarly, the more they wish to teach and grant instruction in the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of perseverance, the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration, and the transcendent perfection of wisdom, and similarly, the more they wish to teach and grant instruction in [the aspects of emptiness], from the emptiness of internal phenomena up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of non-entities, and similarly, the more they wish to teach and grant instruction in [the causal attributes], from the four applications of mindfulness up to and including the noble eightfold path, and similarly, the more they wish to teach and grant instruction in the ten powers of the tathāgatas, the four assurances, the four unhindered discernments, great loving kindness, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, and the more they wish to benefit sentient beings with food, clothing, bedding, mats, medications which cure ailments, and [other] useful resources. The sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who would benefit those bodhisattvas, attracting them with the sacred doctrine and attracting them with worldly needs, accrue much greater merit than the aforementioned sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who do not. If one were to ask why, Venerable Lord, it is because I consider that those great bodhisattva beings who teach and grant instruction in the transcendent perfection of generosity, and similarly, who teach and grant instruction in the other transcendent perfections, up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom, have much greater merit.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2751}} Then, the Blessed One replied to Senior Ānanda as follows: “Ānanda, you who encourage the sons of enlightened heritage or the daughters of enlightened heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas. Well done! The sublime śrāvakas who wish to benefit sentient beings should encourage great bodhisattva beings who would attain unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. They should assist and protect great bodhisattva beings, attracting them with the sacred doctrine and attracting them with worldly needs. If you ask why, it is because the monastic community of the śrāvakas of the tathāgatas originated from the bodhisattvas, while the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas also originated from them, and the Great Vehicle also originated from them. {{note:{index:462,id:UT22084-031-002-2752}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2753}} “Ānanda, if bodhisattvas did not develop the mind set on unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, great bodhisattva beings would not train in the six transcendent perfections. If they did not train in [the causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, they would not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment because they would not have trained in the six transcendent perfections and the [other causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas. If they did not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, there would be no unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment, or the enlightenment of the pratyekabuddhas, or the enlightenment of the śrāvakas. Ānanda, it is because the bodhisattvas train in the six transcendent perfections and in [the other causal and fruitional attributes], up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, that great bodhisattva beings who would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment will actually attain manifestly perfect buddhahood.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2754}} Then Senior Ānanda said to the Blessed One, “Venerable Lord! As I understand the teaching spoken by the Lord, as long as this transcendent perfection of wisdom is active in the world, Venerable Lord, the Precious Jewel of the Buddha, the Precious Jewel of the Dharma, and the Precious Jewel of the Saṅgha will not vanish from the world. Likewise, so long will the paths of the ten virtuous actions emerge in the world. So long will the four meditative concentrations, and similarly, the four immeasurable aspirations and the four formless absorptions emerge in the world. So long will the transcendent perfection of generosity, the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline, the transcendent perfection of tolerance, the transcendent perfection of perseverance, and the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration emerge in the world. So long will [the causal and fruitional attributes], from the four applications of mindfulness up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas, emerge in the world. Likewise, so long will the understanding of all phenomena and the understanding of the aspects of the path emerge in the world. Likewise, so long will the royal class, like a tall sāl tree; the priestly class, like a tall sāl tree; and the householder class, like a tall sāl tree, emerge in the world. Likewise, so long will the gods of the Catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm emerge in the world. Likewise, so long will the gods of [all the other realms], up to and including Akaniṣṭha, emerge in the world. Likewise, so long will those who have entered the stream, those who are tied to one more rebirth, those who are no longer subject to rebirth, as well as arhats, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas, all emerge in the world. So long, subsequently, will the pristine cognitions of buddhahood emerge in the world. So long will the maturation of sentient beings and the refinement of the buddhafields, and so forth, emerge in the world. So long will all non-virtuous attributes be diminished. So long will all virtuous attributes that should be cultivated be perfected. So long will the god realms be enhanced and the antigod realms be diminished. So long will the way of the buddhas not be interrupted, and so long will the way of the sacred doctrine and the way of the saṅgha not be interrupted. So long will the promulgations of the doctrinal wheel, and so forth, emerge in the world.”
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2755}} The Blessed One replied, “Ānanda, it is so! You have spoken correctly. As long as the transcendent perfection of wisdom is active in the world, so long will the Precious Jewel of the Buddha not vanish from the world, and in the same vein, so long will [all those other attributes], up to and including the promulgation of the doctrinal wheel, emerge in the world. If you ask why, Ānanda, it is because this transcendent perfection of wisdom is of great benefit, even when heard only minimally, let alone when it is retained, held, recited, mastered, and attended to correctly, that is to say, honored, venerated, respected, and presented with offerings of flowers, fruits, perfume, unguents, powders, incense, butter lamps , parasols, victory banners, ribbons and diverse musical sounds! {{note:{index:463,id:UT22084-031-002-2756}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2757}} “If you ask why, Ānanda, it is because all those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage, and the male and female gods, whose ears have heard this transcendent perfection of wisdom, will, on the basis of this very root of virtue, attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment. If you ask why, Ānanda, it is because the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas who emerged in the past, along with their monastic assemblies of śrāvakas, indeed attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment and passed into final nirvāṇa, in the expanse beyond sorrow, where there is no residue of the psycho-physical aggregates, having trained in this very transcendent perfection of wisdom.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2758}} “Also, the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas who will emerge in the future, along with their monastic assemblies of śrāvakas, will all attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed, genuinely perfect enlightenment and pass into final nirvāṇa, in the expanse beyond sorrow, where there is no residue of the psycho-physical aggregates, having trained in this very transcendent perfection of wisdom.

If you ask why, Ānanda, it is because all the attributes of the aspects of enlightenment are gathered in the transcendent perfection of wisdom. All the attributes of the buddhas, the attributes of the pratyekabuddhas, and the attributes of the śrāvakas are also gathered therein. All virtuous attributes are indeed attained therein, and all things are subsumed therein.
{{milestone:UT22084-031-002-2760}} “Moreover, Ānanda, you have revered me with benevolent actions of body, benevolent actions of speech, and benevolent actions of mind. So it is that you have rejoiced in, had confidence in, and paid homage to this, my physical body, while I am alive and present, here and now. But after I have passed away, you should rejoice, have faith in, and pay homage to this transcendent perfection of wisdom. Ānanda, after I have passed into final nirvāṇa, in any event, you should not squander this transcendent perfection of wisdom. After I have passed into final nirvāṇa, in any event, I shall entrust it to your hands, twice or thrice, so that not even a single syllable will vanish. Ānanda, you should know that, for as long as this transcendent perfection of wisdom is active in the world, so long will the tathāgatas reside in the world. You should know that so long will the tathāgatas teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings in the world. Ānanda, you should know that so long will sentient beings behold the tathāgatas, and inseparably hear the sacred doctrine from the tathāgatas. You should know that so long will renunciate modes of conduct be maintained in the presence of the tathāgatas. So long will beings listen to this transcendent perfection of wisdom, so long will they commit it to writing or have it committed to writing, and master, describe, retain, hold, recite, teach, and be attentive to it in the correct manner—honoring, venerating, respecting, making offerings, and praising it with flowers, garlands, perfume, unguents, incense, butter lamps , powders, butter, oil, lamps, robes, parasols, victory banners, ribbons, and many other useful necessities of offering.”
