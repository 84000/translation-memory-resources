The Root Manual of the Rites of Mañjuśrī
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-25}} {{page:{number:1,folio:F.105.a}}} {{note:{index:8,id:UT22084-088-038-17927}}} Oṁ , homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas!
Thus did I hear at one time. Lord Śākyamuni dwelt above the Pure Abode, in an inconceivable, wondrous pavilion, circular in shape, with a congregation of bodhisattvas {{note:{index:9,id:UT22084-088-038-27}}} distributed all around, located in the canopy of the sky. There the Lord addressed the gods of the Pure Abode: {1.1}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-28}} “Honored gods! Listen as I tell of the inconceivable, wondrous miracles of Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, bodhisattva, and great being—listen as I tell of his conduct, different types of samādhi, and magical power; his liberation, maṇḍala, and his miraculous bodhisattva manifestations; and how he is the sustenance for all beings and brings them life, health, and sovereignty! I will explain, for the benefit of all beings, the mantra subjects that completely fulfill one’s wishes. Listen well and duly reflect upon it—I will now tell you about him.” {1.2}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-29}} Thereupon the gods of the Pure Abode, folding their hands, said: {{note:{index:10,id:UT22084-088-038-30}}}
“Then tell us, Lord, about the conduct of the bodhisattvas; their different samādhis and their attainment of the bodhisattva levels; their sitting upon the vajra throne, overpowering of Māra , and turning of the wheel of Dharma; their liberating of all śrāvakas and pratyeka­buddhas; their ensuring for all beings rebirth as a god or a human and the pacification of all suffering; their removal of diseases of the poor, sick, and wealthy alike; their invulnerability to the use of all mundane and supramundane mantras; and their fulfilling of all wishes that thus makes the speech of all the tathāgatas fruitful. {{note:{index:11,id:UT22084-088-038-32}}} Lord, speak with a mind full of love and concern for our welfare, {{page:{number:2,folio:F.105.b}}} and out of pity for all sentient beings.” {1.3}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-33}} Then Lord Śākyamuni, casting a glance with his buddha eye over the entire realm of the Pure Abode, entered the samādhi called the spreading and diffusing of the light of the pure sphere. {{note:{index:12,id:UT22084-088-038-34}}} As soon as the Lord entered this samādhi, out of his ūrṇā came an array of light rays called arouser of the bodhisattva Saṃkusumita; {{note:{index:13,id:UT22084-088-038-35}}} he was surrounded by many hundreds of thousands of millions of rays. The light circumambulated the Buddha three times and, having passed through billions of trichiliocosms and crossed as many worlds in the northeastern direction as there are grains of sand in one hundred thousand Gaṅgā rivers, it came to the world sphere called Kusumāvatī, where the tathāgata Saṃkusumita Rājendra was staying. Due to the power of his previous aspirations, Mañjuśrī was also staying there together with other bodhisattvas, great beings engaged in bodhisattva activity. Seeing this effulgence of light, he gently smiled and addressed the multitude of bodhisattvas: {1.4}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-36}} “This arousing ray of light, O sons of the victorious ones, has come here to wake me up. Do pay attention!” {1.5}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-37}} Then Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, the bodhisattva, the great being, with his eyes wide and unblinking, sat facing the radiance of the ray. And this arousing ray, illuminating the Kusumāvatī world sphere with great radiance, circumambulated the thus-gone lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra clockwise three times and dissolved into the head of the great being, the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī. {1.6}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-38}} The divine youth Mañjuśrī then got up from his seat {{page:{number:3,folio:F.106.a}}} and circumambulated the thus-gone lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra three times. Then, bowing his head and placing his right knee on the ground, he spoke to Lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra: {1.7}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-39}} “May Lord Śākyamuni, the tathāgata, the arhat, the completely awakened one, think of me. Let me go, O lord, from here to the Sahā world sphere to see Lord Śākyamuni, to honor him and serve him. Let me go so that he may instruct me in the mantra practice, the sādhana practice, and the procedure of constructing the right maṇḍala; the secrets of the ritual and the procedure of drawing the picture; and the secret mudrā empowerment into the heart of all the tathāgatas, so that all the wishes of all beings are fulfilled.” {1.8} {{note:{index:14,id:UT22084-088-038-40}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-41}} Being so addressed, the thus-gone lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra said this to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:
“You may go, divine youth Mañjuśrī, if you think that this is the right time. And please ask Lord Śākyamuni, on my behalf, if he is without pain and without worry, if his efforts come easily to him, and if his life is comfortable.” {1.9}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-43}} Then, the thus-gone lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra {{page:{number:4,folio:F.107.a}}} {{note:{index:15,id:UT22084-088-038-44}}} further said this to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:
“Also, O divine youth, the tathāgatas, the arhats, the completely awakened ones, numerous as grains of sand in one hundred thousand Gaṅgā rivers, have taught and will teach again of your proficiency in mantra practice, maṇḍala ritual, the secret empowerment, the mudrās, the picture drawing procedure, the homa rite, the mantra recitation, and the regular observations, all of which fulfill every wish and bring joy to every being. They will teach of your proficiency in the vast fields of astrology and gemology; of your knowledge of the past, present, and future; and of your ability to govern and make predictions. They will teach of your mantra repetition, your ability to travel to the ends of the earth and to become invisible, and your vast knowledge of the right time and occasion for anything. They will teach how to traverse all the stages of the buddhas, bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, and pratyeka­buddhas, and all the mundane and supramundane stages without exception. They will teach the way in which you are established in the practice of all of these. So that I too may rejoice, please go Mañjuśrī, O divine youth, if you think that the time is right. You will hear these teachings in the presence of Śākyamuni, face to face with him, and you will later give them yourself. The mantra for this is as follows: {1.10}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-46}} “Homage to all the tathāgatas whose instructions are inconceivable and perfect!
“ Oṁ, ra ra ! Do remember! O perfect teacher possessing the form of a divine youth! Hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ phaṭ! Svāhā! {{note:{index:16,id:UT22084-088-038-48}}} {1.11}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-49}} “This was, O divine youth Mañjuśrī, the root mantra. It is the heart essence of all the tathāgatas, and it was and will be {{note:{index:17,id:UT22084-088-038-50}}} recited by them. You will also now recite this, the all-accomplishing mantra, together with all its parts, having arrived in the Sahā world. This has been sanctioned by Śākyamuni. Here, the ultimate heart mantra is:
“ Oṁ , this [mantra] is [my] homage to speech! {{note:{index:18,id:UT22084-088-038-52}}} {1.12}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-53}} “The subsidiary heart mantra in this set is:
“ Speech, hūṁ!” {{note:{index:19,id:UT22084-088-038-55}}} {1.13}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-56}} Lord Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, being thus granted leave by Saṃkusumita Rājendra, {{page:{number:5,folio:F.107.b}}} the tathāgata, entered the samādhi called the ornament of all supernal manifestations that brings the attainment of the essence of awakening which is a product of the conduct of a bodhisattva . As soon as Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, entered this samādhi, the world sphere with all its directions—above, below, and across—up to its farthest reaches, became filled with lord buddhas. Saṃkusumita Rājendra then said: {1.14}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-57}} “Good, good it is, O son of the Victorious One, that you have entered this particular samādhi! No śrāvakas, pratyeka­buddhas, or bodhisattvas who are established in the perfect conduct, not even those on the tenth bodhisattva level, are able to enter this samādhi.” {1.15}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-58}} Then Saṃkusumita Rājendra, having conferred with the lord buddhas, the tathāgatas, taught the following mantra of Mañjuśrī, the divine youth—his ultimately secret, innermost heart essence that accomplishes all purposes. This most secret, divine mantra, called One Syllable, {{note:{index:20,id:UT22084-088-038-59}}} {{page:{number:6,folio:F.106.b}}} which serves the interests of all beings, is also fit to accomplish the special mantra practice. {{note:{index:21,id:UT22084-088-038-60}}} {1.16}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-61}} Lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra, the tathāgata, became quiet for a moment. Looking with his buddha eye over all the world spheres, he considered all the lord buddhas dwelling there, and with a mind filled with love, pronounced the mantra: {{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-088-038-62}}}
“Homage to all the buddhas!
“ Oṁ maṁ !” {{note:{index:23,id:UT22084-088-038-65}}}
“This mantra is the ultimate heart essence of Mañjuśrī, which accomplishes all endeavors.” {1.17}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-67}} Then Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, arose from the aforementioned samādhi and performed, in the time that it takes a strong person to bend or to extend their arm, or to snap their fingers, or to close and open their eyes, the miraculous, special samādhi called the intellect with the force of magical power , and went to the Sahā world. Having arrived there, he established himself in the palace of the gods of the Pure Abode founded upon fine jewels and gems in the canopy of the sky. Illuminating this entire realm of the Pure Abode with powerful rays of light, he entered the samādhi called the illuminator adorned with brilliant jewels. {1.18}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-68}} As soon as Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, entered this samādhi, he manifested through the power of bodhisattva transformation, for the worship of Lord Śākyamuni, a divinely created palace sumptuously studded with many gems and adorned with jeweled parasols spanning many hundred of thousands of leagues; bedecked with divinely beautiful great bundles of silk streamers; decorated with celestial flowers, banners, flags, garlands, and jewels; and pleasant with the sweet sound of draperies of latticed wind-chimes. Also, in the act of worshiping Lord Śākyamuni, he manifested a copious rain of perfume, garlands, ointments, wreaths, and scented powders. {1.19}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-69}} Seeing this extraordinary and marvelous display—a miracle of a bodhisattva—the hair of the gods of the Pure Abode stood on end in excitement. When, however, they saw their abodes trembling, their hearts became tormented and pained. They immediately began to wail loudly, with a sense of great urgency, “Oh, what can this be? Could it be that we are being deprived of our divine powers?” And they implored, “Please protect us, Lord! Please protect us, Śākyamuni!” {1.20}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-70}} Lord Śākyamuni then addressed the entire assembly of the gods of the Pure Abode:
“Do not be afraid, friends! Do not be afraid! Mañjuśrī, the divine youth present here, the bodhisattva, the great being, has come here from the presence of the tathāgata Saṃkusumita Rājendra in the buddhafield Saṃkusumita , in order to see, worship, and serve me. He has come to teach the conduct of great purpose, the mantra subjects, and the vast and amazing Dharma subjects.” {1.21}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-72}} The divine youth Mañjuśrī, in turn, circumambulated Lord Śākyamuni three times and, looking at him with unblinking eyes, bowed down to his feet and praised him with these succinct words: {1.22}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-73}} “Homage to you, the liberated one not subject to birth! Homage to you, the best among men! Homage to you, the elder of men, Who accomplishes all purposes of [mantra] {{note:{index:24,id:UT22084-088-038-74}}} conduct! {1.23}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-75}} “Homage to you, O lion of a man, Who prevents anything undesirable from occurring! Homage to you, the great hero Who eliminates all evil destinies! {1.24}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-76}} “Homage to you, {{page:{number:7,folio:F.108.a}}} white lotus of a man, Who is fragrant with the scent of merit! Homage to you, O lotus of a man, Who purifies the mire of the three types of existence! {1.25}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-77}} “Homage to you, O liberated one, Who delivers from all pain! Homage to you, the tranquil one Who perfectly tames all the untamed ones! {1.26}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-78}} “Homage to you, the accomplished one Who fulfills the purpose of all mantra practice! Homage to you, the auspicious one, The most auspicious among all auspicious! {1.27}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-79}} “Homage to you, the awakened one Who awakens others to the complete truth of the Dharma! Homage to you, the tathāgata, The one who abides in and teaches The suchness of all phenomena, Which is devoid of conceptual elaboration! {1.28}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-80}} “Homage to the omniscient one who is established, and is establishing others, in nirvāṇa and in the path of the three vehicles that encompasses all consciousnesses and all knowable objects, both conditioned and unconditioned!” {1.29}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-81}} Having praised Lord Śākyamuni in his presence with these words, Mañjuśrī said:
“There is, O lord, in the eastern direction beyond world spheres as numerous as the grains of sand in one hundred thousand Gaṅgā rivers, a buddhafield called Saṃkusumita . There is a world sphere there called Kusumāvatī where the tathāgata Lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra dwells. An arhat, one perfectly awakened, perfected in wisdom and conduct, the bliss-gone one, the supreme knower of the world, the guide of people who need to be tamed, the preceptor of gods and men , he expounds the Dharma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. He presented an account of the buddha activity {{note:{index:25,id:UT22084-088-038-83}}} that is profoundly meaningful, full of beautiful figures of speech, original, complete, perfectly pure, and highly polished. He is presently living and teaching all sentient beings the Dharma, the bodhisattva basket {{note:{index:26,id:UT22084-088-038-84}}} that pertains to the mantra practice, {{page:{number:8,folio:F.108.b}}} the path that conforms to the practice of the threefold path, the protection, the place of rest, the refuge, the highest aim, the well-being, and the ultimate and final cessation. It is by his command that I have arrived here in your presence, to be at your feet. Lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra, the tathāgata, asks if you are without pain and without worry, if your efforts come easily to you, and if your life is comfortable. He also said this: {1.30}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-85}} “ ‘It is indeed wonderful that in this time of the five degenerations Lord Śākyamuni, the awakened one, has appeared and is giving complete Dharma teachings with nothing missing {{note:{index:27,id:UT22084-088-038-86}}} —the Dharma that consists of the threefold path and that brings about rebirth as a god or a human and final emancipation. Wonderful indeed is Lord Śākyamuni’s courage, that in this world of helpless beings he establishes them on the path that leads to escape from the three realms, and he also establishes them in the state of nirvāṇa, which is complete with boundless spiritual accomplishment and happiness. {{note:{index:28,id:UT22084-088-038-87}}} Is it not true that only the awakened ones can know the minds of the lord buddhas? How could I know how to perform the magical feats {{note:{index:29,id:UT22084-088-038-88}}} of the lord buddhas, whose miracles stem from an inconceivable, wondrous, superhuman power? How could I know of their engagement in the mental and physical conduct that constitutes their potential for the accomplishment of tasks? {{note:{index:30,id:UT22084-088-038-89}}} Would I be able to even summarize these things in hundreds of thousands of millions of eons? The accomplishments of the tathāgatas, and all their forms without exception, whether separate and distinct or altogether, should be seen in terms of unconditioned dharmas. Only you, O Lord, the tathāgata, can explain the conduct and the qualities related to the elimination of traits eliminable through the path of seeing. {{note:{index:31,id:UT22084-088-038-90}}} I cannot do that.’ ” {1.31}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-91}} Seated on a great jeweled lotus miraculously created through his own magical power, Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, {{page:{number:9,folio:F.109.a}}} watched Lord Śākyamuni with anticipation. The latter, following the usual practice of a tathāgata, first gave by way of introduction the customary manifold preamble preceded by questions from the audience, and then he spoke to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, the bodhisattva, the great being, with a voice as sweet as Brahmā’s, a voice that resembled the call of a cuckoo or the resounding of thunder or a drum, a voice that is fitting to a Dharma discourse and causes the bodhisattva to be accomplished: {1.32}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-92}} “Welcome to you, Mañjuśrī! The extensive tract of this great manual will now be explained; it has been approved by me and taught by all the buddhas. It is the manual that effects the accomplishment of the conduct of great beings; that is blessed by the buddhas; that achieves the aims of bodhisattvas; that contains the mantra topics together with the secret empowerments, mudrās, maṇḍalas, and empowerment rituals; that brings about long life, lack of illness, and dominion and fulfills all wishes; that contains all the tantras on sādhana rites; that causes one to know all minds and mental objects, the occurrences in all times, all hidden phenomena, and the kingdoms and realms in the past, present, and future—in short, the fulfillment of all the wishes of all beings. This is a mantra practice that facilitates the generation of good qualities and is the cause of the joy of beings. This manual contains instructions on becoming invisible; traveling through space; fast walking; increasing intelligence; the magic of summoning; the ability to visit subterranean paradises; the rites of assault; the obtainment of every sensual pleasure; the power to summon the multitudes of yakṣa s and yakṣiṇīs, kiṃkaras, piśācas, and bhūtas; and the power to become a child, an old person, or a youth, as required by circumstances. {1.33}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-93}} “In short, this teaching has the power to perform all actions; it fulfills the heart’s every wish, magically manifesting itself in the magic of assault, of enriching, and of pacifying. It will be accomplished exactly according to how it is applied. Please teach now this ornament of the bodhisattva basket, this great, jewel-like, extensive manual, {{page:{number:10,folio:F.109.b}}} this treasury of teachings on the mantra practice of pure beings that was sanctioned by me and taught by all the buddhas. Teach it for the benefit and happiness of many beings, gods and humans, with all sentient beings in mind.” {1.34}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-94}} Upon hearing this, Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, entered the bodhisattva samādhi called arousing with an array of light rays the blessing power of all the buddhas. {{note:{index:32,id:UT22084-088-038-95}}} As soon as he, the pure being, entered this samādhi, the light primarily illuminated the world spheres that were as numerous as the grains of sand in many Gaṅgā rivers, as well as all the buddhafields from the Akaniṣṭha heaven to the Avīci hell. Any beings that were experiencing pain attained a peaceful state with their suffering pacified. Having aroused all the śrāvakas, pratyeka­buddhas, bodhisattvas, and lord buddhas, the light again disappeared into the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī’s forehead. Immediately, all the lord buddhas who inhabited the buddhafields in the eastern direction were impelled by the display of the light sphere illuminating everything around. These buddhas were: {1.35}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-96}} The tathāgata Jyotis­saumya­gandhāvabhāsa­śrī, the tathāgata Bhaiṣajya­guru­vaiḍūrya­prabha­rāja, the tathāgata Samantāvabhāsa­śrī, the tathāgata Samudgata­rāja, the tathāgata Śālendra­rāja, the tathāgata Lokendra­rāja, the tathāgata Amitāyurjñāna­viniścaya­rāja, the tathāgata Anantāvabhāsa­rājendra, and the tathāgata Jyoti­raśmirājendra. {1.36}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-97}} The lord buddhas headed by those just mentioned, {{page:{number:11,folio:F.110.a}}} surrounded by multitudes of bodhisattvas and residing in numberless and infinite world spheres—the tathāgatas, the arhats, the fully awakened ones—all congregated in the Sahā world in the realm of the Pure Abode where Śākyamuni, the tathāgata, the arhat, the fully awakened one, was staying together with Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, and expounding the vast topic of mantras and bodhisattva conduct. {1.37}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-98}} So it was also in the southern, western, and northern directions, and in the intermediate directions. The light illuminated there all the buddhafields that lie above, below, and across, and it obscured all the abodes of the māras. All the tathāgatas who were surrounded by multitudes of bodhisattvas and accompanied by congregations of śrāvakas, desiring to see the Pure Abode, the miraculous power of the buddhas, and the greatness of bodhisattvas, and desiring to make the instructions of the tathāgatas—the vast topics of the different types of samādhi produced by the mantra practice—shine unimpeded throughout the world, took their places.

The Lord of Wrath must not be pronounced in the presence of those whose desires have not been extinguished, for they also would wither and die. It should be recited by those who keep their samaya pledges, in front of a buddha image, or a caitya containing relics, or a book containing a genuine Dharma teaching, or in front of Mañjuśrī, the divine youth.

Letting out a terrible roar into the four directions, above, below, and across, he took up his position in the form of Yamāntaka Lord of Wrath , with a retinue of many hundreds of thousands of wrathful deities. Thus all beings, having become peaceful and content, did not transgress his orders. They also heard these words: “Those who would disobey this injunction, their heads will split into one hundred parts {{page:{number:39,folio:F.124.a}}} like a garland made of basil plants. For such is the power of the bodhisattvic blessing. {1.110}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-401}} Mañjuśrī then gave a Dharma teaching on the practice of his mantra.

O divine youth Mañjuśrī, this talk that is in accord with mantra practice and complies with the requirements of a fine Dharma discourse has been eloquently presented. If any king has this chapter, which records the coming together of the audience, retold, or causes it to be memorized or reflected upon, or if, before a battle, he has it mounted on an elephant and worshiped with various flowers, incense, scents, and ointments, there we will also be present. We will bring his opponents and enemies under control, and we will destroy the armies that oppose him. Or, if anyone keeps it in their house written in the form of a book, we will grant to that son or daughter of the Buddha family—be they a king or a queen, a monk or a nun, or a male or female lay practitioner—protection, prosperity, long life, life free from disease, and the continuous increase of good fortune.” {1.121}

As soon as Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, entered this samādhi, a ray of light issued from his navel. Along with many hundreds of thousands of millions of other rays, it entirely illuminated all the realms of sentient beings and, reflecting back onto the realm of the Pure Abode, suffused it with light. {2.1}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-430}} Then the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi, the great being, addressed Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:

{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-433}} Being thus requested by the lord of guhyakas and yakṣa s, Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, taught the most secret system of the maṇḍala.

Raising his right hand, he drew the attention of the assembled congregation by using the tip of his finger, from which emerged many hundreds of thousands of millions of vidyādhara kings. {{note:{index:274,id:UT22084-088-038-434}}} Upon emerging, they illuminated the entire realm of the Pure Abode with great light and remained there. {2.3}

This mantra effects summoning, dismissing, pacifying, enriching, {{note:{index:275,id:UT22084-088-038-436}}} and assaulting. It bestows the ability to become invisible, travel through space, enter subterranean paradises, and walk with great speed. {{note:{index:276,id:UT22084-088-038-437}}} It can be used for the activities of bringing beings into one’s presence, sowing enmity among them or enthralling them, and obtaining all kinds of {{page:{number:44,folio:F.126.b}}} perfume, garlands, ointments, and lamps. Being the chief mantra in its own tradition, it can accomplish, in short, anything that it is employed for. It is called Three Syllables. It is a great hero that accomplishes all purposes; it is the Great Lord of Wrath himself. {{note:{index:277,id:UT22084-088-038-438}}} And what is it? {2.4}

May the bodhisattvas with great magical powers, present throughout the limitless universe, empower this pledge!” {2.6}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-442}} Having said this, he turned the Lord of Wrath around and dispatched him. As soon as he was dispatched, the Great Lord of Wrath went to every world sphere and, in an instant, subjugated all ill-willed beings possessed of great magical powers and brought them into the great assembly in the realm of the Pure Abode. Having thus established them there, he assumed a form surrounded by a blaze of light and placed himself atop the heads of the evil beings. {2.7}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-443}} Then Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, looking at the gathering, said, “Please listen, all you respectable beings!

{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-1212}} Now Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, rose from his seat, circumambulated Lord Śākyamuni three times clockwise and, having prostrated at his feet, said this to the Blessed One:
“Good! It is good that you, the blessed one, the tathāgata, the worthy one, the perfectly awakened one, gave this Dharma discourse in such a clear way for the benefit, the welfare, and the happiness of all who observe their vidyā vows and in order to show your compassion for the world.

“Good, Mañjuśrī! It is good that you ask the Tathāgata about this matter. There is, Mañjuśrī, your most secret and detailed teaching on another procedure of cloth painting, with its associated conduct and practice of the vidyā observances.

At that moment rays of blue, yellow, and translucent crystalline light {{note:{index:663,id:UT22084-088-038-1299}}} issued from the mouth of Lord Śākyamuni. As soon as these rays issued forth, they illuminated the entire assembly and dimmed the worldly realm of the great trichiliocosm, including the abodes of all the māras. This included the light of the entire multitude of stars, celestial bodies, mountain ranges, and the moon and the sun, those two luminaries of great power and might, which were also dimmed by the light of Śākyamuni’s rays. They lost their radiance and did not illuminate the worlds. They did not shine and appeared dark.

Through that they will attain a continuous mental state of inner rejoicing that makes their bodily hair bristle with joy.

“There is, O Mañjuśrī, a secret vidyā mantra of yours that accomplishes all mantras. It was granted by the tathāgatas, arose from the treasury of their teachings, belongs to the ‘Cloud of Dharma,’ and is of the essence of the sky. This vidyā is the supreme lord of all mundane and supramundane mantras, just like the divine youth is the lord of all beings. This lord is described as a tathāgata, the supreme and the most excellent. Just as Lord Buddha, O divine youth, is the most eminent person among gods and men , so he—this supreme vidyārāja —is among all the mantras. He has been formerly taught by the blessed buddhas who are equal in number to the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā and whose merits are ineffable. He has been regarded by them as the supremely secret heart mantra {{page:{number:170,folio:F.189.b}}} of the tathāgata Ratnaketu , auspicious in every respect. He is praised and extolled by all the buddhas, is the relief of all beings, and is the destroyer of every evil. He grants every wish and fulfills every hope. So what is this mantra?” {{note:{index:1013,id:UT22084-088-038-2160}}} {14.1}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-2161}} While he spoke, a ray of light called arouser of all the buddhas emerged from the tuft of hair between the eyebrows of the blessed Śākyamuni. It illuminated all the buddhafields in the ten directions, above, below, and everywhere, delighting the minds of all beings. It then disappeared into Blessed Śākyamuni’s uṣṇīṣa . Subsequently, there emerged from the same uṣṇīṣa the lord of vidyā s named One Syllable, as a form ablaze all around with the light that all ordinary beings find impossible to look at, or to lay hold of. Out of this great effulgence emerged his body, consisting of a halo of light, displaying multiple aspects and the great form of a cakravartin. {14.2}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-2162}} Having emerged, he illuminated the entire sky. He had a retinue of all the vidyā king s and was attended on and worshiped by many hundreds of thousands of millions of vidyā s. He was praised by all the supramundane cakravartins and vidyārāja s, eulogized by all the mantras, {{note:{index:1014,id:UT22084-088-038-2163}}} and cherished by all the buddhas and the bodhisattva great beings who had attained the tenth level of realization.

He positioned himself in midair above Lord Śākyamuni, facing and looking upon the entire realm of the Pure Abode and illuminating the circle of the great assembly. {14.3}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-2165}} Lord Śākyamuni then pronounced the One Syllable, this vidyā cakravartin, the heart essence of all the tathāgatas, the supreme secret heart essence of the tathāgata called Ratnaketu ; the One Syllable that is taught and cherished by all the tathāgatas intimately connected with Lord Ratnaketu {{note:{index:1016,id:UT22084-088-038-2166}}} —Śālendra­rāja, {{page:{number:171,folio:F.190.a}}} Amitābha, Duḥprasaha, Sunetra, Suketu, Puṣpendra, and the sage Supināntaloka—and also by the [three] tathāgatas starting with Kanaka; the One Syllable that is taught and celebrated by all the perfectly awakened ones who have gone beyond.

{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-2172}} As soon as the One Syllable was pronounced by Lord Śākyamuni, all the world spheres of the great trichiliocosm shook in six different ways. All the buddhafields became filled with light and all the blessed buddhas dwelling there joined the circle of the great assembly gathered in the realm of the Pure Abode. So, too, all the bodhisattvas on the tenth level of realization who were irreversibly established in perfect awakening, all the śrāvakas and pratyeka­buddhas, all the beings possessed of great powers, roused by the light from One Syllable, the vidyārāja , arrived enthralled {{note:{index:1021,id:UT22084-088-038-2173}}} in the assembly. {{page:{number:172,folio:F.190.b}}} And other beings living in infinite worldly realms who followed the painful destinies of hell, the hungry ghosts, and animals, were touched by the radiance of the great light. When thus illuminated, those who were acutely suffering, immersed in their painful experience, became cheered in their minds. They entered definitively into the three vehicles. {14.6}
{{milestone:UT22084-088-038-2174}} Then Lord Śākyamuni looked again at this great circle of the assembly and said this to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:
