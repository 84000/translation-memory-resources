{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-845}} Thus did I hear at one time: The Blessed One was residing on Vulture Peak in Rājagṛha together with a great saṅgha of sixty-two thousand monks, and with seventy-two thousand bodhisattva great beings who had gathered from the worlds of the ten directions. All of them had developed the higher perceptions. They had attained recollection, unobstructed eloquence, and absorption. They were perfectly mindful, intelligent, realized, devoted, humble, and modest. Their motivation was firm and indivisible like vajra. They perfectly applied themselves to all the qualities of buddhahood, and they had developed the most noble motivation. Without ever themselves forsaking the mind set on awakening, they caused others to adopt that same attitude. They were generous, self-controlled, restrained, gentle, and patient. Everything that was pleasant they would give away, and knew how to dedicate these acts. Their bodies, speech, and minds were adorned with the ornament of discipline. They had an impartial attitude toward all beings and they had donned the powerful armors of patience and gentleness. They had exercised diligence for countless billions of eons, and they reveled in the wisdom of the concentrations, liberations, absorptions, attainments, and higher knowledges. They were experts in the wisdom and insight of unobstructed eloquence with respect to the distinctions of all words. Their minds were unshakeable like Mount Sumeru. {{page:{number:2,folio:F.254.b}}} Like earth, water, fire, wind, and mountains they were free of attachment and anger. They were abiding in great love and their splendor was unobstructed. They were abiding in great compassion and always diligent in caring for all beings. They were abiding in great joy and were delighted by the joy of Dharma. They were abiding {{note:{index:21,id:UT22084-058-006-846}}} in great equanimity and had reached nondual cognition.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-847}} They had completely transcended the eight worldly concerns—gain, loss, fame, disgrace, praise, blame, pleasure, and suffering. They had utterly defeated all the multitudes of wicked opponents and conquered the hostile forces of Māra and the afflictions. Their presence was as rare as the sight of the uḍumbara flower and, without being asked, they acted as virtuous friends for all sentient beings, always accompanying them until nirvāṇa. {{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-058-006-848}}} They uttered the great lion’s roar, resounding with the profound Dharma of the Buddha as well as with fearlessness. They were marked by the seal of the thus-gone ones. They taught clearly {{note:{index:23,id:UT22084-058-006-849}}} without any disturbance and their actions accorded with their words. They were diligent in the Dharma-way of suchness, and their light eclipsed the light of the sun and the moon. Their voices resounded throughout the ten directions, they contemplated all buddha qualities, {{note:{index:24,id:UT22084-058-006-850}}} and they upheld the treasury of the Dharma jewel. Their minds were focused on keeping the lineage of the Three Jewels unbroken. They were skilled in traveling to an infinity of buddha realms. They had the intelligence that is grounded in the discernment of all distinctions. To see and hear them was so beneficial that it was overwhelming. They constantly exerted themselves to bring sentient beings to maturity and they had reached the highest level of mastering insight and methods. They taught the Dharma to all sentient beings in the appropriate manner, knowing those who were of the highest faculties and those who were not. {{page:{number:3,folio:F.255.a}}} They were skilled in observing the conduct of all sentient beings and they were naturally skilled in the pursuits and imputations of all beings. Due to their great fearlessness, they were dauntless, and they were utterly at peace from old age, sickness, death, and the afflictions. They had created roots of virtue in relation to a boundless number of billions of buddhas. They had gathered the accumulation of merit that completes the excellent major and minor marks, and they had also gathered the accumulation of wisdom.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-851}} They were inclined toward all the qualities of emptiness, the absence of marks, and the absence of wishes. They were free from aspiration. {{note:{index:25,id:UT22084-058-006-852}}} They were confident in the insight that all beings and phenomena are like illusions, mirages, dreams, reflections of the moon in water, optical illusions, echoes, and space. They were experts in the wisdom that teaches in the words of all languages, and they had achieved the four correct knowledges related to phenomena, meaning, language, and eloquence. They had actualized the power of supramundane insight, obtained the ten powers that possess great might, and developed the perceptions of the physical eye, the divine eye, the insight eye, the Dharma eye, and the buddha eye. They were experts in the wisdom that engages in all the ways of gathering the accumulations related to the branches of the path. They knew the procedures for developing the understanding of the bodhisattvas’ scriptural collection. They turned the irreversible Dharma wheel. They had reached the absorption of the seal of characteristics . They were experts in the wisdom related to the absorption of the vajra circle . They had manifested the absorption that controls all phenomena . They held the torch of the supreme Dharma Jewel. They perceived the mindstreams of all beings and were experts in seeing their thoughts. {{note:{index:26,id:UT22084-058-006-853}}} They were attending to all beings through the activity of awakened wisdom {{page:{number:4,folio:F.255.b}}} and they were adorned with all the precious qualities replete with the most supreme of all aspects. Even if their praises were proclaimed for all the eons, this task would never come to an end.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1482}} The Blessed One replied, “Noble son, ask whatever you wish of the Thus-Gone One, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha. I will answer your questions and bring satisfaction to your mind.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-887}} The bodhisattva great being Divyamauli said, “Excellent!” and, heeding the Blessed One’s instructions, put his questions to the Blessed One.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-925}} When the Blessed One had explained this Dharma teaching on fourfold accomplishments, {{page:{number:20,folio:F.263.b}}} this great trichiliocosm shook in six ways, a bright light pervaded the universe, and billions of gods living in the sky started to sing divine songs. They caused a rain of divine mandārava flowers to fall and exclaimed, “Oh! The unsurpassed and perfect awakening of the blessed buddhas that has been described in this Dharma teaching on fourfold accomplishments was achieved countless billions of eons ago by the Blessed One! {{note:{index:42,id:UT22084-058-006-926}}} Blessed One, those sentient beings who hear this Dharma teaching on fourfold accomplishments, develop interest upon hearing it, and then retain it, carry it, read it, comprehend it, and teach it to others without parting from the mind of awakening will not be endowed with trifling roots of virtue. Just as the Thus-Gone One, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha proclaimed the lion’s roar today, they will proclaim the lion’s roar within the worlds of gods, humans, and demigods. Blessed One, we are very fortunate to have heard this Dharma teaching on fourfold accomplishments!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-927}} When the Blessed One had explained this Dharma teaching on fourfold accomplishments, eighty-four thousand gods and humans gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening, and twelve thousand bodhisattvas reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1484}} Then, the bodhisattva great being Divyamauli asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, what are the qualities that will be possessed by the bodhisattvas who retain a sūtra like this one after the Thus-Gone One’s passing, {{page:{number:21,folio:F.264.a}}} and who teach it at length to others?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-929}} “Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “the bodhisattvas who retain such a sūtra after the Thus-Gone One’s passing, and who teach it in a vast way to others, will possess eight qualities. What are those eight? (1) Their intent with respect to perfect awakening will be definitive—they will possess a perfect attitude. (2) They will be devoid of anger toward any being—they will cultivate the practice of great love. (3) They will abide by the activity of ripening beings—they will abide by great compassion. (4) They will wish for the Dharma and exert themselves in its pursuit. (5) They will be insatiable in their pursuit of learning and their level of erudition will become as vast as an ocean.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-930}} Then, through the power of the Buddha, this great trichiliocosm shook in six ways, all the higher and lower regions, the black mountains, and all springs, lakes, ponds, and oceans disappeared, and this entire earth became flat like the palm of the hand. {{page:{number:22,folio:F.264.b}}} Still, all the beings living in the water remained unharmed. Also, throughout this great trichiliocosm all the trees that had withered centuries before started to bloom and bear various fruits. These trees then bent in the direction of the Blessed One and paid homage to him. All of the other trees also started to bloom and bear various fruits, before bending in the direction of the Blessed One and paying homage to him. Bright, lovely, colorful, fragrant, and delightful lotuses the size of chariot wheels sprang up from the earth, and a dazzling light illuminated this great trichiliocosm. Without anyone being seen or anything being played, divine music and singing were heard from the sky. Colorful divine flowers that emanated the most delicious fragrances, which had never been experienced before, now appeared on the majestic Himavat mountains as well as on the majestic Mount Gandhamādana, and their sweet fragrances spread throughout this great trichiliocosm. A great rain of flowers then fell from the majestic Himavat mountains and from the majestic Mount Gandhamādana onto the retinue of the Blessed One, covering the earth up to their knees. Rains of various types of flowers fell from the blooming trees and the sounds of music and song resounded all around. A parasol made of all kinds of precious gems and measuring about a million leagues covered the sky. Pearl garlands and lattices formed by different types of small precious bells were hanging from that bejeweled parasol. The small bells rang out with the most delightful, {{page:{number:23,folio:F.265.a}}} enthralling, and enrapturing sounds that pervade this great trichiliocosm.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-931}} At that moment, Venerable Śāriputra asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, whose coming is augured by these delightful and pleasurable signs that manifest on such a vast scale and adorn this great trichiliocosm so richly?”
“Śāriputra,” replied the Blessed One, “these are the signs of the arrival of Druma, the king of the kiṃnaras. He is coming from Mount Gandhamādana with a retinue of many thousands of kiṃnaras, a retinue of many thousands of gandharvas, and a retinue of many thousands of gods.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-933}} As soon as the Blessed One had said those words, the kiṃnara king Druma arrived at the place where the Blessed One was residing. He was accompanied by eighty-four thousand musicians and singers and surrounded by a retinue of several hundred thousand. From the sky above a stream of flowers rained down. When he arrived, he prostrated with his retinue at the feet of the Blessed One, circumambulated him three times, and sat in front of him. In the presence of the Blessed One and accompanied by the eighty-four thousand musicians, the kiṃnara king Druma then began to play his lute. Its body was made of beryl and it had trim and veneer made of gold from the Jambū River. {{note:{index:43,id:UT22084-058-006-934}}} It was adorned with gold, jewels, and many precious substances, and purified through the ripening of his previous actions. As soon as the kiṃnara king Druma started to play, the tunes of his lute resounded throughout this great trichiliocosm. The tunes from his lute outclassed all the divine music from the strings and songs of the gods of the desire realm, to the point that these could no longer be heard. {{page:{number:24,folio:F.265.b}}} Then, impelled by the tunes of that lute, the gods of the desire realm put down their divine instruments and came to the place where the Blessed One was residing. As soon as the kiṃnara king Druma started to play his lute, all the trees, and the majestic mountains Sumeru, Himavat, Gandhamādana, Mucilinda, and Mahāmucilinda, the black mountains, and all blades of grass, branches, medicinal plants, and forests of this great trichiliososm started to vibrate, shudder, and reel; wobble, rock, and sway; and quiver, tremble, and quake. Just as someone intoxicated by liquor staggers, reels, and wobbles, all those trees and mountains started to bend, bow, and twist.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-935}} With the exception of the bodhisattvas who had reached the level of irreversibility, as soon as the kiṃnara king Druma started to play his beryl lute, all those who had gathered in the assembly surrounding the Blessed One—the dispassionate monks, nuns, male lay practitioners, and female lay practitioners, as well as the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas, Śakra, Brahmā, the protectors of the world, humans, nonhumans, worthy ones absorbed in the eight liberations, and the entire retinue—became overwhelmed upon hearing the tunes emitted by that lute. They stood up and started to shake, shiver, and tremble; they bent, bowed, and twisted; and they danced, swayed, and whirled. Even all the great hearers could not remain in their seats. They trembled, shook, acted wildly, {{page:{number:25,folio:F.266.a}}} and danced around like small children.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-936}} The bodhisattva Divyamauli said to all those great hearers, “Venerable ones, great hearers, you are free from afflictions, you are absorbed in the eight liberations, and you have seen the four truths. Why can you no longer control your bodies? Venerable ones, you are dancing around like small children!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1485}} “Noble son,” replied the great hearers, “as the kiṃnara king Druma picked up his lute and started playing it, the music and songs made it impossible for us to remain in our seats; we began to shake, shiver, and tremble, and we were unable to control our minds.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-938}} The bodhisattva Divyamauli then said to the elder Mahākāśyapa, “Venerable Mahākāśyapa, you have reached old age and are frail, you are content and have few desires, you uphold the ascetic practices, and you are the focus of worship for the world with its gods, humans, and demigods. Why can you no longer control your body? You are an elder, but you dance around like a small child!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-939}} “Noble son,” said the elder Mahākāśyapa, “when a violent wind is blowing during a hurricane, all the plants, forests, and mountains become powerless and weak; they cannot remain in place and quiver, tremble, shake, and wobble against their will. Noble son, in the same way, upon hearing the tunes emitted by the lute of the kiṃnara king Druma, we became unable to control ourselves, just like great mountains shaken by a violent hurricane. Why is that so? Because such are the extraordinary qualities of the aspiration, merit, and wisdom of this sublime being. {{page:{number:26,folio:F.266.b}}} They outclass the merit, wisdom, and magnificence of the hearers.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-940}} The bodhisattva Divyamauli continued, “Venerable Mahākāśyapa, the tunes emitted by this lute are unable to affect and shake the splendor, the magnificence, and the power of the bodhisattvas who have reached the level of irreversibility. Therefore, Venerable Mahākāśyapa, why would one not give rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening? Notice how the power and magnificence of those who possess limited wisdom is outclassed by the tunes of that lute, and how the power and magnificence of the followers of the Great Vehicle cannot be outclassed.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-941}} At that moment, when the kiṃnara king Druma played his lute, through the power of the Buddha and the blessings of his previous aspirations, these verses manifested from his lute and the other eighty-four thousand instruments:

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-966}} As these verses were manifested, their elucidations caused one hundred thousand bodhisattvas to reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.

“Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “Ask the kiṃnara king Druma. He will answer your question.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-969}} The bodhisattva Divyamauli then asked the kiṃnara king Druma, “Lord of the kiṃnaras, where did these manifested verses appear from?”
The kiṃnara king Druma replied, “They come from where the words pronounced by all beings come from.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1488}} “Lord of the kiṃnaras, where do the words pronounced by all beings come from?”
“Noble son, the words pronounced by all beings come from space.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-973}} “Lord of the kiṃnaras, is it not the case that the words pronounced by all beings come from within themselves?” {{page:{number:29,folio:F.268.a}}}
“Noble son, what do you think? Do the words pronounced by all beings come from within their bodies, or do they come from their minds?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-975}} “Lord of the kiṃnaras, they come neither from their bodies nor from their minds, since their bodies are made of inanimate matter that cannot perform actions—like grass, clay, walls, trees, or optical illusions—and since their minds are formless, indemonstrable, unimpeded, and imperceptible like illusions.”
“Noble son, apart from their bodies and minds, where else could these words come from?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1489}} “Lord of the kiṃnaras, it is said that the words of beings come from mental engagement.”
“If there were no space, where would sounds come from?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-978}} “Lord of the kiṃnaras, apart from space, where else could sounds come from?”
“Noble son, you should understand through what we have said here that all sounds come from space. The essential nature of space is sound; it ceases as soon as it is perceived, and once it ceases, it remains within the essential nature of space. It is therefore said that all phenomena are the same as space. Even though they are surely beyond perception and impossible to know, they are expressed through words and verbal expressions, and those expressions are designations. Those who understand verbal expressions in this way are not attached to anything; those who are not attached do not generate conceptual elaboration; those who do not generate conceptual elaboration do not transmigrate; those who do not circle around are unbreakable; those who are unbreakable do not take birth; those who are not born do not perish; those who do not perish are pure; those who are pure are immaculate; those who are immaculate are stainless; those who are stainless are clear; and clarity is the nature of the mind. The nature of the mind is penetration; penetration overcomes all marks; and those who overcome all marks are said to enter into faultlessness. {{page:{number:30,folio:F.268.b}}} The bodhisattvas who enter into faultlessness reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. They are therefore referred to as ‘bodhisattvas who have entered into faultlessness and reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.’
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-981}} “Those who have reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena have reached acceptance with respect to everything, with respect to both emptiness and persons. Why is that so? Because emptiness is not different from persons; persons themselves are emptiness. They have reached acceptance with respect to both marks and the absence of marks. Why is that so? Because the essential nature of marks is the absence of marks. They have reached acceptance with respect to both wishes and the absence of wishes. Why is that so? Because the characteristic of the essential nature of wishes is the absence of wishes. They have reached acceptance with respect to beings’ inherent transcendence of suffering as well their process of death and rebirth. Why is that so? Because death and rebirth have the essential nature of being illusions. Noble son, the bodhisattvas who have reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena in this way are without cessation and are not in conflict with any phenomenon. Their acceptance with respect to the self encompasses all sentient beings, and it also encompasses all phenomena, since it is beyond coming and going. They correctly know that all phenomena abide within the realm of phenomena and that the same goes for all beings. That attainment whereby nothing is attained is referred to in conventional terms as ‘gaining acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.’ This acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena cannot be expressed, described, or demonstrated. Why is that so? Because its meaning is inexpressible, beyond words, and indescribable. Noble son, this teaching in which the inexpressible meaning is nevertheless expressed demonstrates the greatness of the Thus-Gone One!” {{page:{number:31,folio:F.269.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-982}} The bodhisattva Divyamauli then said to the Blessed One, “Oh, Blessed One, the kiṃnara king Druma’s eloquence in teaching the acceptance of the profound Dharma is amazing! So is his level of experience and perception of this vast domain, and his profound acceptance while teaching the Dharma! Blessed One, in relation to how many thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect buddhas did the kiṃnara king Druma create roots of virtue to develop such eloquence?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-983}} “Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “are you able to count all the stars present in as many universes as there are grains of sand in the Ganges? Similarly, all the perfect buddhas in relation to whom the kiṃnara king Druma created roots of virtue, and all the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas in whose presence he practiced pure conduct in his pursuit of unsurpassed and perfect awakening are uncountable. This is the reason why he has developed such eloquence.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-984}} The bodhisattva Divyamauli then said to the kiṃnara king Druma, “Lord of the kiṃnaras, will you awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood due to the numerous roots of virtue you have accumulated in relation to all those many thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect buddhas?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1490}} “Noble son,” replied the kiṃnara king Druma, “when bodhisattvas are creating roots of virtue, there are twelve activities they never tire of. What are those twelve? They never tire of (1) worshiping and venerating the thus-gone ones, {{page:{number:32,folio:F.269.b}}} (2) listening to the Dharma, (3) upholding the sacred Dharma, (4) teaching the Dharma at length, (5) bringing sentient beings to maturity, (6) producing roots of virtue, (7) living in the wilderness, (8) mastering all the perfections, (9) purifying and ripening wisdom, (10) contemplating the Dharma and correctly putting it into practice, (11) pursuing the accumulations of merit and wisdom, and (12) accomplishing all the factors of awakening. Noble son, when bodhisattvas are creating roots of virtue, those are the twelve activities they never tire of. It is therefore said that bodhisattvas never grow tired of gathering the accumulation of virtue.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-986}} The kiṃnara king Druma then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, there is a bodhisattva absorption known as the source of wealth . I have heard that if bodhisattvas rely on this absorption they will attain all extraordinary, precious qualities. Blessed One, so that those bodhisattvas may hear about that absorption and attain all those extraordinary, precious qualities, could the Thus-Gone One please explain to us this bodhisattva absorption of the source of wealth ?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1491}} “Lord of the kiṃnaras,” replied the Blessed One, “listen carefully and keep this in mind. I will explain to you the bodhisattva absorption of the source of wealth .”
The kiṃnara king Druma agreed to this and listened as the Blessed One had directed. {{page:{number:33,folio:F.270.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-987}} The Blessed One then said, “Lord of the kiṃnaras, bodhisattvas engage in eighty precious attitudes to avoid interrupting the continuity of the Buddha Jewel, to avoid interrupting the continuity of the Dharma Jewel, and to avoid interrupting the continuity of the Saṅgha Jewel.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-994}} “Lord of the kiṃnaras, engaging in those eighty attitudes, developing them, and persevering in them is known as the absorption of the source of wealth . Those attitudes constitute the practice of that absorption. Once bodhisattvas achieve this absorption of the source of wealth , there is no mundane or supramundane wealth that they do not gain control over. Lord of the kiṃnaras, what is meant by mundane and supramundane wealth?
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-995}} “Lord of the kiṃnaras, mundane wealth refers to the greatness of gods and humans, such as that of Śakra, Brahmā, the protectors of the world, universal monarchs, merchants, householders, and brahmins and kṣatriyas that are like great sāl trees. Although the bodhisattvas achieve the greatness of gods and humans, they do not become excited or careless. Instead, they remain careful and so they accomplish the qualities that lead to awakening. This is what is meant by mundane wealth.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-996}} “What is meant by supramundane wealth? It is the precious Dharma that transcends the world. {{page:{number:38,folio:F.272.b}}} What is the precious Dharma that transcends the world? It is the Dharma that liberates from the world. What is the Dharma that liberates from the world? It is the noble supramundane insight—the insight that liberates from the world. This precious insight subsumes all qualities that transcend the world; it is the most important among all supramundane qualities. For example, lord of the kiṃnaras, the most important body of water is the great ocean, the most important mountain is the majestic Mount Sumeru, the most important celestial body is the moon, the most important source of light is the sun, the most important wild animal is the lion, the most important person is the king, the most important god in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three is Śakra, and the most important being within the Brahmā realms is the Great Brahmā. Similarly, lord of the kiṃnaras, the most important of all supramundane qualities is insight, and it is therefore referred to as the king of all qualities.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-997}} “Insight is the path that frees from non-Buddhist views and thus leads to happy states of existence. It is the lamp that clears away the darkness of afflictions, the hero that brings victory in battle, the doctor that dispenses medicine, the teacher that imparts the knowledge of all sciences, the arrow that pierces all phenomena, the sword that severs all afflictions, and the plough that cuts through the thicket of the afflictions. Since it is sameness, it is beyond contradiction. Since it pacifies conflict, it is beyond dispute. Since it is beyond arising, it is beyond cessation. Since it is the ultimate understanding of the true meaning, it is undisturbed. Since it employs mindfulness, it remembers. It sees the sameness of the true relinquishments. It gives rise to the bases of miraculous display. It guards the strengths. Due to its powers, it cannot be suppressed. It contemplates the branches of awakening. It shows the path. It brings the peace of tranquility. {{page:{number:39,folio:F.273.a}}} It knows special insight. It illumines because it is free from obscuration. With the light of Dharma it dispels darkness. Since it is free from stains, it is immaculate. Since it is free from disrespect, it is devoid of arrogance. Since it transcends the path of fear, it produces knowledge. Since it transcends inside and outside, it is devoid of object. Since it is devoid of the formulation of views, {{note:{index:52,id:UT22084-058-006-998}}} it is liberating emptiness. Since it pacifies conceptuality, it is characterized by the absence of marks. Since it transcends the three realms, it has the characteristic of the absence of wishes. Since it is devoid of characteristics, it is the single characteristic. Since it is unequaled, it has the characteristic of space. Since it is beyond the work of Māra, it has conquered the movement of thoughts and conceptuality. It is nonconceptual generosity, nonabiding discipline, nondwelling patience, diligence beyond acceptance and rejection, concentration free from imputation, and the gateway {{note:{index:53,id:UT22084-058-006-999}}} to the imperceptible. It is directed toward everything. It is skillful. It is fully committed to the selflessness of all beings. It accumulates roots of virtue. It is beyond deeds and free from activity.

This is the precious insight achieved by the bodhisattvas who have reached the absorption of the source of wealth . When this insight is achieved, all wealth is subsumed within it. For example, lord of the kiṃnaras, the great ocean is the gateway for all rivers and it contains and gathers all jewels; it is the source of all of them. Similarly, lord of the kiṃnaras, the bodhisattvas who attain this absorption of the source of wealth become the gateways for all wealth; they contain the entire Dharma Jewel and subsume all other wealth. {{page:{number:40,folio:F.273.b}}} The Three Jewels—the Buddha Jewel, the Dharma Jewel, and the Saṅgha Jewel—originate from that absorption of the source of wealth .

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1001}} The bodhisattva Divyamauli then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, has the kiṃnara king Druma achieved this absorption of the source of jewels ?”
“Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “you should ask the kiṃnara king Druma and he will tell you.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1003}} The bodhisattva Divyamauli then asked the kiṃnara king Druma, “Lord of the kiṃnaras, have you achieved this absorption of the source of jewels ?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1492}} The kiṃnara king Druma replied, “Noble son, this absorption does not concern something that can be attained or apprehended. It cannot be attained by anyone. This absorption cannot be categorized as form, feeling, perception, formation, or consciousness. This absorption does not have a physical form. This absorption cannot be apprehended by the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, or the mind. It does not have the characteristics of arising, ceasing, and enduring. It does not have the characteristic of being interrupted. It does not have a singular characteristic or several characteristics. It is not characterized or noncharacterized, but neither is it beyond characteristics. It is inexpressible. This absorption cannot be understood, realized, or comprehended. Why is that so? Because, if this absorption was understood, realized, or comprehended, {{page:{number:41,folio:F.274.a}}} it would become a basis of investigation and it would not be an absorption.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1005}} “Noble son, absorption refers to the sameness of all phenomena. The sameness of all phenomena is the same with respect to myself and all beings.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1006}} At that moment, the bodhisattva Divyamauli exclaimed, “Blessed One, the careful conduct of the kiṃnara king Druma and his eloquence concerning the Dharma are amazing!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1493}} “Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “this way of displaying all activities while not being tainted by any of them is the level of bodhisattvas who are adept in skill and insight. Noble son, through the tunes of his lute, and through the songs, instruments, and drums, the kiṃnara king Druma has ripened seventy million kiṃnaras toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening, along with three hundred million gandharvas {{page:{number:42,folio:F.274.b}}} and four hundred million mahoragas. He has also ripened eighty-four thousand beings from his own retinue toward awakening. Whenever bodhisattvas who possess such wisdom of insight and skill have a following of some magnitude, countless beings are ripened. Noble son, a fire cannot blaze without kindling. Likewise, when bodhisattva great beings remain in solitude, the ripening of beings cannot blaze. Noble son, a fire blazes when it is fueled by substances to burn. Likewise, when bodhisattva great beings reside among ordinary beings, the ripening of those beings will blaze. Noble son, through this analogy, you should understand that bodhisattvas ripen countless beings in proportion to the magnitude of the territory and the following they command.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1008}} When the Blessed One had said those words, the bodhisattva Divyamauli asked him, “Blessed One, how does the kiṃnara king Druma ripen beings through the tunes of those lutes, songs, instruments, and drums?”

Then, in accordance with the blessings, the kiṃnara king Druma caught the flowers in his right hand and tossed them toward the Blessed One without letting a single one of them fall to the ground. As soon as he threw those flowers, through the power of the Buddha a parasol made of precious flowers covered this entire chiliocosm. Billions of pearl garlands hung from it, and myriads of light rays radiated from each pearl in those pearl garlands. {{note:{index:54,id:UT22084-058-006-1013}}} Various lovely, colorful, fragrant, and delightful lotuses appeared on the tip of every light ray, and on top of each of those lotuses thus-gone ones displaying the same physical form as the Blessed One Śākyamuni appeared, sitting cross-legged.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1495}} All those blessed buddhas gave their approval to the kiṃnara king Druma. They said, “Sublime being, you have ripened many beings.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1014}} The kiṃnara king Druma then formed the resolve, “I will manifest other bejeweled parasols to cover the heads of all those thus-gone ones!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1496}} At that moment, the kiṃnara king Druma entered the absorption called the array of bejeweled parasols . As soon as he had entered this absorption, bejeweled parasols manifested right above the head of each thus-gone one. Bejeweled parasols also appeared in the right hands of each member of the assembly, and they used them to shelter those blessed buddhas.

I will supplicate the Blessed One and his retinue to come to my land at the majestic Mount Gandhamādana, to enjoy my abode and benefit countless gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1017}} The kiṃnara king Druma prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One, joined the palms of his hands, and said, {{page:{number:47,folio:F.277.a}}} “Blessed One, out of love for me and in order to increase the roots of virtue of countless beings, I supplicate the Thus-Gone One, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha to agree to remain for seven days in my abode on the slope of Mount Gandhamādana with his saṅgha of bodhisattvas and his saṅgha of hearers. Blessed One, we would be delighted to venerate and serve the Thus-Gone One and his retinue!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1018}} Out of love for the kiṃnara king Druma, the Blessed One agreed to remain for seven days on the slope of Mount Gandhamādana with his assemblies of bodhisattvas and hearers. When the kiṃnara king Druma saw that the Blessed One had accepted his request, he became satisfied, cheerful, thrilled, and elated. With joy and happiness filling his mind, he and his subjects and servants prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One, and circumambulated him three times.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1019}} Then, as an act of worship for the Blessed One, the kiṃnara king Druma decorated his home with all sorts of ornaments. He adorned the five hundred leagues of his vast courtyard with blue beryl stones and with lotuses made of gold from the Jambū River, and he beautified it with a variety of other precious substances. In that courtyard, he arranged on foundations made of precious substances many hundreds of thousands of seats on which a hundred thousand divine fabrics were spread. He also prepared a lion throne for the Blessed One, which was twelve leagues high. It was adorned with all types of precious substances and was surrounded by jeweled stands that supported parasols, banners, and flags. It was perfumed with the finest incense, covered by a canopy, decorated with many silken streamers, and strewn with divine flowers. {{page:{number:48,folio:F.277.b}}} In the four directions around this lion throne, he emanated four groups of splendid precious trees.

Through this instruction, the king became satisfied, cheerful, thrilled, and elated. With joy and happiness filling his mind, he clothed the Blessed One in a priceless piece of seamless fabric. He also clad each member of the saṅgha of bodhisattvas and each member of the saṅgha of hearers with cloths of inestimable value, and offered all his dwelling places for the enjoyment of the Blessed One. Then, eight thousand sons of the kiṃnara king Druma offered shade to the Blessed One with an array of precious lotuses and eight thousand precious parasols. {{page:{number:67,folio:F.287.a}}} In that very moment, through the power of the Buddha, all those parasols merged to form a single precious parasol in the sky, about a thousand leagues above the courtyard, right over the Blessed One’s head.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1502}} When the eight thousand sons of the kiṃnara king Druma saw this great miraculous display manifested by the Blessed One, they became satisfied, cheerful, thrilled, and elated. With joy and happiness filling their minds, they gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening with determination and supplicated the Blessed One: “Blessed One, Thus-Gone One, Worthy One, Perfect Buddha, please tell us about the qualities that mature into awakening so that, upon hearing about them, we may accomplish the factors of awakening!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1068}} Aware of the good motivation of the sons of the kiṃnara king Druma, the Blessed One rose up to a height of seven palm trees and remained seated cross-legged in the air. His body shone with light, illuminating this entire great trichiliocosm with a bright light. All the various musical instruments of the kiṃnaras, the gandharvas, the mahoragas, and the gods of the desire realm then started to resound with the most delightful music, without anyone playing them. The sound of music also rang out from all the fragrant, flowering, and blooming trees growing on the majestic Mount Gandhamādana. Next, myriads of light rays shone from all the pores of the Blessed One’s skin, and lotus flowers the size of chariot wheels manifested on the tip of each light ray. At the heart of each lotus flower bodhisattvas appeared, displaying pure bodies adorned with the thirty-two marks of great beings. Then, through the power of the Buddha, all the musical instruments resounded with questions in the form of verses, {{page:{number:68,folio:F.287.b}}} each of which was clearly answered by the bodhisattvas, who replied in chorus, also in verse.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1069}} First, the instruments asked:

As soon as they had made their offerings, those necklaces transformed, through the power of the Buddha, into eighty-four thousand pavilions made of pearl, in the sky above the Blessed One’s head. All the mansions were square, supported by four pillars, well proportioned, and symmetrical. Inside those pavilions, thrones studded with jewels set on bases made of precious substances appeared, and many layers of divine fabrics were spread upon them. Thus-gone ones adorned with the thirty-two major marks of great beings sat upon these thrones.

Blessed One, please tell us about the qualities that will enable us to leave behind these female bodies, acquire male bodies, and awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1503}} “Sisters,” replied the Blessed One, “listen carefully and pay attention. I shall now explain to you how to leave behind your female bodies, acquire male bodies, and swiftly awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood.” The queens of the kiṃnara king agreed to this and listened as the Blessed One had directed.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1236}} The Blessed One then said, “Sisters, if women possess this one quality, they will leave behind their female bodies, acquire male bodies, {{page:{number:80,folio:F.293.b}}} and swiftly awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. {{note:{index:73,id:UT22084-058-006-1237}}} What is this one quality?

They should consider consciousness to be illusory and, realizing that the mind, the mental faculty, and awareness are like illusory displays, not develop attachment, anger, or ignorance in relation to any phenomenon. They should consider that the body is made of the four great elements —earth, water, fire, and wind. The body is a collection of parts, just like grass, trees, clods of earth, walls, or optical illusions, and it is therefore devoid of a self, a sentient being, a life principle, an individual, and a person. Rather, the body manifests through causes, deeds, and actions, as guided by delusion. Furthermore, women should correctly contemplate how the eyes are balls of flesh produced by the ingestion of food, and that they are essentially empty and naturally detached. In the same way, they should correctly perceive that the ears, the nose, the tongue, the body, and the mental faculty are essentially empty and naturally detached. Women should also relate to the body as they would to a reflection, to speech as they would to an echo, and to the mind as they would to an illusion.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1271}} The eighty-four thousand queens of the kiṃnara king Druma then prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One, who saw their good motivation and smiled. In accord with the nature of the blessed buddhas, when the Blessed One smiled, light rays radiated from his mouth in various colors—blue, yellow, red, white, violet, crystalline, and silver—and spread throughout an infinite number of universes, rising up to the abodes of Brahmā and eclipsing the light of the sun and the moon. The light rays then came back toward the Blessed One and circumambulated him three times, before vanishing into the top of his head.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1272}} At that moment, venerable Ānanda stood up, draped his shawl over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and bowed down respectfully and reverentially with his palms joined together in the direction of the Blessed One. With these verses, he then asked the Blessed One about the meaning of his smile:
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1273}} “Blissful One, why do you smile? I ask you whose face is stainless like the moon. I ask you who radiates pure majesty. {{page:{number:87,folio:F.297.a}}} I ask you who has the color of gold.

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1281}} After venerable Ānanda had uttered those verses, the Blessed One asked him, “Ānanda, did you see how the queens of the kiṃnara king Druma have generated roots of merit in relation to me? Did you see how they sincerely gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening, and how they prostrated to my feet in order to leave behind their female bodies and acquire male bodies?”
“Yes, Blessed One, I saw this.” {{page:{number:88,folio:F.297.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1283}} “Ānanda, by sincerely creating those roots of virtue, these eighty-four thousand kiṃnara queens will, after they die, leave their female bodies behind, acquire male bodies, and be reborn with the general fortune of the gods of the Heaven of Joy. Once they are born there, they will, together with the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, propagate the perfect awakening of the blessed buddhas. When Maitreya achieves the awakening of a thus-gone one, they will serve him and propagate his sacred Dharma. Then, one after the other, they will serve all the thus-gone ones of this excellent eon and propagate and uphold their sacred Dharma. They will gradually perfect all the factors of awakening that are to be accomplished. Then, when the kiṃnara king Druma awakens to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, they will be reborn in his buddha realm, and he will prophesy their unsurpassed and perfect awakening.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1284}} Then, the kiṃnara king Druma said, “Blessed One, Thus-Gone One, you have performed the deeds of a buddha for us. You have closed all the paths leading to the lower realms and cleared all the paths leading to the happy destinies. You have placed us on the path to awakening. You have revealed to us the treasure of the Dharma. You have established us at the level of wisdom. You have caused all our roots of virtue to blaze forth. You have taught us the different aspects of the perfections. You have taught us skillful means. You have granted us the opportunity to embrace the mind set on awakening. You have generated joy in us by proclaiming the Dharma. You have encouraged us to develop joy, faith, and delight. You have inspired us to rejoice in the acceptance of the profound Dharma. {{page:{number:89,folio:F.298.a}}} You have established us on the level of irreversibility. We will always remember the kindness of the Blessed One; we will never forget it! Blessed One, even with our own flesh and blood, let alone anything else, we would never be able to repay the the Thus-Gone One’s kindness.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1285}} At that moment, some bodhisattvas present in the assembly wondered, “How long will it take the kiṃnara king Druma to awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood? What will his name be? How large will his saṅgha of bodhisattvas be? What will his wealth and possessions be like? What will his array of beings and the array of qualities of his buddha realm be like?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1286}} Knowing the thoughts of those bodhisattvas, the Blessed One smiled and many hundreds of thousands of multicolored light rays radiated from his mouth, illuminating as many buddha realms in each of the ten directions as there are grains of sand in the Ganges. Those light rays allayed all the suffering of all the beings in the lower realms and inspired the world with its gods, humans, and demigods. The light rays then came back toward to the Blessed One and circumambulated him a thousand times, before vanishing into the top of his head. When he saw that smile of the Blessed One, which he had never seen before, venerable Ānanda stood up, joined his palms together, and prostrated to the Blessed One’s feet. He circumambulated him three times and knelt on his right knee in front of him. Then, bowing down with his palms joined together in the direction of the Blessed One, he uttered these verses:

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1291}} After he had offered those verses of praise to the Blessed One, venerable Ānanda circumambulated him and sat down at his seat. The Blessed One surveyed the ten directions with his elephant’s gaze and then said to venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, did you see the manner, the greatness, and the way in which the kiṃnara king Druma worshiped the Thus-Gone One?”
“Yes, Blessed One, I saw it. Blissful One, I saw it.”

As soon as they see his image, they will remember that all phenomena are similar to reflections, and whenever doubts about the Dharma arise in their minds, they will pose questions to that reflection of the Thus-Gone One. Their questions will then be answered by that thus-gone one, thus satisfying their minds. Upon hearing the Dharma, those bodhisattvas will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.

You have heard the sacred Dharma from them, and it has cleared away the darkness of your unknowing and the great cataracts of ignorance from which boundless regrets arose. {{note:{index:81,id:UT22084-058-006-1378}}} You have thus achieved the great light of Dharma that illuminates the Dharma, through which you have now reached freedom from obscuration and abide in that. You are therefore also very fortunate! Thus, Your Majesty, bodhisattva great beings should, devotedly and by all means, become vessels for the Dharma so that they never forget even a single Dharma word or letter after hearing them—so that they never squander them, but uphold them and guard them.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1379}} Then, the bodhisattva Divyamauli asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, how do bodhisattvas become vessels for the Dharma?” {{page:{number:111,folio:F.309.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1509}} “Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “if bodhisattva great beings possess thirty-two qualities, {{note:{index:82,id:UT22084-058-006-1381}}} they will be vessels for the Dharma. What are those thirty-two? Noble son, they are (1) the blessings of the buddhas—the vessel of the bodhisattvas, (2) resolve—the vessel of pure motivation, (3) application—the vessel for propagating the path of awakening, (4) pure motivation—the vessel of extraordinary roots of virtue, (5) recollection—the vessel of erudition, (6) intelligence—the vessel for entering the path, (7) understanding—the vessel for understanding the meaning, (8) generosity—the vessel of great wealth, (9) discipline—the vessel for fulfilling one’s wishes, (10) patience—the vessel for attaining the thirty-two marks of a great being, (11) diligence—the vessel for achieving all the qualities of a buddha, (12) concentration—the vessel of a capable mind, (13) insight—the vessel for completely transcending all doubts, (14) love—the vessel of an unbiased attitude toward all beings, (15) compassion—the vessel for protecting all poor and destitute beings, (16) joy—the vessel of joy in the Dharma, (17) equanimity—the vessel for abandoning attachment and aversion, (18) virtuous friends—the vessel for leading one to uphold all roots of virtue, (19) tirelessly pursuing learning—the vessel of the perfection of insight, (20) going forth—the vessel of independence, (21) remaining in the wilderness—the vessel for having few desires and possessions, (22) enjoying solitude—the vessel of concentration and higher perception, (23) the means of attracting disciples—the vessel for ripening beings, (24) upholding the sacred Dharma—the vessel of the light of the Dharma, (25) retention—the vessel for remembering everything one hears, (26) eloquence—the vessel for eliminating the doubts of all beings, (27) recollecting the Buddha—the vessel for beholding buddhas, {{page:{number:112,folio:F.309.b}}} (28) recollecting the Dharma—the vessel of the perfection of insight, (29) the absence of anger—the vessel for guarding one’s roots of virtue, (30) trusting in emptiness—the vessel for abandoning all views, (31) dependent origination—the vessel for abandoning all extreme views, (32) attaining acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena—the vessel of undisturbed and continuous teaching, and (33) the level of irreversibility—the vessel of the ten powers, the fearlessnesses, and the unique buddha qualities. Noble son, you should know that if bodhisattva great beings possess those thirty-two qualities they will be proper vessels for the Dharma.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1382}} When the Blessed One had expounded this teaching, ten thousand beings gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening and said, “Blessed One, may all beings become proper vessels for the Dharma, and may we also become such proper Dharma vessels as described by the Blessed One!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1510}} The Blessed One then said to the kiṃnara king Druma, “Lord of the kiṃnaras, your retinue might start to become weary, so you should go back to your abode.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1384}} The kiṃnara king Druma replied, “Blessed One, someone who becomes weary cannot be called a bodhisattva. Blessed One, bodhisattvas should withstand weariness. Blessed One, how are bodhisattvas to be known as wearying? How are they to be known as unwearying?”

“Yes, Blessed One, I heard it.”

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1433}} When those verses describing bodhisattva conduct manifested from the tunes of the lute, five thousand bodhisattvas reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. {{page:{number:119,folio:F.313.a}}} The retinue of King Ajātaśatru, the brahmins and householders from Rājagṛha, and eight thousand members of the retinues of the kiṃnaras, gandharvas, and mahoragas gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening. They promised, “Blessed One, we will also train in bodhisattva conduct! We will accomplish it earnestly, and we will encourage countless beings to adhere to this bodhisattva conduct!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1434}} After that, the Blessed One gave his approval for the kiṃnara king Druma to depart. Having received the Blessed One’s consent, the kiṃnara king Druma as well as his sons, troops, queens, subjects, and attendants prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One and circumambulated him three times. While bidding him farewell, they played music, caused a rain of flowers to fall, and emitted webs of light. As the earth quaked in six different ways, they left the Blessed One and in that very instant arrived back home on the majestic Mount Gandhamādana.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1435}} Śakra, lord of the gods, then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, the kiṃnara king Druma surpasses me in terms of his worship of the Thus-Gone One and the Dharma!”

Because, Kauśika, as soon as bodhisattvas give rise to the mind set on awakening, they surpass all hearers and solitary buddhas, as well as Śakra, Brahmā, and all the protectors of the world. Kauśika, this being so, bodhisattvas cannot be surpassed by the world with its gods. Wishing to surpass the bodhisattvas is the same as wishing to surpass the thus-gone ones. Why is that?

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1437}} When he heard this teaching, Śakra, lord of the gods, joined his palms together, shed tears, and exclaimed, “Alas! My wisdom is weaker than the dispassionate and unobstructed wisdom of the buddhas!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1514}} At that moment, the son of Śakra, lord of the gods, the god Kāśyapa, who was present in the assembly, said to his father, “Father, given that phenomena are completely isolated and do not have the characteristic of being involved in creation, {{note:{index:84,id:UT22084-058-006-1439}}} those who do not give rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and supreme awakening are not being compassionate toward all sentient beings. They do not attend to virtuous friends dedicated to the vast approach and they will feel regret in the future. Father, they are submerged in the faultless, their mental continuum is burned, and their seed is burned. They are not proper vessels for the Great Vehicle. What can be done?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1440}} When this teaching was given, one thousand gods among the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and supreme awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1515}} Then, the divine son Guardian of Light Rays said, “Blessed One, all the hundreds of thousands of bodhisattva acts and hardships {{page:{number:121,folio:F.314.a}}} that the Blessed One engaged in when he was practicing bodhisattva conduct in the past have become evident to me. Blessed One, please disclose a few details of how the Blessed One trained as a bodhisattva under the Thus-Gone One, the worthy one, the perfect Buddha Dīpaṃkara and how he attained acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. Blessed One, after hearing about this acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena attained by the bodhisattva, I will accomplish it in the same way and thereby attain that quality!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1441}} “Guardian of Light Rays,” replied the Blessed One, “bodhisattvas who have not generated roots of virtue will not reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena, but bodhisattvas who possess stable roots of virtue will reach this acceptance. Guardian of Light Rays, if bodhisattvas possess four qualities, they will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. What are those four? They are (1) realizing the sameness of the buddhas, (2) realizing the sameness of the Dharma, (3) realizing the sameness of the Saṅgha, and (4) realizing the sameness of the buddha realms. Divine son, if bodhisattvas possess those four qualities, they will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1442}} “Furthermore, divine son, if bodhisattvas possess four other qualities, they will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. What are those four? They are (1) reveling in emptiness through the four concentrations, (2) reveling in skillful means through the six perfections, (3) reveling in wisdom through the five higher perceptions, and (4) reveling in magical power through unimpeded wisdom. Guardian of Light Rays, if bodhisattvas possess those four qualities, they will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. {{page:{number:122,folio:F.314.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1443}} “Furthermore, Guardian of Light Rays, if bodhisattvas possess four other qualities, they will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. What are those four?

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1444}} “Furthermore, Guardian of Light Rays, if bodhisattvas possess four other qualities, they will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. What are those four?

Guardian of Light Rays, if bodhisattvas possess those four qualities, they will reach acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1445}} When this teaching on acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena was given, five thousand bodhisattvas reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena, and the divine son Guardian of Light Rays reached acceptance of phenomena concordant with the truth.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1516}} At the conclusion of this Dharma teaching, the Blessed One said to venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, did you receive this Dharma teaching on the questions of the kiṃnara king Druma—the discourse about the gateway that shows how to train by means of the perfections?” {{page:{number:123,folio:F.315.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1447}} “Blessed One,” replied Ānanda, “I have received this Dharma teaching due to the power of the Buddha. Oh! Blessed One, this Dharma teaching that establishes the profound nature, has an excellent meaning, and is adorned by excellent words, is magnificent and amazing! Blessed One, there are no Dharma gateways that have not been included by the Blessed One in this Dharma teaching. Blessed One, whatever understanding I had of the Dharma previously has now increased a hundred thousand times based on this Dharma teaching. Blessed One, I think that if hearing this Dharma teaching can cause such an understanding of the Dharma to arise in someone like me—who has limited understanding, who has the lesser capacity aimed at the faultless state of the vehicle of the hearers, and who is misguided—it is needless to say that hearing this Dharma teaching will lead to complete understanding of the Dharma for bodhisattva great beings who are proper vessels in their boundless wisdom, have capacities as vast as oceans, possess all the jewels of the Dharma, and act as spiritual friends to all beings without being asked!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1448}} “Ānanda,” said the Blessed One, “The light emitted by a single hair of the Thus-Gone One’s body eclipses all sunlight and moonlight in this great trichiliocosm. Still, Ānanda, the light emitted from all the pores of hair on the Thus-Gone One’s body does not match a hundredth fraction of the light of insight. It does not match a thousandth fraction, a hundred thousandth fraction, a millionth fraction, or a trillionth fraction. In fact, no number, fraction, enumeration, example, or illustration comes close. Why is that so? Because all light originates from the light of insight. {{page:{number:124,folio:F.315.b}}} Ānanda, if noble sons and daughters possess that light of insight—the light of insight of the thus-gone ones—they will possess the light of insight by which the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas know the thoughts and concepts of all past, present, and future beings. Ānanda, you should know that those who listen to this Dharma teaching, develop trust in it, keep it in mind, hold it, read it, comprehend it, fully teach it to others, correctly understand it, and practice it accordingly are sublime beings who will never forget the mind set on awakening but will exert themselves in ripening beings. They will don the armor of great love and compassion, defeat demons and opponents, and proceed toward the seat of awakening.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1449}} Then venerable Ānanda asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, how much merit is generated by a noble son or daughter who is devoted to this Dharma teaching upon hearing it, who keeps it in mind, holds it, reads it, comprehends it, and fully teaches it to others?”
“Ānanda,” replied the Blessed One, “imagine that a noble son or daughter practices generosity by, in the morning, filling this entire great trichiliocosm with the seven precious substances and offering this to the stream enterers, the once returners, the nonreturners, the worthy ones, the solitary buddhas, and the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas. Similarly, imagine that he or she practices generosity by filling, at noon, during the afternoon, {{page:{number:125,folio:F.316.a}}} at dusk, during nighttime, and at dawn, all the worlds of the great trichiliocosm with the seven precious substances and offering this to all of them. Then, imagine that he or she practices generosity on that scale for a year, for a hundred years, for a thousand years, and for a hundred thousand years. What do you think Ānanda, would that noble son or daughter generate a lot of merit on that basis?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1451}} “Blessed One, the amount of merit generated would be huge! It would be immeasurable! Blissful One, the merit generated would be boundless! Blessed One, the heap of merit generated from doing this for one day is immeasurable, to say nothing of the heap of merit generated by practicing such generosity for a hundred thousand years!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1452}} “Ānanda, think about this and understand this point: if someone who strives to reach awakening, to turn the wheel of Dharma, and to liberate beings is devoted to this Dharma teaching upon hearing it, and then keeps it in mind, holds it, reads it, and comprehends it, such a noble son or daughter who follows the Great Vehicle will generate an amount of merit larger than that. That being so, what need is there to mention the merit generated by those who put it into practice in accordance with reality?! Why is that? Because, Ānanda, keeping in mind even a single verse of four lines from this Dharma teaching, holding it, reading it, comprehending it, and fully teaching it to others is known as generosity , and that generosity surpasses all other forms of generosity. Generosity with the Dharma is the supreme form of generosity, assistance with the Dharma is the supreme form of assistance, the act of spreading the Dharma is the supreme form of action, {{page:{number:126,folio:F.316.b}}} and the acquisition of the Dharma is the supreme form of acquisition. Why is that so? Because, Ānanda, generosity with the Dharma will cause afflictions to decrease while generosity with material things will merely support the body. Therefore, Ānanda, bodhisattvas who wish to reduce their afflictions should practice generosity with the Dharma authorized by the Buddha. Through this generosity with the Dharma, all extraordinary qualities will be attained.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1453}} “The bodhisattvas who practice generosity with the Dharma will gain thirty-two excellent and valuable benefits. What are those thirty-two? (1) They will develop mindfulness. (2) They will develop intelligence. (3) They will develop understanding. (4) Their desires will decrease. (5) Their anger will decrease. (6) Their ignorance will decrease. (7) They will overcome the afflictions in themselves and others. (8) They will please many beings. (9) The gods will proclaim their praises. (10) They will be protected by gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and gandharvas. (11) They will receive alms after performing service. (12) They will receive Dharma robes, alms, bedding, medicine, and provisions. (13) Their renown, repute, and praise will spread in the ten directions. (14) They will not be harmed by nonhumans. (15) They will be praised by the blessed buddhas. (16) They will guard the sacred Dharma. (17) They will uphold the sacred Dharma of the blessed buddhas. (18) They will not be frightened by any of the lower realms. (19) It will not be difficult for them to be reborn as gods and humans. (20) They will continuously behold the buddhas. (21) They will continuously venerate the Saṅgha. {{page:{number:127,folio:F.317.a}}} (22) They will remember their previous lives. (23) They will be reborn into pure buddha realms. (24) They will never be born with impaired faculties. (25) They will attain the thirty-two major marks of great beings. (26) They will manifest the seeds of magnificent retention. (27) They will acquire the cause of uninterrupted eloquence. (28) They will be served by wise beings. (29) They will acquire the cause of great insight. (30) They will quickly attain the light of the Dharma. (31) Improper contemplation will not arise in their minds. (32) They will surpass all forms of mundane generosity related to material things and acquire the inexhaustible Dharma treasure. Ānanda, if bodhisattvas practice generosity with the Dharma, they will acquire those thirty-two excellent and extraordinary qualities.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1454}} Then, Śakra, lord of the gods, said to the Blessed one, “Blessed One, I will also uphold this Dharma teaching! After the Blessed One has passed into nirvāṇa, I will ensure that beings who are proper recipients hear it. I will guard them and ensure that they have faith in it. Why? Because, Blessed One, I am pursuing those excellent qualities and the accumulation of merit.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1455}} At that moment, the Blessed One applauded Śakra, lord of the gods. He said, “Kauśika, the lion’s roar by which you have vowed in front of me to uphold the sacred Dharma is excellent, excellent! Kauśika, as long as my sacred Dharma endures, whenever the gods and the demigods are fighting, this root of virtue will cause the demigods to be defeated and the gods to be victorious in battle. This, Kauśika, is due to the fact that this Dharma teaching is excellent. Kauśika, {{page:{number:128,folio:F.317.b}}} not apprehending any phenomenon is the gift of fearlessness. Kauśika, whenever the slightest fear arises, it invariably originates in apprehending and dwelling on the view of the transitory collection. Kauśika, those who are free from apprehension uphold the sacred Dharma.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1456}} Brahmā, lord of the Sahā world, then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, I will renounce the limitless modes of dwelling in the bliss of concentration, and I will go to listen to the Dharma in all the villages, cities, towns, provinces, countries, and royal capitals where this Dharma teaching is practiced. In those places, I will protect, guard, and support all those who preach the Dharma rightfully. Why? Because, Blessed One, the hearers, the solitary buddhas, Śakra, Brahmā, the protectors of the world, and the universal monarchs originate from this Dharma.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1457}} The four great kings then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, we, the four great kings, and the great hearers of the Blessed One, will strive to protect, guard, and support this Dharma teaching to ensure that it endures for a long time. Our retinues will ensure that those who do not trust the Buddha and his teachings develop faith and exert themselves for the sake of protecting the teaching of the Thus-Gone One. Blessed One, we will now recite the following secret mantra words to protect the monks, nuns, and male and female lay practitioners who exert themselves in the teachings of the Buddha, as well as those who trust and guard the teaching of the Blessed One. These secret mantra words will subjugate beings such as yakṣas, rākṣasas, gandharvas, kiṃnaras, {{page:{number:129,folio:F.318.a}}} mahoragas, and kumbhāṇḍas, as well as humans, nonhumans, and all those who are hostile toward the teaching of the Buddha:

{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1461}} Then, the Blessed One said to the bodhisattvas Maitreya and Divyamauli, “Sublime beings, I entrust and place in your hands this awakening that I have accomplished over countless eons, to ensure that it endures for a long time without vanishing.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1517}} They both replied, “Blessed One, after the Blessed One has passed into nirvāṇa, we shall both uphold and propagate this Dharma teaching. We shall place this Dharma teaching in the hands of those who teach the Dharma and those noble sons and daughters who have created roots of virtue. We shall look after them to make sure that they trust and uphold this discourse. Blessed One, in the future, when beings hear this Dharma teaching and keep it in mind, hold it, read it, comprehend it, and carry it, it will be known to be due to the blessings of the bodhisattvas Maitreya and Divyamauli.”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1463}} At that moment, the evil Māra, who was present in the assembly, started to shed tears and wail. He said to the Blessed One, {{page:{number:130,folio:F.318.b}}} “Blessed One, your Dharma teachings, starting with the vehicle of the hearers, have never ever given me goosebumps. However, this Dharma teaching that the Blessed One has taught—the seal of the bodhisattvas blessed by the thus-gone ones, the entrance to the path of awakening of all bodhisattvas, the support for all beings—has caused me such painful misery and made me weak! Blessed One, please reach out to me! Please stop expounding this Dharma teaching that causes me such painful misery!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1464}} “Evil One,” replied the Blessed One, “there are many beings like you who do not trust such a profound teaching, and there are only a few who do, so do not be distressed and stop wailing! Evil One, for example, beings who trust this profound Dharma teaching are as many as a pinch of dust taken from the surface of the earth, while beings who are not devoted to this profound Dharma teaching are as numerous as all the particles of dust on the entire earth. All those beings are like you; all the beings from innumerable realms are like you, so you should be happy, Evil One!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1465}} When this Dharma teaching was delivered, countless beings set out for awakening, ninety-two thousand bodhisattvas reached acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena, eighty-four thousand beings purified the spotless and stainless Dharma eye with respect to phenomena, and the minds of eight thousand monks became free from defilements without any further appropriation. This great trichiliocosm shook in six ways and was bathed in a dazzling light. A rain of divine flowers fell from the sky, and the melodies of hundreds of thousands of instruments resounded everywhere, without anyone playing them.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1466}} Billions of gods residing in the sky exclaimed, {{page:{number:131,folio:F.319.a}}} “Oh, we have just witnessed a second turning of the wheel of Dharma in Jambudvīpa! The benefit for beings that has been accomplished by the Blessed One revealing and explaining this Dharma teaching is far greater than that of the turning of the Dharma wheel in the city of Vārāṇasī—and the maturation of beings is also greater! All the beings who will retain this Dharma teaching and hold it, read it, comprehend it, fully teach it to others, or even write it down and carry it, will also be turning the wheel of Dharma!”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1467}} Then, the bodhisattva Maitreya, the bodhisattva Divyamauli, and venerable Ānanda asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, what is the name of this Dharma teaching? How should it be remembered?”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1518}} “Noble sons,” replied the Blessed One, “you should remember this Dharma teaching as The Questions of the Kiṃnara King Druma—The Definitive Teaching on the Perfections . You should also remember it as The Precious Chapter on the Sacred Dharma .”
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1519}} When the Blessed One had spoken, the bodhisattva Maitreya, the bodhisattva Divyamauli, venerable Ānanda, and the world with its gods, humans, and demigods, rejoiced in the words of the Blessed One and were delighted.
{{milestone:UT22084-058-006-1469}} This concludes the Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra “ The Questions of the Kiṃnara King Druma .”
