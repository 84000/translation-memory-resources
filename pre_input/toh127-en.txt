{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-114}} They honored him, {{note:{index:33,id:UT22084-055-001-115}}} worshiped him, {{note:{index:34,id:UT22084-055-001-116}}} revered him, {{note:{index:35,id:UT22084-055-001-117}}} made offerings to him, {{note:{index:36,id:UT22084-055-001-118}}} praised him, {{note:{index:37,id:UT22084-055-001-119}}} and venerated him. {{note:{index:38,id:UT22084-055-001-120}}} The fourfold assembly and the worlds {{note:{index:39,id:UT22084-055-001-121}}} of devas also paid homage to him, {{note:{index:40,id:UT22084-055-001-122}}} made offerings to him, honored him, worshiped him, revered him, praised him, and venerated him.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-123}} Then the Bhagavān, encircled and esteemed by that assembly of many hundred thousands, taught the Dharma. He taught perfectly the spiritual conduct that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, that has a good meaning, that has good words, and is unalloyed, complete, pure, and wholesome.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-124}} At that time, within that gathered assembly there was a youth {{note:{index:41,id:UT22084-055-001-125}}} named Candraprabha, who had honored the jinas in the past, had planted roots of merit, could remember his previous lives, had the confidence of speech, had correctly followed the Mahāyāna, and who was dedicated to great compassion.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-126}} The youth Candraprabha rose from his seat, removed his robe from one shoulder, {{page:{number:4,folio:F.3.a}}} and, kneeling on his right knee, with palms placed together bowed toward the Bhagavān and made this request: “If the Bhagavān will give me an opportunity to seek answers to them, I have a few questions for the Bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha.”
The Bhagavān addressed the youth Candraprabha, saying, “Young man, ask whatever question you wish of the Tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha, and I shall gratify you with answers to each and every question you have asked.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-128}} “Young man, I am omniscient. {{note:{index:42,id:UT22084-055-001-129}}} I am all-seeing. I have attained preeminence because of my strengths and fearlessness concerning all Dharmas. I possess the unobscured wisdom of liberation.
“Young man, there is nothing in the endless, infinite worlds {{note:{index:43,id:UT22084-055-001-131}}} that the Tathāgata does not know, has not seen, has not heard, has not understood, has not directly perceived, and about which he has not become completely enlightened.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-132}} “Young man, may you always have the opportunity to ask questions of the Tathāgata, and I will gratify you with answers for each of the questions you ask.”
The Bhagavān having given him this opportunity, the young man Candraprabha {{note:{index:44,id:UT22084-055-001-134}}} recited these verses to the Bhagavān:
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-135}} “Lord of the World, Buddha, Illuminator, bringer of benefit, Elucidate what kind of practice Will bring the attainment of inconceivable wisdom. {1}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-136}} “Lord of humans, speaker of the truth, preeminent among humans, To whom humans and devas make offerings, how should one practice In order to attain the unfathomable, {{note:{index:45,id:UT22084-055-001-137}}} supreme, highest yāna?

{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-148}} “How does one not abandon correct conduct? How does one not depart from dhyāna? How does one stay in a solitary place? How does wisdom increase? {{note:{index:51,id:UT22084-055-001-149}}} {7}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-150}} “How does one find joy in maintaining correct conduct Within the vast teaching of the one with ten strengths? How can the aggregate of correct conduct be flawless? How does one examine the nature of the composite? {8}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-151}} “How can the wise be pure In body and in speech, And with an unafflicted mind Seek the Buddha’s wisdom? {9}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-152}} “How can they have pure actions of the body? How can they avoid faults in speech? How can they have an unafflicted mind? Best of men, give your answer to my questions.” {10}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-153}} The Bhagavān said to the youth Candraprabha, “Young man, bodhisattva mahāsattvas will attain all those qualities and quickly attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood if they have one quality. {{note:{index:52,id:UT22084-055-001-154}}} What is that one quality? Young man, it is the bodhisattva mahāsattvas’ evenness of mind toward all beings. They wish to benefit them, have no anger, and have no partiality. Young man, if bodhisattva mahāsattvas have that one quality {{page:{number:6,folio:F.4.a}}} they will attain all those qualities and quickly attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.”
The Bhagavān then recited these verses to the youth Candraprabha:
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-156}} “Having obtained one quality, Those bodhisattvas, whoever they are, Will attain these qualities And quickly attain enlightenment. {11}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-157}} “Anger toward anyone does not arise in the mind Of the bodhisattva who has a mind without anger. Those who are not hardhearted or wicked Will attain exactly what has been described. {12}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-158}} “As they remain in evenness of mind, There will be an evenness of ripening results: The soles of their feet will be even And their range of conduct will be even. {13}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-159}} “They meditate with even minds that are without unevenness. Without the fault of hardheartedness and devoid of craving They have even soles and palms. {{note:{index:53,id:UT22084-055-001-160}}} They are supremely bright and are seen as pure. {14}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-161}} “The bodhisattvas illuminate the ten directions, Spreading splendor and light through a buddha realm. {{note:{index:54,id:UT22084-055-001-162}}} When they attain the level of peace, They establish many beings in buddha wisdom. {15}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-163}} “Young man, in that way the bodhisattva mahāsattva who has evenness of mind toward all beings, wishes to benefit them, and has no anger or partiality will attain the samādhi known as the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomena.

{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-948}} Then Candraprabha, full of joy and happiness and the knowledge of the countless, vast number of beings in the deva realms, and the scope of experience of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, rose from his seat, removed his robe from one shoulder, and, kneeling on his right knee, with palms placed together, he bowed toward the Bhagavān and recited these appropriate verses of praise:
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-949}} “I pay homage to you, the unsurpassable provider of freedom from fear. I pay homage to you, a loving friend of beings who benefits others. I pay homage to you, who possess the power of truth and the ten strengths. I pay homage to you, who are the equal of the unequaled tathāgatas. {iii}

{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-953}} “I will always go for refuge to you, Lord, The Jina who is a sun shining in the center of the vast sky of wisdom, Dispelling darkness with the light of love and compassion, And who is the teacher of the extremely profound Dharma of the ultimate truth.” {v} {{page:{number:58,folio:F.30.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-954}} When the youth Candraprabha had recited these appropriate verses of praise to the Bhagavān, he said to him, “Bhagavān, so that you may show me your compassion I pray that you, with your saṅgha of bodhisattvas and saṅgha of bhikṣus, will assent to eat your meal tomorrow at my home.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-955}} “I pray to the Lord of men and your sons That you eat a pure meal at my home. Lord of sages, in order to show me your compassion, Chief of devas, give your assent.” {vi}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-956}} The Bhagavān, because of his compassion, by remaining silent assented to eat a meal together with his saṅgha of bodhisattvas and saṅgha of bhikṣus at the home of the youth Candraprabha.

{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1652}} Conclusion of the sixteenth chapter, “The Past.”
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1653}} When the Bhagavān had finished speaking, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, who was seated there, in his mind recited this verse to the Bhagavān. {{note:{index:636,id:UT22084-055-001-1654}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1655}} “I am going, Tathāgata, {{note:{index:637,id:UT22084-055-001-1656}}} to the king of mountains, Gṛdhrakūṭa, which is always the residence of the buddhas. When I have gone there, lamp of the world, {{note:{index:638,id:UT22084-055-001-1657}}} I will make inconceivable offerings to you.” {i}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1658}} The Bhagavān knew the thoughts that were in the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya’s mind, and from his own mind sent this verse to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya:
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1659}} “Go, Ajita, you who have conquered the māras, {{note:{index:639,id:UT22084-055-001-1660}}} To the king of mountains where jinas reside. There you will quickly accomplish A great unsurpassable benefit for beings.” {ii}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1661}} So the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, having received in his mind that verse from the Bhagavān, paid homage to the Bhagavān in his mind and, again in his mind, circumambulated him three times. He then left the assembly and went to Gṛdhrakūṭa, the king of mountains, which has been the residence of countless buddhas, as numerous as the grains of sand in the ocean, and where there is a great caitya.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1662}} The moment he arrived there, for the enjoyment of the Bhagavān, he magically transformed the king of mountains to become level and vast, without any tree stumps, thorns, stones, pebbles, or gravel, and with a surrounding wall made of the seven jewels. The ground was composed of countless shining sapphire jewels and was adorned by divine adornments and jewels, all of them beyond compare, and beautified by an array of innumerable, different kinds of jewels. All the area was decorated by the clothing of Tuṣita devas, {{page:{number:107,folio:F.54.b}}} pervaded by the aroma of incense from a variety of censers, adorned by garlands and wreaths, scattered with various flowers; it resounded with the sound of divine music, was filled with erect and fluttering banners and flags, and over it canopies were suspended.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1663}} In the center of this area a divine lion throne made from the seven jewels was emanated. It was draped in cloth that was not woven, and covered with divine clothing from Tuṣita that was as soft and pleasant to the touch as down. A central awning hung above, and there were two red cushions placed upon it. It was a yojana wide and a yojana high.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1664}} Its beautiful footstool, made of Jambu River gold, transcended that of humans and devas. It was covered with a net of strings of pearls, and it was draped in divine, precious cottons.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1665}} Strung upon the lion throne were strings of divine, precious bells from which came clear, beautiful, gentle sounds. In all directions there were great shining jewels. And there was emanated a precious, vast parasol, with a handle made of a great, precious jewel of stainless beryl.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1666}} The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya now emanated an inconceivable, adorning array of various jewels on Gṛdhrakūṭa, the king of mountains, and in its entire environs. Then, in an instant, he returned to the home of the youth Candraprabha.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1667}} Once he was back there, in his mind he paid homage to the Bhagavān, and in his mind circumambulated him three times. He then sat on his seat.
It was said:
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1669}} He manifested the mountain as a divine, vast place With excellent, beautiful jewel flagstones— Inconceivable, divine, formed from the mind— And he placed in the center a precious lion throne. {iii}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1670}} Jinaputra Ajita also manifested A divine, splendid parasol that emitted delightful sounds With great shining jewels all around, And a handle of pure, beautiful beryl. {iv}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1671}} Maitreya, the hero, having emanated A variety of jewels on the mountain, And a precious seat that was a krośa in size, {{page:{number:108,folio:F.55.a}}} In one instant returned to the house. {{note:{index:640,id:UT22084-055-001-1672}}} {v}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1673}} Then the Bhagavān taught the Dharma to the great assembly that was like an ocean. He inspired them, he filled them with joy, and he guided them. Then he rose from his seat and departed. And with the miraculous power of a buddha he emerged through Rājagṛha’s gate of the hot springs and proceeded toward Gṛdhrakūṭa, the king of mountains. When he arrived he went to the site created by Maitreya, and having arrived there he sat upon the great lion throne that Maitreya had manifested. {{note:{index:641,id:UT22084-055-001-1674}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1675}} He was encircled by the assembly of bhikṣus, and the saṅgha of bodhisattvas gazed upon him from the front. The devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, rishis, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans paid homage to him. Within the ocean-like assembly, he taught the Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1676}} Then the youth Candraprabha arrived together with a hundred thousand quintillion beings, and many millions of bodhisattva mahāsattvas who had come from other worlds. They were holding flowers, incense, and garlands; playing musical instruments and percussion; holding parasols, banners, and divine flags; and holding great garlands as offerings.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1677}} In order to make this offering to the Bhagavān they left the great city of Rājagṛha through the gateway of peace, {{note:{index:642,id:UT22084-055-001-1678}}} and went to Gṛdhrakūṭa, to the Bhagavān. They bowed down their heads to the Bhagavān’s feet, circumambulated him three times, made a great offering to him of flowers, incense, perfume, garlands, ointments, powders, clothes, food, parasols, banners, and flags, playing music and percussion, and then they sat down in one place. In order to ask about the Dharma they sat in that place with veneration and with respect while the youth Candraprabha, kneeling on his right knee, {{page:{number:109,folio:F.55.b}}} with palms placed together, bowed toward the Bhagavān {{note:{index:643,id:UT22084-055-001-1679}}} and said to him, “If the Bhagavān will give me an opportunity to seek answers to them, I have a few questions for the Bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha.”
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1680}} The Bhagavān addressed the youth Candraprabha, saying, “Young man, the Bhagavān will always give you the opportunity. Ask whatever question you wish to the Tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha.”
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1681}} The Bhagavān having given him this opportunity, the young man Candraprabha asked, “Bhagavān, it is through possessing what qualities that bodhisattva mahāsattvas attain the samādhi, the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomena ?”
The Bhagavān replied to Candraprabha, “Young man, if bodhisattva mahāsattvas possess four qualities, they will attain the samādhi, the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomena.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1683}} “What are those four qualities? Young man, one is that bodhisattva mahāsattvas are calm, and pleasant company. They have self-restraint, and have attained a level of self-restraint such that when others abuse them or insult them, they will be patient with the abuse and the insults that are spoken, for it is their nature to have endurance; they have the view of karma, have overcome pride, and their desire is for the Dharma. Young man, if bodhisattva mahāsattvas have this first quality, they will attain this samādhi. {{note:{index:644,id:UT22084-055-001-1684}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1685}} “Another, young man, is that bodhisattva mahāsattvas have correct conduct.

{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-1692}} “Moreover, young man, bodhisattva mahāsattvas have faith. {{note:{index:650,id:UT22084-055-001-1693}}} They insatiably seek the Dharma.

{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-3577}} The Bhagavān addressed Brother Ānanda, saying, “That is why, Ānanda, I am seated upon this seat.

{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-3578}} Brother Ānanda then said to the Bhagavān: “Bhagavān, I have been given the opportunity. Sugata, I have been given the opportunity to receive answers to my questions.”

What is the cause and what are the factors for that?”
The Bhagavān replied to Brother Ānanda, “Ānanda, in order to truly accomplish the highest, complete enlightenment, I experienced every kind of suffering. You know and remember this, so what made you decide to ask the Tathāgata this question? {{page:{number:250,folio:F.126.a}}}

Would that person, while he was still burning, encounter, be provided with, delight in, enjoy, and indulge in the five sensory pleasures?”
“No, Bhagavān, he would not,” replied Ānanda.
{{milestone:UT22084-055-001-3583}} The Bhagavān continued, “Ānanda, consider whether that person, while still burning, could encounter, be provided with, delight in, enjoy, and indulge in the five sensory pleasures.
