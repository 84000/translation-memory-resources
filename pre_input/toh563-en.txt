{{milestone:UT22084-090-007-10}} {{page:{number:1,folio:F.150.b}}} Homage to the Three Jewels! Homage to the Buddha! Homage to the Dharma! Homage to the Saṅgha! Homage to the seven perfectly and completely awakened buddhas, along with their śrāvakas—those who have perfectly gone, and those who have perfectly entered!
{{milestone:UT22084-090-007-11}} Following this homage:
May these incantations be practiced for a purpose! May these incantations be accomplished! May their purpose—the goal for which they are practiced— Be accomplished!
{{milestone:UT22084-090-007-12}} Thus have I heard at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in the Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s grove in Śrāvastī. At that time, Brahmā, master of the Sahā world, with the gods of the Brahmā realm; Śakra, lord of the gods, with the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three; the four great kings, with the gods of their realm; the twenty-eight great yakṣa generals; and Hārītī with her children and retinue of servants went before the Blessed One, bowed their heads at his feet, and stood to one side.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-007-13}} Standing there, Brahmā, master of the Sahā world, bowed toward the Blessed One with palms joined, and said, “Venerable Blessed One, I rule as lord over the realms of the chiliocosm. {{page:{number:2,folio:F.151.a}}} Venerable Blessed One, when needed I guard, protect, look after, and bring peace and well-being to the realms in the chiliocosm. Venerable Bliss-Gone Dharma Sovereign, Blessed One, you rule as lord over the realms of the great trichiliocosm. Blessed One, when you see fit you, too, guard, protect, look after, and bring peace and well-being to the realms of the great trichiliocosm. So, Venerable Blessed One, I request you to guard, protect, look after, and bring peace and well-being to the realms of the trichiliocosm!”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-007-14}} The Blessed One acquiesced by remaining silent. Brahmā, master of the Sahā world, understood that the Buddha had acquiesced by his silence, and at that moment he vanished.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-007-15}} Subsequently, the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, last night I was approached by Brahmā, master of the Sahā world, along with the gods of the Brahmā realm; Śakra, lord of the gods, with the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three; the four great kings, with the gods of the realm of the four great kings; and the twenty-eight great yakṣa generals; and Hārītī with her children and retinue of servants also came.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-007-16}} “Brahmā, master of the Sahā world, said to me, ‘Venerable Blessed One, I rule as lord over the realms of the chiliocosm. Venerable Blessed One, when needed, I guard, protect, look after, and bring peace and well-being to the realms in the chiliocosm. {{page:{number:3,folio:F.151.b}}} Venerable Bliss-Gone Dharma Sovereign, Blessed One, you rule as lord over the realms of the great trichiliocosm. Blessed One, when you see fit, you also guard, protect, look after, and bring peace and well-being to the realms of the great trichiliocosm. So, Venerable Blessed One, I request you to guard, protect, look after, and bring peace and well-being to the realms of the trichiliocosm!’
{{milestone:UT22084-090-007-17}} “Monks, I acquiesced by not responding to Brahmā, master of the Sahā world. Then Brahmā, master of the Sahā world, knowing that I had acquiesced by remaining silent, disappeared at that moment.
{{milestone:UT22084-090-007-18}} “Monks, this queen of incantations, Great Upholder of the Secret Mantra , was taught by the perfectly and completely awakened thus-gone arhats of the past. It will be taught by the perfectly and completely awakened thus-gone arhats in the future. And likewise, right now in the present, I will also teach it as an aid for the awakening of buddhahood.”
{{milestone:UT22084-090-007-19}} Then the Blessed One said to venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, you are to receive, hold, recite, preach, and master this queen of incantations, Great Upholder of the Secret Mantra ! Ānanda, this queen of incantations, Great Upholder of the Secret Mantra, will bring welfare, benefit, happiness, and comfort to the four assemblies.
