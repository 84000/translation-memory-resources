{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-9}} The Thus-Gone One has spoken Of his past lives as a bodhisattva. As these stories have been carefully collected, Listen now with a faithful mind.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-10}} Once, when the perfect Buddha, the god of gods, The Thus-Gone One, was still alive, Some monks sought to get the better of each other, Through rhetoric and other means.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-11}} The Great Sage overheard The negative words uttered by the monks. So the Sage summoned the saṅgha And told everyone,
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-12}} “You inflict harm on one another By rhetoric and other means. Such actions are not suitable For those who have gone forth from home to homelessness.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-13}} “Engage in six practices That are sure to always bring joy. These are suitable For those who have gone forth from home to homelessness.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-14}} “Monks, hear from me How I cultivated nonviolence And strove for awakening, Out of compassion for all beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-15}} “Wise persons who have heard this Will avoid negative actions, And for the sake of success and happiness, Will engage in virtuous deeds.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-16}} “Once, there were two nāga kings Who were brothers. {{page:{number:2,folio:F.205.a}}} The first was called Drum, And the second, Tambour.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-17}} “They both abstained from killing, upheld morality, And were known to possess great powers. Displeased with their birth as nāgas, They yearned for a human existence.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-18}} “Whenever they came across ascetics and priests Who were disciplined and learned, They transformed themselves into humans, To offer their service and respect.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-19}} “Twice a month, whether on the eighth, fourteenth, Or fifteenth day, They practiced the rite of restoring vows Involving the eight precepts.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-20}} “The two left their former home And journeyed to a new land, Where there lived, not far away, A nāga named Drumbeat.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-21}} “Sensing the arrival Of the two fine nāga brothers, His mind was filled with arrogance and anger, And he belched out a cloud of smoke.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-22}} “ ‘You two are not engaged in Dharma, But are deceitful, undisciplined hypocrites,’ he said. Drumbeat harassed them repeatedly With hurtful words such as these.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-23}} “Hearing abuse from someone as lowly as he, Tambour grew enraged. To his elder brother Drum, He explained the things he had heard.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-24}} “ ‘O Drum, in this world of humans, Hurtful words that cause much harm are spoken. This toad-eater, born on the bank of a stream, Is driving us away with venomous fangs.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-25}} “ ‘He harms both the animals who live in water And the humans who live on land. O Lord, though I may possess patience, My mind cannot tolerate such abusive words.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-26}} “ ‘Let us now lay waste to his city, His palace, and his relatives and attendants. Having overthrown Drumbeat, Let us then take leave of this place.’
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-27}} “Hearing the words of his younger brother, The mighty nāga king Instructed him By uttering these pleasing verses:
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-28}} “ ‘Do not foster malice toward one In whose home you have stayed for few days, Or from whom you have received food and drink— The virtue of gratitude is extolled by sublime beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-29}} “ ‘You would not cut off the leaves Of a tree that has provided you shade, No matter how briefly; {{page:{number:3,folio:F.205.b}}} Need we say anything of its trunk or branches?
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-30}} “ ‘Trees of the forest, whether felled or burned, Will grow again—of this there is no doubt. But just as hands, when chopped off, do not grow back, One who is hostile to his friends will find no lasting happiness.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-31}} “ ‘A bad person will abandon his friends, No matter how long he is shown respect, Or served delicious food and drink— He is like an elephant in a grass hut.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-32}} “ ‘Just as the trees on riverbanks will fall, Persons who are deceptive and unreliable Do not enjoy lasting friendship— They are like white cloth simmered in plant dye.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-33}} “ ‘Should the wise desire To cause displeasure to their enemies, They must free their minds from negativities, For this hurts them just as much.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-34}} “ ‘The oceans, mountains, and lands Do not weigh us down. But not repaying kindness Does, in fact, weigh us down.

{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-36}} “ ‘The Dharma is joyful, and love is joyful, Like a river with pleasant banks. Similarly, those who rid themselves of pride and arrogance And do not begrudge friends are indeed joyful.

{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-40}} “ ‘If you leave your country and home, And travel to a foreign land, You must cultivate strong patience To counter all harsh words.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-41}} “ ‘If suffering abuse in your own land, It is better to live in the lands of others; Because wherever you are not abused Is your land, and they are your people. {{page:{number:4,folio:F.206.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-42}} “ ‘Excellent beings, when subjected to abuse, Give up beautiful wives and vast wealth. Immoral ones, however, are entangled in these, And end up drenched with abuse.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-43}} “ ‘Because prosperity is rare {{note:{index:4,id:UT22084-072-025-132}}} While poverty is abundant, When people face ruin, Just keep quiet and you will find joy.

{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-97}} “ ‘For the sake of their limbs, people will give up money; And for the sake of their lives, they will give up their limbs. Yet, to practice the Dharma, one must give away everything— Wealth, limbs, and even one’s life. {{page:{number:9,folio:F.208.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-98}} “ ‘Those practicing the Dharma will have no fear. Those practicing the Dharma will not go to the lower realms. Those practicing the Dharma will go wherever they wish. Those not practicing the Dharma will die and suffer.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-99}} “ ‘The learned take no joy in gaining wealth, Nor do they lose their minds when it runs out. The ability to move easily wherever one wants in the world Is what makes humans so special among all its beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-100}} “ ‘Those who happily give to others, Abandon arrogance and harm, remain truthful, And possess oceanic minds Are indeed courageous, valorous, courteous, and skillful.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-101}} “ ‘Whoever trains in all these things Will become learned in all subjects. Such gentle and amiable people Will be praised by sublime beings.’
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-102}} “Tambour then replied, ‘O Drum, as time has passed, My faith in you has greatly increased. Whether my body becomes emaciated,
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-103}} “ ‘Or I lose my senses, I care not! Even if I fall into unbearable suffering, I shall not commit negativities in the future. Rather than living with impaired discipline,
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-104}} “ ‘It is better to die with my discipline intact. Therefore, within a single lifetime, I will train correctly and untiringly.’ ” The Blessed One continued,
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-105}} “In the past, wherever I dwelled, And wherever I was born, I wound up committing negative deeds Due to keeping all sorts of negative company.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-106}} “Once I met a spiritual friend, I abandoned negative deeds And so I eradicated negative karma.” {{note:{index:5,id:UT22084-072-025-107}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-108}} The Blessed Thus-Gone One Knows the realities of all former lives. Therefore, the Sage now turned to the monks And spoke these words:
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-109}} “In the past, I was Drum, Ānanda was Tambour, and Devadatta was Drumbeat. Remember our past lives in this fashion.”
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-110}} Having heard this meaningful discourse That condenses the entire Dharma, All the monks respectfully engaged In the practice of the Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-072-025-111}} This completes The Verses of Nāga King Drum.
