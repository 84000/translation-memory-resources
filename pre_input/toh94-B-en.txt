{{milestone:{label:2.A.2,id:UT22084-045-001-685}}} The Blessed One answered the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja in the following way: {{page:{number:190,id:UT22084-045-001-14045,folio:F.96.a}}} “Prāmodyarāja, except for the four thus-gone ones who in this Good Eon have already awakened to perfect buddhahood, all the rest of those who will awaken to perfect buddhahood in this Good Eon are present within this retinue of bodhisattva great beings, and they have attained those absorptions, those applications of the perfections, and those eighty-four thousand gateways of absorption.”
{{milestone:{label:2.A.3,id:UT22084-045-001-686}}} The bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja now replied to the Blessed One, “Wonderful, wonderful! Revered Blessed One! I request that you please state the families and names of those bodhisattvas. In that way numerous people may be healed and be happy. By showing your love for the world in this way, gods and humans will be successful, healed, and happy, and the sacred Dharma will be protected and remain for a long time. In the future, the bodhisattvas will gain understanding and practice without complacency for the sake of unexcelled and perfect awakening.”
{{milestone:{label:2.A.4,id:UT22084-045-001-687}}}The Blessed One then said to the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja, “Prāmodyarāja, listen very closely and keep my words correctly in mind; I shall explain it to you.”
