{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-057-006-39}}} Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling on Vulture Peak, near Rājagṛha, a sacred site blessed by tathāgatas, a great stūpa where previous victors dwelled. It is a Dharma seat praised by bodhisattvas and a place worshiped by gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, and asuras that inspires toward roots of virtue. It is a site where tathāgatas appear and where gateways to the Dharma are promulgated, where bodhisattvas appear and where infinite qualities spring forth. 
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-057-006-40}}} In the tathāgata domain, the Blessed One had fully realized the sameness of all phenomena. He had turned the wheel of the Dharma and now commanded a vast host of well-trained disciples. He had achieved mastery over all phenomena. He knew well how to fulfill the intentions of all beings, he had discovered how to bring their faculties to the highest perfection, and he had become skillful in terminating their karmic traces. In his spontaneous and uninterrupted buddha activity, he resided in the company of a large saṅgha of sixty thousand monks. 
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-057-006-41}}} All of these monks were of noble lineage, mighty elephants who had done their duties and performed their tasks. They had laid down the burden of existence and attained their own goals for themselves. They had brought their entanglement in existence to an end. Their minds were liberated through perfect knowledge and insight, and they had brought the karmic traces of afflictive emotions to an end. These sons of the Dharma king, the Tathāgata, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-057-006-1366,folio:F.142.b}}} were skillfully established in the profound Dharma. They were emancipated through the teaching on non-objectification. They had exquisite and elegant comportments, were great objects of veneration, and were fully grounded in the tathāgata word.
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-057-006-42}}} Furthermore, the Blessed One resided in the company of a vast saṅgha of bodhisattvas. These bodhisattva mahāsattvas were all-knowing and had achieved perfection through dispassionate conduct. From a Dharma cloud of great benevolence and vast compassion, these bodhisattvas sent forth the lightning of special insight, knowledge, and liberation and rained down showers of divine nectar, through which they pleased all beings. With a disposition that encompasses everyone, like the earth, they felt affection for all sentient beings and lacked hostility. They increased the crops of the diverse factors of awakening. By sending out rays of insight brighter than the sun, they revealed that they had achieved the path of clearing away the darkness of ignorance. They opened sentient beings like lotus flowers, brought the roots of virtue to maturity, and dried up the rivers of craving. Focused on the task of knowledge, they were driven by the mighty higher knowledges and tranquil abiding. 
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-057-006-43}}} Like the moon, they displayed a waxing and waning in brightness, since their disposition embraced all beings, and they were skilled in the means to pacify and appease them; with their noble intentions like Mount Meru, the jewels of the Brahmā abodes were firmly established. They illuminated and displayed all buddhafields, which were superior in quality to our world and never buffeted by gusts of wind from any of the four directions. Like a great ocean, they were vast containers of retention and mindfulness, filled with the water of Dharma, and their precious bodhisattva conduct nourished all beings. Like the king of beasts, they had the legs of truth, a full tail of loving kindness, and eyes of tranquil abiding and special insight, and, since they were unintimidated by the profound Dharma, they subdued all adversaries. {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-057-006-1367,folio:F.143.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-057-006-44}}} Their bodhisattva conduct remained undisrupted for countless eons, so they were endowed with all qualities. Thus the Blessed One dwelled in the company of countless bodhisattva mahāsattvas including the bodhisattva mahāsattva All-Illumining and Unobstructed Gaze, the bodhisattva mahāsattva All-Revealing Continuous Display of All Buddhafields, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Intelligence in Conduct Stemming from the Tathāgata Lineage, the bodhisattva mahāsattva All-Revealing Unperturbed Subjugation through All Conduct, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Topping the Victory Banner of Endless Courage with Miraculous Melodies, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Brilliant Light Rays of the Collection of Fine Gold, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Eloquence in Language via Insight, and the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gathering of Stable and Immeasurable Merit and Insight. 
{{milestone:{label:1.8,id:UT22084-057-006-45}}} The Blessed One proceeded to teach the Dharma discourse The Gateway to Unobstructed Deliverance through the Bodhisattva Way of Life. Sixteen years had passed since the Blessed One had become fully awakened, and he knew that the sacred conduct had unfolded. He beheld the great assembly of bodhisattvas. Once he had understood these assembled bodhisattvas to be holders of the treasury of tathāgata Dharma, he thought, “Because I care deeply for the bodhisattvas, {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-057-006-1368,folio:F.143.b}}} I shall teach the Dharma discourse The Gateway to Unobstructed Deliverance through the Bodhisattva Way of Life, drawing on the magic and miraculous displays of tathāgatas, in order to lead the bodhisattva mahāsattvas to the domain of the Tathāgata.”
{{milestone:{label:1.9,id:UT22084-057-006-46}}} Then the Blessed One attained the tathāgata absorption called display of the emanation of the buddha domain exactly as it is. As soon as he had attained that absorption, by his buddha power a pavilion, a veritable buddha abode, appeared in the atmosphere between the desire realm and the form realm. This occurred due to the roots of virtue of the Tathāgata. It purified the thinking of bodhisattvas, illuminated the realms of the worlds of the ten directions, fulfilled the aspirations of countless sentient beings, eclipsed the palaces of the gods, and inspired bodhisattvas everywhere. 
{{milestone:{label:1.10,id:UT22084-057-006-47}}} This pavilion had a foundation shaped like a white beryl. It comprised mansions made of gold extracted from the Jambu River, archways of red gems, portals of emeralds, terraces constructed of jewels, and altars crafted from radiant gems. Its upper stories consisted of brightly glowing precious stones with coverings of all kinds of jewels and adorned with dangling pearl rosaries, parasols, victory banners, raised standards, and fluttering silk tassels. It was praised and as vast as the extent of the trichiliocosm. 
{{milestone:{label:1.11,id:UT22084-057-006-48}}} The pavilion was anointed with rare and precious sandalwood. It was perfumed with the enchanting fragrance of superior sandalwood. {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-057-006-1369,folio:F.144.a}}} It was scented by the noble essence of aloeswood, the best of fragrances. It was strewn with precious flowers and nāga pearls. It was adorned with flower arrangements of scattered flower petals, fine trees, and gorgeous ornaments. The pavilion was everywhere aglitter with variegated arrangements of beautiful ornaments, as many as exist in all the world systems. It also featured many strikingly beautiful lion thrones—many tens of billions, countless, of all different kinds, alluring, lofty, superb, broad, and immense.
{{milestone:{label:1.12,id:UT22084-057-006-49}}} In this world system appeared four thousand staircases framed by terraces the height of seven men and half a mile across. They were fashioned from precious sapphire and deep blue sapphire and adorned with canopies of all other manner of gems. They were festooned with golden jewels and other precious stones and enveloped by the sound of filigrees of chimes. These stairways soared from the ground level all the way up to the pavilion. They were straight and steady. Just as in this world system, such great staircases rose in all the world systems of the trichiliocosm. 
{{milestone:{label:1.13,id:UT22084-057-006-50}}} At this point the Blessed One mindfully and deliberately emerged from that state of meditative absorption. As soon as he did, the world systems of the trichiliocosm trembled six times and were brightly illuminated. Then the Blessed One was together with a host of bodhisattvas and a host of śrāvakas, the host of bodhisattvas surrounding him and the host of śrāvakas in front of and behind him. Gods and nāgas praised him and caused a great rain of flower petals. They bestowed many garments on him {{page:{number:6,id:UT22084-057-006-1370,folio:F.144.b}}} and caused a great rain of copious powders, perfumes, and lotions, all to the sound of cymbals and various melodies. The entire universe shook and lit up brightly. 
{{milestone:{label:1.14,id:UT22084-057-006-51}}} Thereupon the whole assembly departed from Vulture Peak through the might of the Buddha: his miraculous powers, miraculous displays, great leadership, blessing, splendor, benediction, and magical abilities. Many tens of millions of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas followed in order to attend the Buddha, ascending the central jewel-encrusted staircase leading to the pavilion.
{{milestone:{label:1.15,id:UT22084-057-006-52}}} Aware that the Blessed One had proceeded to the staircase, the Catur­mahā­rājakāyika gods, such as the Catur­mahā­rājas, showered clouds of divine flower petals on him in worship. They joined their palms and praised him with the following words:
{{milestone:{label:1.16,id:UT22084-057-006-53}}} “The light of the sun, the moon, fire, and jewels, and the immaculate divine light of the heavenly realms, are all outshone by the light of the Capable One, which pacifies the three lower destinies. This light razes Mount Meru and the surrounding peaks, and it illuminates the buddhafields. Therefore, we joyously take refuge in the Victor who has accomplished all aims.”
{{milestone:{label:1.17,id:UT22084-057-006-54}}} After the Catur­mahā­rājakāyika gods had praised the Blessed One with this verse, they joined the procession to attend to him. 
{{milestone:{label:1.18,id:UT22084-057-006-55}}} At this point, the gods of Trāyastriṃśa, such as Śakra, the lord of the gods, became aware that the Blessed One had proceeded to the staircase, and they showered clouds of divine perfume on him in worship. They joined their palms and {{page:{number:7,id:UT22084-057-006-1371,folio:F.145.a}}} praised him with the following words:
{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-057-006-56}}} “You attained the most excellent miraculous powers and display unrivaled emanations. 
You rose like the supreme sun pervading vast numbers of buddhafields.
The Buddha adorns all buddhafields, beautifying them with his own qualities.
Homage to the unrivaled and unmatched master of miracles!”
{{milestone:{label:1.20,id:UT22084-057-006-57}}} After the gods of Trāyastriṃśa had praised the Blessed One with this verse, they joined the procession to attend to him. 
{{milestone:{label:1.21,id:UT22084-057-006-58}}} At this point, the gods of Yāma, such as Suyāma, the king of the gods, noticed that the Blessed One was ascending the staircase, and they showered clouds of divine garments on him in worship. They joined their palms and praised him with the following words:
{{milestone:{label:1.22,id:UT22084-057-006-59}}} “Sugata, your knowledge is vast and boundless, so you know the wishes of beings.
Your omniscience, vast as space and without attachment to the threefold path teachings,{{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-057-006-60}}}
Fathoms the whole range of thoughts of sentient beings through a single mental event.
Therefore, you deserve praise from everyone in all three existences.”
{{milestone:{label:1.23,id:UT22084-057-006-61}}} After the gods of Yāma had praised the Blessed One with this verse, they joined the procession to attend to him. 
{{milestone:{label:1.24,id:UT22084-057-006-62}}} At this point, the gods of Tuṣita, such as Pramodita, the king of the gods, noticed that the Blessed One was ascending the staircase, and they showered clouds of divine jewels on him in worship. They joined their palms and praised him with the following words:
{{milestone:{label:1.25,id:UT22084-057-006-63}}} “Since phenomena are without sound or expression, without coming or going,
You know them to be without motion and untrue, like a mirage or hallucination.
The Blessed One teaches the supreme Dharma out of compassion for the sake of beings. 
We pay homage to the Victor who is skilled in the nature of phenomena and who teaches no self.” {{page:{number:8,id:UT22084-057-006-1372,folio:F.145.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.26,id:UT22084-057-006-64}}} After the gods of Tuṣita had praised the Blessed One with this verse, they joined the procession to attend to him. 
{{milestone:{label:1.27,id:UT22084-057-006-65}}} At this point, the gods of Nirmāṇarati, such as Sunirmāṇarati, the king of the gods, noticed that the Blessed One was ascending the staircase, and they showered clouds of divine ornaments on him in worship. They joined their palms and praised him with the following words:
{{milestone:{label:1.28,id:UT22084-057-006-66}}} “Through the boon of the Dharma, you possess ten space-like strengths and luminosity.
Because you possess compassion, you appear tangibly before sentient beings with loving regard.
Although you have entered the nonduality of phenomena in the manner of a ship,{{note:{index:23,id:UT22084-057-006-67}}}
We pay homage to the Victor who has accomplished all aims with a special intention enhanced by Dharma.”
{{milestone:{label:1.29,id:UT22084-057-006-68}}} After the gods of Nirmāṇarati had praised the Blessed One with this verse, they joined the procession to attend to him. 
{{milestone:{label:1.30,id:UT22084-057-006-69}}} At this point, the gods of Para­nirmitavaśavartin, such as Vaśavartin, the king of the gods, noticed that the Blessed One had ascended the staircase and was now facing the pavilion, and they showered clouds of divine pearl garlands on him in worship. They joined their palms and praised him with the following words:
{{milestone:{label:1.31,id:UT22084-057-006-70}}} “We pay homage at the feet of the master, whose moral conduct is stainless, pure, perfected, and excellent, and whose absorption is stable, 
The incomparably intelligent one who is like the ocean, who is liberated from existence.
We pay homage to you, the Lion Sugata who progressively delineates the various aspects of the true path out of compassion filled with loving kindness,
And who dwells in the way stations of the three liberations.
{{milestone:{label:1.32,id:UT22084-057-006-71}}} “We pay homage respectfully to you, Lotus Sugata
Who broadens the river of compassion through absorption, 
Who opens the petals of tranquil abiding on the flowers of liberation,
And who is attended by an assembly of disciples like swarming bees. {{page:{number:9,id:UT22084-057-006-1373,folio:F.146.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.33,id:UT22084-057-006-72}}} “We pay homage to you, Sacred Mountain Buddha
Who is established on the ground of firm moral conduct,
Who has risen up through the power of unrivaled energy,
And who is not shaken by the great tempest of the winds of objects.
{{milestone:{label:1.34,id:UT22084-057-006-73}}} “We pay homage to you, Moon Sugata 
Who is a pure maṇḍala of melodies,
Whose mind treasury of supreme intelligence is overwhelming,
And to whom hundreds of sentient beings attend with many offerings.
{{milestone:{label:1.35,id:UT22084-057-006-74}}} “We pay homage to you, Noble Sun Buddha
Who proceeds on the path of full emancipation of peace, which is like the sky, 
Who suffuses the expanse of the ten directions with the rays of insight,
And who opens the incomparable lotus flowers of many beings.
{{milestone:{label:1.36,id:UT22084-057-006-75}}} “Master, in the three worlds and ten directions
We find no guide equal to you.
You who have accomplished all the buddha qualities—
We can never get enough of praising you.
{{milestone:{label:1.37,id:UT22084-057-006-76}}} “We pay homage to you, Honorable Sugata.
The celestial rulers, nāgas, and asuras pay tribute to you,
And many hundreds of supreme gods truly extoll you.
You are truly extolled by many hundreds of eulogies.”
{{milestone:{label:1.38,id:UT22084-057-006-77}}} After the gods of Para­nirmitavaśavartin had praised the Blessed One with these verses, they joined the procession to attend to him. 
{{milestone:{label:1.39,id:UT22084-057-006-78}}} After the many gods had thus praised the vast display of the buddha domain, the Buddha entered the pavilion called Jeweled Array. Just as they realized that the Blessed One had gone to the pavilion Jeweled Array via the staircase in this world system of Endurance, they realized that he had also done so in all the world systems of the trichiliocosm.
{{milestone:{label:1.40,id:UT22084-057-006-79}}} At this point, the Blessed One sat down on the lion throne that had been prepared in the pavilion Jeweled Array, encompassed by the trichiliocosm. {{page:{number:10,id:UT22084-057-006-1374,folio:F.146.b}}} The bodhisattvas and the great śrāvakas also took their seats. At this time, the Blessed One attained a buddha absorption called buddha play in unveiled liberation. No sooner had he attained that absorption than as many light rays as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges shone forth from each and every pore of his body. They illuminated all the world systems in the eastern, southern, western, and northern directions. They illuminated the zenith and the nadir, and the intermediate directions as well. 
{{milestone:{label:1.41,id:UT22084-057-006-80}}} As soon as all the world systems had been illuminated in this way, the suffering experienced by sentient beings tormented in the hell realms ceased. The suffering experienced by beings in the world of Yama and the suffering experienced by beings in the animal realm also ceased. In that instant, attachment, aversion, delusion, and all the other afflictive emotions ceased to afflict sentient beings, who all became kind and loving, and considered beings to be like their parents. 
{{milestone:{label:1.42,id:UT22084-057-006-81}}} In order to invite the bodhisattvas through the Buddha’s might, the following verses emanated from the light rays streaming from the Tathāgata:
{{milestone:{label:1.43,id:UT22084-057-006-82}}} “The Buddha sets out thanks to a vast, expansive, and enduring energy.
Through this great energy, he has refrained from turning back throughout the ages.
His qualities are conveyed forcefully in the ten directions. 
The radiance of Śākyamuni is beautiful in illuminating all destinies.
{{milestone:{label:1.44,id:UT22084-057-006-83}}} “Some pay homage at his feet in order to listen to the vast, unsurpassed teachings. {{page:{number:11,id:UT22084-057-006-1375,folio:F.147.a}}}
Those firm in learning and intelligence listen continuously for countless eons.
Those with open minds generate contentment through their aspiration for perfect awakening.
The Capable One radiates light with his wish for sentient beings to be happy.
{{milestone:{label:1.45,id:UT22084-057-006-84}}} “Since the master has energetically conquered hosts of powerful demons and non-Buddhists, 
He is eminent like a lotus in bloom, beautiful like the Merus in the ten directions.
Like the sun, he illuminates all destinies with the radiance of his physical form.
We pray that the Victor comes so that the great meaning in his Dharma wheel may be heard.
{{milestone:{label:1.46,id:UT22084-057-006-85}}} “Out of heartfelt love for beings, he will today, with his ten strengths, turn the sacred wheel, 
Which he has not yet turned, which is unrivaled, and which is turned by all the victors.
Upheld by living beings, today this vast good fortune, so rare for beings to encounter, will arise.
Today may those with pure and vast faith behold what they seek.”
{{milestone:{label:1.47,id:UT22084-057-006-86}}} The light rays transmitted these words to all buddhafields. They invited all bodhisattvas, made all world systems tremble, made all sentient beings happy, and purified all elements of the afflictive emotions. The light rays illuminated Tamondha­kāra and obscured the dwelling places of Māra. They then returned to the immense circle of bodhisattvas and the world system of Endurance, where they disappeared into the top of the Blessed One’s head.
{{milestone:{label:1.48,id:UT22084-057-006-87}}} The light rays first invited the bodhisattva Puṣpaśrī­garbha­sarva­dharma­vaśavartin to come. He resided in a buddhafield situated in the east, called Endowed with the Vast Display of the Precious Merits of Endless Qualities, of the Tathāgata Immaculate Pure Precious Light, Sovereign of the Uninterrupted Luminous Display of Dharma Endowed with the Factors of Awakening. As soon as the light rays reached this bodhisattva, as many bodhisattvas as there are grains of sand in ten Ganges rivers surrounded and followed him in honor. {{page:{number:12,id:UT22084-057-006-1376,folio:F.147.b}}} They all left that buddhafield together and arrived in an instant in this world system of Endurance. Once they had approached the Blessed One inside the pavilion Jeweled Array, they prostrated at his feet. They circumambulated him ten thousand times and in worship showered a multitude of divine gems and beryl upon him. Then they praised him with these words:
{{milestone:{label:1.49,id:UT22084-057-006-88}}} “Blessed One, incomparable and endowed with perfected qualities—
Garlands of praise in honor of your qualities reverberate in all ten directions!
Your qualities are many—a treasury of good qualities.
We come here in pursuit of the Dharma.
{{milestone:{label:1.50,id:UT22084-057-006-89}}} “Just as there is no conceptuality in the sameness of the realm of phenomena,
So the Blessed One knows sameness through his stainless light.
Like a well-trained magician, the Dharma king 
Presents various Dharmas in order to liberate sentient beings.”
{{milestone:{label:1.51,id:UT22084-057-006-90}}} Once those bodhisattvas had praised the Blessed One with countless bodhisattva eulogies, they withdrew to the eastern corner of the pavilion and sat down upon seats created by their own miraculous power. 
{{milestone:{label:1.52,id:UT22084-057-006-91}}} Then the light rays invited the bodhisattva Ratnayaṣṭi to come. He resided in a buddhafield situated in the south, called Buddha Courage, of the Tathāgata Countless Qualities Precious Courage. As the light rays reached him, as many bodhisattvas as there are grains of sand in ten Ganges rivers surrounded and followed him in honor. They all left that buddhafield together and arrived in an instant in this world system of Endurance. Once they had approached the Blessed One inside the pavilion Jeweled Array, they prostrated at his feet. They circumambulated him ten thousand times {{page:{number:13,id:UT22084-057-006-1377,folio:F.148.a}}} and in worship draped the Blessed One with filigrees of gold. Then they praised him with these words:
{{milestone:{label:1.53,id:UT22084-057-006-92}}} “Blessed One, you fill the whole world with clouds of compassion,
You wield the lightning bolts and roar the sounds of ‘empty’ and ‘no self,’
You pacify it with the waters of the eightfold path,
And you bring to maturity a forest grove of virtuous strengths.
{{milestone:{label:1.54,id:UT22084-057-006-93}}} “You dispel the darkness of ignorance with the light of the sugata wisdom,
You awaken sentient beings from their long slumber in the ocean of existence,
You show the path and cause craving to dry up,
And you purify the vision of those dwelling in the city of liberation.” 
{{milestone:{label:1.55,id:UT22084-057-006-94}}} Once the bodhisattvas had praised the Blessed One with countless bodhisattva eulogies, they withdrew to the southern corner of the pavilion and sat down upon seats created by their own miraculous power.
{{milestone:{label:1.56,id:UT22084-057-006-95}}} Then the light rays invited the bodhisattva Sovereign of Powerful Reverberating Sound to come. He resided in a buddhafield situated in the west, called Illuminated, of the Tathāgata Illuminator. As the light rays reached him, as many bodhisattvas as there are grains of sand in ten Ganges rivers surrounded and followed him in honor. They all left that buddhafield together and arrived in an instant in this world system of Endurance. Once they had approached the Blessed One inside the pavilion Jeweled Array, they prostrated at his feet. They circumambulated him ten thousand times and in worship draped the Blessed One with filigrees of pearl necklaces. Then they praised him with these words:
{{milestone:{label:1.57,id:UT22084-057-006-96}}} “Your physical actions resemble the domain of space. 
Your virtuous prayer is endowed with boundless purity.
Since it is stainless, pure, and without defilements, {{page:{number:14,id:UT22084-057-006-1378,folio:F.148.b}}}
It purifies the inconceivable buddhafields of the ten directions.
{{milestone:{label:1.58,id:UT22084-057-006-97}}} “Your speech is steady, illuminating, and coherent.
It appeases the dispositions of beings with uniformity of thought.
Even though there is not the slightest mental movement or conception, 
Victors arise in the minds of sentient beings.”
{{milestone:{label:1.59,id:UT22084-057-006-98}}} Once the bodhisattvas had praised the Blessed One with countless bodhisattva eulogies, they withdrew to the western corner of the pavilion and sat down upon seats created by their own miraculous power.
{{milestone:{label:1.60,id:UT22084-057-006-99}}} Then the light rays invited the bodhisattva Ocean of Supreme Intelligence to come. He resided in a buddhafield situated in the north, called Fully Adorned with Jewels, of the Tathāgata Countless Qualities Precious Courage. As the light rays reached him, as many bodhisattvas as there are grains of sand in ten Ganges rivers surrounded and followed him in honor. They all left that buddhafield together and arrived in an instant in this world system of Endurance. Once they had approached the Blessed One inside the pavilion Jeweled Array, they prostrated at his feet. They circumambulated him ten thousand times and in worship draped the Blessed One with filigrees of crystals and jewels. Then they praised him with these words:
{{milestone:{label:1.61,id:UT22084-057-006-100}}} “Your golden body is like refined gold from the Jambu River.
Possessing the all-seeing eye, it shines throughout the ten directions.
The beings who think of this unique form
Will achieve flawless bliss and joy.
{{milestone:{label:1.62,id:UT22084-057-006-101}}} “Even when one gazes upon the Victor,
The unique knower of the world, as tall as Mount Meru,
Because of the force of all his miraculous powers and the display of his energy
One is unable to see this Victor’s crown protuberance.” {{page:{number:15,id:UT22084-057-006-1379,folio:F.149.a}}}
{{milestone:{label:1.63,id:UT22084-057-006-102}}} Once the bodhisattvas had praised the Blessed One with countless bodhisattva eulogies, they withdrew to the northern corner of the pavilion and sat down upon seats created by their own miraculous power.
{{milestone:{label:1.64,id:UT22084-057-006-103}}} Then the light rays invited the bodhisattva Illuminator to come. He resided in a buddhafield situated in the southeast, called Sorrowless, of the Tathāgata Conqueror of All Sorrow. As the light rays reached him, as many bodhisattvas as there are grains of sand in ten Ganges rivers surrounded and followed him in honor. They all left that buddhafield together and arrived in an instant in this world system of Endurance. Once they had approached the Blessed One inside the pavilion Jeweled Array, they prostrated at his feet. They circumambulated him ten thousand times and in worship draped the Blessed One with filigrees of jewels. Then they praised him with these words:
{{milestone:{label:1.65,id:UT22084-057-006-104}}} “Although each of your bodily hairs contains boundless buddhafields, 
Neither the beings nor the fields themselves are compressed.

Appearing before the Blessed One in the pavilion Jeweled Array, they prostrated themselves at his feet. They offered the Blessed One many hundreds of thousands of divine gifts, and with their palms respectfully and reverently joined they asked the Blessed One, “If we beseech you, Blessed One, ‘Please explain the Dharma! Sugata, please explain the Dharma!’ then, through the blessing of the bodhisattva Māra­pramardaka, we will discard any demonic deeds and henceforth will not perform deeds that confuse sentient beings.

Friends, just as the moon, the sun, or a large precious jewel can dispel all darkness, in the same way, my friends, a single virtuous thought endowed with insight can eliminate all the darkness of unknowing. Friends, that is why, through this root of virtue, you will gradually remove all the darkness of unknowing and attain the great illumination of the Dharma.”
{{milestone:{label:1.115,id:UT22084-057-006-153}}} At this point, the bodhisattva Dharmeśvara­rāja, who was present among the members of the retinue, said, “Blessed One, the buddha domain blessed and revealed by the Tathāgata is inconceivable.

The tathāgatas completely and perfectly awaken by realizing that all those phenomena are in truth emptiness. Theirs is not an awakening brought about by making phenomena empty by means of emptiness. What is called emptiness and what is called awakening are understood to be one and the same. There is no division of emptiness and awakening into two categories at all.
{{milestone:{label:2.217,id:UT22084-057-006-390}}} “Why is that? Phenomena are nondual; they cannot be separated into two. They lack attributes, names, and signs. They are without movement, immovable, and without origination. Empty is a designation for what is devoid of clinging and apprehending. In this regard, ultimately, the phenomena that are referred to as empty are without any objective reference whatsoever, but they are still called empty. Just as we call space space even though space is actually indescribable, we call what is empty empty even though emptiness is actually indescribable. It is like this. This convention of using names to label what is nameless is applied to all phenomena. A name also does not inhere in the object or in a part of it. Just as names do not inhere in objects or in their parts, in the same way, whatever phenomenon described by a given name also does not inhere in the object or in part of it.
{{milestone:{label:2.218,id:UT22084-057-006-391}}} “In that way tathāgatas understand all these phenomena. They understand them to be primordially unborn, unceasing, without attributes, devoid of mind, mental activity, and consciousness, and without letters or sounds. Insofar as they understand them, they are liberated. There is no bondage. There is also no liberation. Great tathāgata compassion extends to beings with the thought, ‘Immature ordinary beings do not comprehend this sameness. They should comprehend it.’ {{page:{number:76,id:UT22084-057-006-1440,folio:F.179.b}}}
{{milestone:{label:2.219,id:UT22084-057-006-392}}}  “Son of noble family, awakening is similar to space. Space itself is never the same, but it is also never not the same. Awakening too is never the same, but it is also never not the same. Since phenomena do not truly exist, one cannot say whether they are the same or not the same. This is what tathāgatas realize when they fully awaken to the fact that all phenomena are not the same and are not not the same. They fully awaken without making even the slightest phenomenon the same or not the same.
{{milestone:{label:2.220,id:UT22084-057-006-393}}} “They understand with correct wisdom exactly what these phenomena are like. What is correct wisdom? It is the understanding that all phenomena are without root, that they are unborn and unceasing. They arise out of the unarisen. Having arisen, they pass away. They arise without a creator, and they pass away without a creator. 
{{milestone:{label:2.221,id:UT22084-057-006-394}}} “In that way, though phenomena come to be through arising and perishing, there is no coming to be whatsoever. It is said that ‘the tathāgatas teach the Dharma in order to cut off the pathways of existence.’ Great tathāgata compassion extends to beings with the thought, ‘Sentient beings do not comprehend how to cut off the pathways of existence. They should comprehend it.’
{{milestone:{label:2.222,id:UT22084-057-006-395}}} “Son of noble family, awakening is a real ground. What is a real ground? As is awakening, so is form, which does not transcend suchness. As is awakening, so are feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, which do not transcend suchness. As is awakening, so are the elements of earth, water, fire, and wind, which do not transcend suchness. As is awakening, so are the elements of eye, {{page:{number:77,id:UT22084-057-006-1441,folio:F.180.a}}} form, and visual consciousness, which do not transcend suchness.

As is awakening, so are the elements of body, tactile sensation, and tactile consciousness, which do not transcend suchness. As is awakening, so are the elements of mind, phenomena, and mental consciousness, which do not transcend suchness. It is just these that are labeled as phenomena.

As these were before, so they are later, and so they are in the meantime. They do not arise in the beginning, they do not pass on in the end, and they are devoid in the meantime. This is a real ground. As one is, so are they all. As they all are, so is one. The tathāgatas do not objectify the way things are in terms of one or many.

In this regard, what are the aspects? What is the absence of aspects? Aspects refers to taking up all virtuous factors. Absence of aspects refers to not objectifying any factor. Aspects refers to the ground of the mind that is groundless. Absence of aspects refers to the gate of liberation, a meditative absorption without signs. {{page:{number:78,id:UT22084-057-006-1442,folio:F.180.b}}}Aspects refers to thinking about, evaluating, enumerating, and discriminating phenomena. Absence of aspects refers to the complete transcendence of evaluation. What is the complete transcendence of evaluation? It is that in which there is no activity of consciousness. Aspects refers to discriminating conditioned things. Absence of aspects refers to realizing the unconditioned. Great tathāgata compassion extends to beings with the thought, ‘Immature ordinary beings do not comprehend penetrating the aspects and the absence of aspects. They should comprehend it.’
{{milestone:{label:2.225,id:UT22084-057-006-398}}} “Son of noble family, awakening is the absence of contamination and the absence of appropriation. In this regard, what is the absence of contamination? What is the absence of appropriation? Absence of contamination means freedom from the four contaminants: freedom from the contaminant of desire, freedom from the contaminant of becoming, freedom from the contaminant of ignorance, and freedom from the contaminant of views. Absence of appropriation refers to freedom from the four appropriations: freedom from the appropriation of desire, freedom from the appropriation of views, freedom from the appropriation of asserting a self, and freedom from the appropriation of belief in the supremacy of one’s morality and asceticism. These four appropriations are darkened by ignorance and approached through craving. Thinking ‘I am,’ they are appropriated through clinging. The tathāgatas understand the I to be the root of appropriation, and they realize that purification of the self is the purification of sentient beings. The purification of the self and the purification of all sentient beings are an inseparable nonduality. Nonduality refers to nonarising. {{page:{number:79,id:UT22084-057-006-1443,folio:F.181.a}}} Due to nonarising and noncessation, mind, mental activity, and consciousness do not operate. Where mind, mental activity, and consciousness do not operate, there is absolutely none of the false imagining of incorrect mental activity.
{{milestone:{label:2.226,id:UT22084-057-006-399}}} “Someone with correct mental activity does not activate ignorance. When ignorance does not arise, the twelve links of becoming do not arise. When the twelve links of becoming do not arise, there is no birth. That which is unborn is certain. That which is certain is the definitive meaning. That which is the definitive meaning is the ultimate. That which is ultimate means the reality devoid of a person. The reality devoid of a person is inexpressible. The inexpressible is dependent arising. Dependent arising is the Dharma. The Dharma is suchness. Suchness is the tathāgata. Therefore, it is said that ‘whoever sees dependent arising sees the Dharma, and whoever sees the Dharma sees the tathāgata.’ When one searches, informed by suchness, one sees nothing whatsoever, and that is how one sees. What is that ‘nothing whatsoever?’ The answer is ‘conceptual signs and objective references.’ At the time when one sees without thought or objective reference, one sees truly. In this manner, tathāgatas completely and perfectly awaken, by means of sameness, to the sameness of all phenomena. Great tathāgata compassion extends to beings with the thought, ‘Sentient beings do not comprehend what is without contamination and appropriation. They should comprehend it.’

What is without afflictive emotions? {{page:{number:80,id:UT22084-057-006-1444,folio:F.181.b}}}Emptiness is pure. Signlessness is stainless. Wishlessness is without afflictive emotions. The unborn is pure. Absence of conditioning is stainless. Nonarising is without afflictive emotions. The nature is pure. Total purity is stainless. Luminosity is without afflictive emotions.

It remains unknowable to the whole world, indescribable by language, and hard for others to achieve. It exists unceasingly in all buddhafields, conforms equally to all buddhas, and completely transcends all efforts. It is nonconceptual since it is equal to space. Since it is the action of the realm of phenomena, it does not act in a differentiated way. Why is that? Son of noble family, the blessed buddhas do not appear in order to deliver differentiated discourses. Nor, indeed, do they appear in order to deliver discourses that differentiate beings, buddhafields, dharmas, intentions, liberations, or types of nirvāṇa. Rather, upon attaining complete and perfect buddhahood, the tathāgatas—who are of one taste with the realm of phenomena, who are unobstructed, {{page:{number:148,id:UT22084-057-006-1511,folio:F.215.b}}} and who provide opportunity to all beings—set in motion the unobstructed wheel of the Dharma—the irreversible wheel of the Dharma—so that beings may comprehend the Dharma.

Next he rinses the gem in a strong quicksilver solution and polishes it with sawdust and woolen cloth. But his efforts do not stop there. Finally he rinses it in a great purifying liquid and polishes it with the finest cotton. Once he has polished it and separated it from the lesser quartz, it may thenceforth be called beryl.

Then, they cause them to enter the Dharma and Vinaya of the noble ones. But the efforts of the tathāgatas do not stop there. Next, they cause beings to comprehend the way of the tathāgatas through discourses on emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. But the efforts of the tathāgatas do not stop there. Finally, they guide beings into the domain of the tathāgatas through discourses known as The Irreversible Wheel of the Dharma and The Purification of the Triple Sphere.

It became embellished with many pearl necklaces arrayed as latticework of dangling jewels, decorated with checkered designs, carefully arranged, adorned with a net of small and large bells, and embellished with lotus flowers made of jewels. From each individual pearl of those necklaces, unfathomably innumerable bodhisattva bodies emerged.

Sixteen years after the Tathāgata Maitreya reaches perfect buddhahood, and while he resides in the pavilion Jeweled Array, when this Dharma discourse of the Great Assembly chapter from The Gateway to Unobstructed Deliverance through the Bodhisattva Way of Life is taught in detail, and a congregation of bodhisattvas endowed with teachings and all qualities assembles, who will delight in making these offerings to the Tathāgata Maitreya as well as to all the tathāgatas of this Good Eon?”

He supplicated the Blessed One and said, “Blessed One, I will delight in offering this array of ornaments, which is not constructed, is not disorderly, does not grow old, and does not deteriorate, to the Tathāgata Maitreya, as well as to all those other tathāgata, arhat, completely and perfectly awakened buddhas of the Good Eon who are not present here.”

{{milestone:{label:2.519,id:UT22084-057-006-707}}} The bodhisattva replied, “Son of noble family, every receptacle is fragile and liable to break.

My friend, look at my body without closing your eyes, and you will see a great receptacle.”
{{milestone:{label:2.520,id:UT22084-057-006-708}}} Magical Display of Māra gazed at the body of the bodhisattva with his eyes wide open. He saw a world sphere called Appearance of the Sovereign of Water in the maṇḍala at the navel center of the bodhisattva’s body and asked, “Why is that world sphere called Appearance as the Sovereign of Water?”
{{milestone:{label:2.521,id:UT22084-057-006-709}}} “Because it is full of water. It looks just like an ocean. In that sphere lives a tathāgata known as Glory of Precious Blue Lotus.

Now that I have heard this discourse and witnessed the miraculous power of the bodhisattva called Magical Display of All Phenomena, I will generate with determination the mind of unsurpassed, complete and perfect awakening. Blessed One, even beings who burn in hell for as many eons as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges will eventually awaken to unsurpassed, complete and perfect awakening. Therefore, I will never give up such unsurpassed, complete and perfect awakening!”
{{milestone:{label:2.524,id:UT22084-057-006-712}}} The Blessed One replied, “Excellent! It is excellent that you, O noble being, now wear the armor of unsurpassed, complete and perfect awakening and possess the blessing of miraculous power.”
{{milestone:{label:2.525,id:UT22084-057-006-713}}} At that point a bodhisattva called Siṃhaketu, who was also present in the assembled retinue, said to Dhāraṇīśvara­rāja, “Son of noble family, when bodhisattvas are established in dhāraṇīs, they retain all that the buddhas say, and when they teach the Dharma it becomes inexhaustible. Explaining it carefully, they satisfy all beings. What are the bodhisattva dhāraṇīs?”

After one has gained certainty due to the blessings of the Dharma teaching, as one teaches the Dharma the melody of the Dharma generates understanding in a single buddhafield. The melody generates understanding in two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or one hundred buddhafields. It generates understanding in one thousand buddhafields, in ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or up to one hundred thousand buddhafields. Its melody creates understanding in billions of buddhafields. It magically creates a lion throne that reaches as high as one krośa. One sits down on it and teaches the Dharma. Likewise, in order to satisfy the interests of devoted beings, one magically creates a lion throne that reaches as high as half a yojana, a full yojana, Mount Meru, or the Brahmā realm. One sits down on it and teaches the Dharma. 
{{milestone:{label:2.531,id:UT22084-057-006-720}}} “While seated on the lion throne, all the buddhas of the ten directions appear. One hears all the dharmas that the blessed buddhas explain. Having heard them, one retains all of them through the power of dhāraṇī and does not forget them. Such dharmas cause one to experience the meaning of each of the dharmas. Listening to other dharmas does not prevent one from teaching the Dharma. Teaching the Dharma does not prevent one from listening to the Dharma. By engaging in the sound of a single syllable, one engages in the sounds of all syllables. Thus, by uttering the first letter a, infinite doors to the Dharma are expressed.

In that world grew fruit trees of the seven precious substances with jeweled branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits.

In this buddhafield, those who dwelled in multistoried houses located on the ground were considered ‘human’ beings, while those who dwelled in multistoried houses located in the sky were considered ‘divine’ beings.
