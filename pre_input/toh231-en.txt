{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-30}} Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing at Gayā­śīrṣa Hill in the Gayā region together with a great saṅgha of seventy-two thousand monks. All of them were worthy ones who had brought the defilements to exhaustion. They were free from affliction and composed. Their minds were fully liberated. Their insight was fully liberated. They were beings of noble birth, great elephants, who had accomplished their tasks and completed their work. They had laid down their burden and fulfilled their objectives. With all their bonds to existence exhausted, they had reached the utter liberation of the mind by means of genuine knowledge. {{note:{index:21,id:UT22084-064-001-31}}} They had reached the final culmination of complete mastery over mind {{page:{number:2,folio:F.2.a}}} and were experts with respect to the realm of phenomena. They were children of the King of Dharma. Completely disinterested in acquisitions and praise, they were true renunciants, who had completed their ordination and perfected their pursuits. Thus, they all remained upon the path to nirvāṇa {{note:{index:22,id:UT22084-064-001-32}}} —all except for one: the venerable Ā­nanda.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-33}} The Blessed One was also accompanied by a great gathering of eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas, all of whom were obstructed by only a single birth. They were all turned toward omniscience, pursuing omniscience, approaching omniscience, and reaching omniscience. They had all attained unimpeded retention and absorption, entered the absorption of the heroic gait, and were reveling in magnificent forms of superknowledge. Their path was uninterrupted, and they were entirely free of obscurations, hindrances, or disturbances. They spread their great love and compassion throughout all the worlds of the ten directions, and they were experts in traveling to infinite buddha realms. They experienced emptiness, remained within the absence of marks, and were free from any fixation on wishes. They pursued the welfare of all beings and were experts with respect to the entire domain of the buddhas. Their wisdom was boundless, their minds were vast like the sky, deep as the sea, and unshakable like Sumeru, the king of mountains. {{page:{number:3,folio:F.2.b}}} Like lotuses, their minds were unstained; like jewels, their minds were pure; like gold, their minds were refined. {{note:{index:23,id:UT22084-064-001-34}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-35}} Among them were the bodhisattva great beings {{note:{index:24,id:UT22084-064-001-36}}} Ratna­ketu, {{note:{index:25,id:UT22084-064-001-37}}} Ratna­pāṇi, {{note:{index:26,id:UT22084-064-001-38}}} Ratna­mudrā­hasta, Ratna­mu­kuṭa, Ratna­cūḍa, Ratna­kūṭa, Ratnā­kara, Ratna­śikhara, Ratna­dhvaja, Vajragarbha, Su­varṇa­garbha, Ratna­garbha, Śrī­garbha, Śubha­garbha, Śubha­vi­mala­garbha, Tathāgata­garbha, Jñāna­garbha, Sūrya­garbha, Samādhi­garbha, Padma­garbha, Vi­mukti­candra, {{note:{index:27,id:UT22084-064-001-39}}} Sa­manta­candra, Avalo­kiteś­vara, {{note:{index:28,id:UT22084-064-001-40}}} Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, Sa­manta­bhadra, Sa­manta­netra, Padma­netra, Vi­mala­netra, Vi­śāla­netra, Sa­manterya­patha, Sa­manta­prāsā­dika, Sa­manta­cāri­tra­mati, Jñāna­mati, Dharma­mati, Jaya­mati, Uttara­mati, Vajra­mati, Vi­śeṣa­mati, Siṁha­vi­krī­ḍita, Mahā­ghoṣa­svara­rāja, Siṁha­nāda­nādin, Gambhī­raghoṣa­svaranā­dita, {{note:{index:29,id:UT22084-064-001-41}}} A­nupa­lipta, Sarva­malā­pa­gata, Candra­prabha, Sūrya­prabha, Jñāna­prabha, Jñāna­śrī, Bhadraśrī, Candra­śrī, Padma­śrī, Ratna­śrī, Mañju­śrī­kumāra­bhūta, Bhadra­pāla and the others among the sixteen holy beings, as well as Maitreya and all the other bodhisattva great beings of the excellent eon.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-42}} Present there were also the four great kings and the others gods of the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, as well as Śakra, king of the gods, {{page:{number:4,folio:F.3.a}}} along with the other gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. Present there were the gods of the Heaven Free from Strife, {{note:{index:30,id:UT22084-064-001-43}}} such as Su­yāma; {{note:{index:31,id:UT22084-064-001-44}}} the gods of the Heaven of Joy, such as Saṃ­tuṣita; {{note:{index:32,id:UT22084-064-001-45}}} the gods of the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, such as Su­nirmi­ta; and the gods of the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations, such as Vaśa­vartin. {{note:{index:33,id:UT22084-064-001-46}}} Present were Sārtha­vāha and other such māras of the side of virtue, Mahā­brahmā and all the gods of the Realm of Brahmā, and Mahe­śvara accompanied by all the gods of the pure abodes. Present were Vema­citra, Balin, and Dhan­ada, rulers of the demigods, along with many hundreds of thousands of demigods. Present also were the nāga kings A­nava­tapta, Manasvin, Sā­gara, A­nanta, and Vāsuki, along with many hundreds of thousands of other kings of the nāgas; many hundreds of thousands of nāga princes, such as Śrī­tejas; and numerous nāga ladies. Present also were hundreds of thousands of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas. At the time, the area surrounding Gayā­śīrṣa Hill in the Gayā region was filled to the brim with gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans. These beings filled the land and the sky to a radius of four leagues, so that not even a particle the size of a fraction of the tip of a hair could be inserted anywhere.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-47}} At the center of this assembly was the lion throne of the Blessed One. One league tall and half a league wide, the throne was cushioned with numerous divine fabrics, canopied with webs of jewel bells, draped with hundreds of thousands of brocade tassels, and adorned with scattered flowers. The vajra surface of the ground where the throne stood was delightful and smooth, like the palm of a hand. {{page:{number:5,folio:F.3.b}}} Well sprinkled and well swept, the ground was fragrant and covered with a scattering of many hundreds of thousands of divine flowers. For the sake of the Blessed One’s enjoyment, the area had golden lotus flowers, each the size of a chariot wheel {{note:{index:34,id:UT22084-064-001-48}}} and with many hundred thousand petals. These lotuses grew from stems of beryl, had cores of sapphire, and their anthers were of emerald. They had a captivating scent, were of perfect beauty, and were delightful to the touch. Not too far yet not too close to each of the throne’s four corners stood a jewel tree. Each of the trees had grown to a height of two and a half leagues with a trunk that reached a width of two krośas.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-49}} Seated upon this well-arranged throne was the Blessed One. With perfectly pure wisdom, he was turning the wheel of Dharma. Conquering all māras and opponents, he remained unblemished by any mundane qualities. He was fearless and indomitable, like a dauntless lion. He was clear like a lake, immaculate and lucid. Resembling the ocean, he was deep and hard to fathom, a source of jewels. He was truly elevated like the king of mountains, sparkling like the sun, and delightful like the moon. Like a great nāga, he let the rain of Dharma fall. Like Mahā­brahmā, he was the whole world’s superior. The master of an infinite circle of extremely adept disciples, he was the center of attention for the entire great assembly that contained Śakra, Brahmā, and one hundred sextillion guardians of the world.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-50}} Within this gathering the Blessed One was magnificent, brilliant, and resplendent. From the magnificent, brilliant, and resplendent uṣṇīṣa upon his head shone forth millions of circles of light, forming what is known as the light of universal illumination . As this light shone forth, all the worlds in the ten directions were illuminated. The light then returned and circled around the Blessed One three times before it entered his mouth. {{page:{number:6,folio:F.4.a}}} At that point, it could not be seen whether the Blessed One’s mouth was open or closed. Similarly, the light of the sun or the moon may enter the expanse of space, and yet the expanse of space cannot be seen to be either open or closed. In the same way, these light rays entered the mouth of the Blessed One, and yet his mouth could not be seen to be either open or closed. Moreover, when melted butter, or oil, or water is poured onto a mound of sand, it cannot be said whether the mound is open or closed. Similarly, although the light rays entered the Blessed One’s mouth, his mouth could not be seen to be either open or closed.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-51}} Now, to the east of this buddha realm, beyond as many worlds as there are grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, there is a world known as Realm of Lotuses. Therein resides the one known as Padma­netra. He is a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha, someone with proper knowledge and conduct, a blissful one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassed leader of those to be trained, a teacher of gods and humans. That blessed buddha teaches the Dharma to bodhisattva great beings in terms of a single vehicle. Thus, in that buddha realm even the words “listener” or “solitary buddha” are unheard of, as are the names of their respective vehicles. Everyone in that buddha realm takes birth instantaneously, such that birth from the wombs of females is unheard of. All the sentient beings of that realm are, without exception, bodhisattvas whose progress toward unexcelled and complete awakening is irreversible. In that realm food, drink, and their consumption are all unknown. All the bodhisattvas of that realm partake of the delightful sustenance of concentration, the delightful sustenance of absorption, and the delightful sustenance of the Dharma. The light that shines from that thus-gone one pervades that realm and illuminates it. Apart from that, that world knows of no moonlight or sunlight, {{page:{number:7,folio:F.4.b}}} nor of any light from planets or stars. The land there is perfectly even, like the palm of a hand, and there are no grasses, trees, rocks, walls, or mountains.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-52}} In that realm there was a bodhisattva great being known as Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin, who had the power to exhaust all the obscurations of whoever merely heard his name. The light of the Thus-Gone One touched and inspired Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin, and so he left his own abode and journeyed to the place where Buddha Padma­netra was residing. He bowed his head down to the feet of the Blessed One and took his seat before Padma­netra. Similarly, other bodhisattvas were touched and inspired by the light, so they also left their respective residences and went to see the blessed thus-gone Padma­netra. They bowed their heads to his feet and took their place before him.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-53}} At that time the bodhisattva great being Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt with his right knee in the center of a lotus flower. Joining his palms, he bowed toward the blessed thus-gone Padma­netra. “Blessed One,” he asked, “by whose power is it that this excellent light emerges, which is so bright, immaculate, delightful, and utterly gratifying for the body and mind?”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-54}} The blessed thus-gone Padma­netra replied, “Noble son, in the west, beyond as many worlds as there are grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, there is a world known as Endurance. Therein resides the one known as Śākyamuni. He is a thus-gone, worthy, {{page:{number:8,folio:F.5.a}}} perfect buddha, someone with proper knowledge and conduct, a blissful one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassed leader of those to be trained, a teacher of gods and humans. Whoever merely hears this blessed buddha’s name will make progress toward unexcelled and complete awakening that is irreversible. It is he who sends forth this excellent light that is bright, immaculate, delightful, and utterly gratifying for the body and the mind.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-55}} Further addressing the blessed thus-gone Padma­netra, the bodhisattva great being Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin then asked, “Blessed One, what is the cause and what is the condition that make it so that whoever hears the name of that thus-gone one will make irreversible progress toward unexcelled and complete awakening?”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-56}} To the bodhisattva great being Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin the blessed thus-gone Padma­netra replied, “Noble son, when that thus-gone one was still pursuing the practices of a bodhisattva, he would pray, ‘Whenever someone hears the name under which I shall gain perfect buddhahood, may that being thereby make irreversible progress toward unexcelled and complete awakening!’ ”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-57}} The bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin then inquired, “Blessed One, have all sentient beings of that realm attained the state of irreversible progress?”
“No,” replied the Blessed One, “they have not.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-59}} Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin asked, “Blessed One, is it because they have not heard the name of that thus-gone one?”
“Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “they have indeed heard that thus-gone one’s name.” {{page:{number:9,folio:F.5.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-61}} “In that case, why have they not yet attained the level of irreversible progress?”
“Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “the progress beings there make is irreversible, yet it is also reversible.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-63}} “How, Blessed One, can it be both irreversible as well as reversible?”
“Noble son, I perceive that once they have heard the name of that thus-gone one the seed of irreversible progess is present within them. Thus, they are definitively destined to make irreversible progress. Yet their progress does not, because of that alone, immediately become irreversible. Noble son, to demonstrate this point I shall give you an analogy. Noble son, think of the seeds of a tree. If those seeds are flawless, and if all the conditions for growth, from sprouting through to completion, are present, then what would you call such seeds?”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-65}} “Blessed One, because they are entirely flawless, I would then call them ‘perfect.’ ”
“Noble son, similarly, once they have heard the name of that thus-gone one, those sentient beings possess the seed of irreversible progress. And in that sense their progress to unexcelled and complete awakening has become irreversible.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-67}} The bodhisattva great being Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin then said to the blessed thus-gone Padma­netra, “Blessed One, I would like to go to that world called Endurance so that I can prostrate before the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Śākyamuni. I wish to venerate, honor, and revere him. I wish to praise him and offer him worship.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-68}} In reply, the blessed thus-gone Padma­netra said to the bodhisattva great being Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin, {{page:{number:10,folio:F.6.a}}} “Noble son, if you know that the time has come, you may leave.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-976}} At that point all the bodhisattvas addressed the blessed thus-gone Padma­netra: “Blessed One, we also wish to see that world called Endurance. We also wish to prostrate before the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Śākyamuni. We also wish to venerate, honor, and revere him. We also wish to praise him and offer him worship.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-70}} In reply, the blessed thus-gone Padma­netra said to them, “Children of noble family, if you know that the time has come, you may leave. But once you are in that realm, be careful. Why? Because among the beings of that realm desire, anger, and dullness are rife. They have no regard for mendicants and no regard for brahmins. They have no concern for their fathers, no concern for their mothers. Numerous are their wishes that run counter to the Dharma. They are spiteful, savage, and malicious. They are impudent and haughty, easily carried away, and full of craving. They are lazy, unkind, and evil. They are tied down by envy and miserliness and suffer from an abundance of afflictions. It is among such beings that that thus-gone one teaches the Dharma.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-71}} “Blessed One,” replied the bodhisattvas, “teaching the Dharma among such sentient beings is a tremendous feat displayed by that thus-gone one.”
“Yes, it is,” the Blessed One agreed. “Noble children, teaching the Dharma among such sentient beings is indeed a tremendous feat displayed by that thus-gone one. Moreover, noble children, {{page:{number:11,folio:F.6.b}}} when sentient beings within such a world of rampant afflictions give rise to just a single virtuous mind state then they also display a tremendous feat. Why? Well, what would be amazing about finding pure beings in pure worlds? On the other hand, it is indeed a wonder when anyone in a world of rampant afflictions is able, ever so briefly, to engender faith, or go for refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, or purely observe discipline. However, it is an even greater wonder if, even for just a moment, they can attain a mind free from desire. Still, the greatest wonder of all is if they can briefly develop compassion and give rise to the mind of unexcelled and complete awakening.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-73}} “The Blessed One is amazing!” the bodhisattvas responded. “The Thus-Gone One is amazing!”
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin and the other bodhisattvas then said, “Excellent, Blessed One.” And so, having bowed their heads to the feet of the buddha who had instructed them in this way, each of them rose from the place where they had been sitting.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-75}} In order to bring offerings to the blessed Śākyamuni, some of the bodhisattvas emanated forth jewel trees, complete with flowers and fruits, and perfect in their height and circumference. Some brought forth trees of beryl, some trees of crystal; some brought forth wish-fulfilling trees, and others brought forth trees of gold. Some produced trees in bloom; some brought forth trees bearing fruit. Some emanated a cloud of precious fabric, some a cloud of ornaments, some a cloud of incense, {{page:{number:12,folio:F.7.a}}} some a cloud of garlands, some a cloud of powders, some a cloud of parasols, some a cloud of banners, and some a cloud of cymbals. Having brought together all these emanated offerings, the bodhisattvas then gathered and traveled along with Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin to the world called Endurance.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-76}} Once there, the bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin exclaimed, “Friends, alas, the sentient beings of this world called Endurance are suffering! Therefore, let us bring forth a magical display that delivers the highest bliss to all these sentient beings!”
“So be it!” replied all the bodhisattvas, and so they followed the bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin’s suggestion.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-78}} Hence, as a magical manifestation, there appeared a brilliant light from the body of the bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin. Bright, immaculate, and delightful, the light was utterly gratifying to the body and mind as it pervaded and illumined the entire trichiliocosm. As this light touched them, all the sentient beings within that trichiliocosm who had the body of a being in hell, or who had a body belonging to the animal realm, or a body belonging to the realm of the Lord of Death were freed from their feelings of pain, and instead they found happiness. They were also freed from anger and ill will, and they began to regard one another as they would their parents.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-79}} Within that trichiliocosm all the dense darkness that exists between the worlds—that which cannot be brightened, illumined, or lit up by the sun or the moon, which are otherwise so famed for their miraculous power and force—was now also permeated by that light so that all the beings who lived there could see one another. {{page:{number:13,folio:F.7.b}}} Within that trichiliocosm all the surrounding mountain ranges, great mountain ranges, Mucilinda Mountains, and Mahā­muci­linda Mountains, along with all the other dark mountains, were now also pervaded and illumined by the light. From the Realm of Brahmā above, down to the realm of the beings in the Hell of Incessant Pain below, there was not a single spot that was not perfectly illumined by that great light—such was extent of Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin’s miraculous display.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-80}} Each of the other bodhisattvas also brought forth magical emanations. Hence, every sentient being wishing for food received sustenance, and whoever wished for drink received refreshment. Those desiring clothes received clothing, those wanting a mount received one, and those wishing for wealth found riches. The blind gained their sight and the deaf could hear. The naked received fine garments, the insane regained their senses, those in pain became well, and those in labor gave birth easily. Such were the effects of their miraculous activities.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-81}} The bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin and all the other bodhisattvas then proceeded to Gayā and Gayā­śīrṣa Hill. As soon these holy beings were approaching, a net of jewels appeared, bedecking the entire trichiliocosm, and a rain of divine lotus flowers fell from the sky. Rain fell from clouds of divine flowers, clouds of divine fruits, clouds of divine garlands, clouds of divine incense, clouds of divine garments, clouds of divine powders, and clouds of divine Dharma robes, divine umbrellas, divine banners, and divine standards. {{page:{number:14,folio:F.8.a}}} As this divine rain was falling, all the beings who were touched by it felt blissful. All the ordinary trees and soil of the region of Gayā and Gayā­śīrṣa now disappeared, and instead the land was filled with trees of jewels, wish-fulfilling trees, flowering trees, fruit-bearing trees, sandalwood trees, and aloeswood trees, and the land was in all regards excellent. From the sky divine instruments were heard, and as they played they produced these verses:
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-82}} “Born at the perfect site, the garden of Lumbinī, He has no equal, not being subject to any affliction— Here we have arrived at this most excellent mountain To worship the one who is equal to space.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-83}} “At the tree of awakening he gained perfect awakening, Crushed the power of the māras, and became a buddha— Here we have arrived at this most excellent mountain To worship the one who is stainless and splendid.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-84}} “All phenomena he realizes To be like an illusion, a visual distortion, and a reflection of the moon in water— Here we have arrived at this most excellent mountain To worship this finest field of merit.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-85}} “All the different phenomena he realizes To be like rainbows, or a dancer’s mask— Here we have arrived at this most excellent mountain To worship the treasure of immutable merit.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-86}} “Throughout many hundreds of eons he has perfected The accumulations by means of his compassionate mind— Here we have arrived at this most excellent mountain To worship the one whose face is like a stainless moon.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-87}} “Venerated he is by billions of bodhisattvas As well as by the hosts of the gods— Here we have arrived at this most excellent mountain To worship the one who is free from the darkness of unknowing.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-88}} “Having discovered the treasure of sublime Dharma, Out of compassion he distributes it in the world— Here we have arrived at this most excellent mountain {{page:{number:15,folio:F.8.b}}} To worship the one who benefits beyond compare.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-89}} “With his peaceful mind of constant love, He is unstained by afflictions, like a lotus unstained by the water— Here we have arrived at this most excellent mountain To worship the one who masters supreme qualities.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-90}} “His pure body, adorned with the blossoms of perfect marks, Sustains wandering beings with the grains of excellent signs— Carrying offerings, here together we have arrived To worship this jewel tree that bears infinite branches.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-91}} As soon as these verses were heard, the venerable Mahā­maud­galyā­yana rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and said, “Blessed One, we are witnessing many unprecedented sounds and sights. Whose signs are all these?”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-92}} The Blessed One replied to the venerable Mahā­maud­galyā­yana, “Maud­galyā­yana, to the east, beyond as many worlds as there are grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, there is a world known as Realm of Lotuses. There at present resides the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Padma­netra. Residing and flourishing in that realm, he also teaches the Dharma. Now the bodhisattva great being Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin has come to this world called Endurance from the buddha realm of that thus-gone one. This holy being is arriving here accompanied by one hundred sextillion other bodhisattvas, and what you perceive are the signs of their arrival.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-93}} As soon as the Blessed One had spoken, the bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin, surrounded and venerated by a retinue of one hundred sextillion bodhisattvas, {{page:{number:16,folio:F.9.a}}} arrived before the Blessed One through his great miraculous power and the great power of the bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas bowed to the Blessed One’s feet, sat down before him, and Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin then spoke the following verses in praise of the Blessed One’s qualities:
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-94}} “Greatly famed and of great insight, You are the great capable one, the great hero, The one who has gone beyond the pains of existence. You who have gone beyond the afflictions—homage to you!
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-95}} “Open and direct in all regards, You reside so perfectly pristine, Completely liberated in every way— Homage to you who are incomparable and unequaled!
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-96}} “Utterly immutable, you resemble a mountain; Deep and wide, you are like the sea. Unshakable in the face of the non-Buddhists, You are the King of Dharma—homage to you!
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-97}} “Turning the wheel of Dharma, You teach primordial peace and non-arising, The natural transcendence of suffering— Protector, such are the qualities that you reveal.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-98}} “Some you teach the path, Others you establish within the real; Some you deliver beyond suffering, And for others you prophesy awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-99}} “Knowing all latencies and inclinations, There is nothing you are not aware of. Thus, as you perceive the ways of training, Your command will be carried out.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-100}} “When you sat upon the seat of awakening, Desire, anger, and dullness, Along with every other stain, Were consumed by the fire of your wisdom.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-101}} “Yourself beyond, you liberate sentient beings, And while free yourself, you liberate beings. You are the one who cares for the world As it roams through the realms of pain.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-102}} “Sentient beings within the prison of existence Have for long been asleep in their ignorance. Yet you, Protector, awaken them. Homage to you, the friend of beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-103}} “All these supreme children of yours Have set out in pursuit of awakening. As they wish to the hear the sacred Dharma, I request, O Guide, that you teach them.” {{page:{number:17,folio:F.9.b}}}

Likewise, with the Blessed One’s permission the other bodhisattvas each took a seat on their own lotus flower.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-105}} The bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin now rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt with his right knee on the lotus flower. Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and said, “If the Blessed One would grant me the opportunity to ask them and hear his answers, I have a few questions that I would like to bring before the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-106}} Replying to the bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin, the Blessed One said, “Holy being, all thus-gone ones will always grant you the opportunity to speak. You may ask the Thus-Gone One whatever you wish. I shall then satisfy your mind with a teaching.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-107}} With the Blessed One’s permission, the bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin then asked, “Blessed One, what are the bodhisattva great beings’ perfections of generosity like? How are their perfections of discipline? How are their perfections of patience? How are their perfections of diligence? How are their perfections of concentration?

{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-114}} In reply to the bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin, the Blessed One said, “Noble son, excellent, excellent. Noble son, you have asked in this manner to benefit many beings and to bring them happiness. You have great compassion that loves the world and seeks to benefit ordinary beings—gods and humans alike—by accomplishing their welfare and happiness. Your intention for having asked the Thus-Gone One such questions is excellent. Therefore, noble son, I will answer you, so listen well and keep what I say in mind.”
“Excellent, Blessed One!” replied the bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin, and he listened as instructed.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-116}} The Blessed One then said, “Noble son, bodhisattvas who practice perfect generosity possess ten qualities. What are those ten? They are the perfect giving of the Dharma, the perfect giving of fearlessness, the perfect giving of material things, the perfect giving free of expectation of a reward, the perfect giving of compassion, the perfect giving free of disdain, the perfect giving of respect, the perfect giving of reverence and worship, the perfect open-ended giving, and the perfectly pure giving.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-117}} “Noble son, you may wonder what the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving of the Dharma consists in. Noble son, it consists in the bodhisattvas’ making others retain and understand the teachings without any concern for material things. This is not done for the sake of wealth or respect, or with a wish for mundane gain, or with a wish for fame. Rather, they think, ‘How can I bring an end to all the sufferings of these beings?’ In this way, without any concern for material things, they explain the teachings to others in a way that is genuine and beyond duality. {{page:{number:22,folio:F.12.a}}} Just as they teach kings and great ministers thoroughly, so also do they genuinely teach outcasts and their offspring. Needless to mention that they also do so for the inhabitants of foreign cities and lands. Through this giving of the Dharma they do not become arrogant. {{note:{index:36,id:UT22084-064-001-118}}} Noble son, such is the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving of the Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-119}} “Next, what is the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving of fearlessness? Noble son, bodhisattvas personally give up sticks and weapons, and instruct others in that practice. They consider all beings to be like their fathers, mothers, children, friends, relatives, or kinsmen. How so? They recollect that the Thus-Gone One has taught, ‘Among all sentient beings there is no one who, throughout all your changing lives, has not at some point been your father, mother, child, friend, relative, or kinsman.’ With that in mind they feel that they ought to provide for even subtle forms of life by means of their own flesh, and so it goes without saying that they must also act in the same way toward larger creatures. Such is the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving of fearlessness.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-120}} “What is the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving of material things? Noble son, when bodhisattvas see sentient beings engaged in unvirtuous activity they attract them with material things. By thus attracting them with material things, they deliver those beings out of their unvirtuous ways and establish them in goodness. They think to themselves, ‘The Blessed One has taught, “Generosity is the bodhisattva’s awakening. {{note:{index:37,id:UT22084-064-001-121}}} A bodhisattva’s generosity is free of the three unvirtuous qualities of envy, stinginess, and malice.” Therefore, I too {{page:{number:23,folio:F.12.b}}} shall follow the Thus-Gone One and practice generosity.’ Then, as they engage in generous practices, their generosity does not make them conceited. Such is the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving of material things.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-122}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving free of expectation of a reward consist in? The bodhisattvas’ practice of generosity is not based on desire. They do not hope to benefit from it. Their practice of generosity has no objective and is not seeking services. It is not practiced out of worldly concerns. Rather, they think, ‘Bodhisattvas are generous, that is just how it is,’ and so they are generous without any hope that the causes, conditions, or bases of their generosity will bring any reward. Such is the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving free of expectation of a reward.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-123}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving of compassion consist in? When bodhisattvas witness sentient beings who suffer, who are starving, who are thirsting, who go naked, who wear poor garments, whose clothing is poor, whom nobody protects, who have no guardian, who have no savior, who are homeless, and who lack support, then the sight of those beings who lack merit provokes in them a strong feeling of compassion. Thus, they think to themselves, ‘It is for the sake of others that I give rise to the mind of unexcelled and complete awakening. And these are indeed beings who suffer, who are unprotected, who have no guardian, and who have no savior, no strength, and no support. May I at some point be the protector, guardian, savior, strength, and support for all these wandering beings!’ Thus, out of unbearable compassion they benefit those sentient beings with all that they possess and all that they have. Yet they do not become conceited based on the roots of virtue that this creates. Such is the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving of compassion. {{page:{number:24,folio:F.13.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-124}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving free of disdain consist in? When bodhisattvas practice generosity they do not give refuse. They do not give with disdain. They do not give while scolding and not while upset. They do not give with the arrogance and haughtiness of the wealthy. Their generosity is not motivated by a wish for fame. They do not give with the arrogance and haughtiness of the learned. Whatever they give, they give with respect. They give it with decency. They offer it with veneration, and with their own hands. Such is the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving free of disdain.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-125}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving of respect consist in? When bodhisattvas meet a master, a preceptor, a guru, or a fellow student, they acknowledge such individuals with respect and veneration in body and mind. With reverence and veneration they speak respectfully, pay homage, welcome them, join their palms, and bow to them. Thus they will assist those individuals with whichever virtuous deeds they may be engaged in. Such is the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving of respect.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-126}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving of reverence and worship consist in? Bodhisattvas serve the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha. How do they serve the Buddha? At shrines devoted to the thus-gone ones or representations of the bodies of the thus-gone ones the bodhisattvas offer incense, flowers, frankincense, perfumes, or plaster, {{note:{index:38,id:UT22084-064-001-127}}} and they restore shrines that have crumbled. Thus they act in the service of the Buddha. How, then, do they serve the Dharma? They listen to the Dharma, read the Dharma, retain the Dharma, {{page:{number:25,folio:F.13.b}}} write it down, recite it, and practice it to perfection. They keep it in mind. They gain familiarity with it through the unswerving practice of meditation. Thus they act in the service of the Dharma. How, then, do they serve the Saṅgha? To the Saṅgha they offer robes, meals, bedding, medicine for healing the sick, and other provisions—even such small things as a cup of cold water. Thus they act in the service of the Saṅgha. Such is the bodhisattvas’ perfect giving of reverence and worship.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-128}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ perfect open-ended giving consist in? When bodhisattvas are generous, they do not wish, ‘By this generosity, may I become such and such a god!’ or ‘May I became such and such a ruler!’ Such is the bodhisattvas’ perfect open-ended giving.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-129}} “Noble son, you may also wonder about the bodhisattvas’ perfectly pure giving. Noble son, bodhisattvas distinguish the various forms of generosity that were just explained, and they discern all the various things that they give. Because of their discernment, their generosity is free of flaws, stains, or obstacles. Such is the bodhisattvas’ perfectly pure giving. Noble son, bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities practice excellent generosity.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-130}} “Noble son, bodhisattvas who practice excellent discipline possess ten qualities. What are those ten? They are the commitment to the vows of individual liberation, the commitment to the vows of the bodhisattva training, freedom from the pains of the afflictions, freedom from incorrect mental engagements, fear of karma, {{page:{number:26,folio:F.14.a}}} fear of evil, consideration of danger, steadfast commitment, open-ended discipline, and discipline that is purified of the three spheres.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-131}} “Noble son, you may wonder what their commitment to the vows of individual liberation consists in. Noble son, with respect to the Thus-Gone One’s discourses, discipline, or any other point of training, they recollect, ‘These are our teacher’s teachings,’ and so they apply themselves to them in a most excellent way. They do not respect the teachings merely because of any desires associated with family, views, or retinue. Rather, they respect all the points of training because they are means for overcoming personal flaws. Such is the bodhisattvas’ commitment to the vows of individual liberation.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-132}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ commitment to the vows of the bodhisattva training consist in? Bodhisattvas recognize that through the vows of individual liberation alone they will not be able to fully awaken to unexcelled and complete buddhahood. Thus they understand, ‘I must practice all the various bodhisattva practices and all the bodhisattva trainings as they appear in the discourses of the Thus-Gone One.’ {{note:{index:39,id:UT22084-064-001-133}}} What, then, are the genuine bodhisattva practices and what are the aspects of a bodhisattva’s training? Bodhisattvas will not do anything that does not become a source of faith for sentient beings. They will not do anything that is untimely or involves an improper object. Neither will they say anything at the wrong time. They are not unaware of the right time. They do not lack knowledge of the appropriate objects, nor do they fail to know the right measure. They protect sentient beings. In order to complete the accumulations for their awakening they engage in excellent conduct. {{page:{number:27,folio:F.14.b}}} They speak softly and gently, avoid society, and turn toward complete seclusion with a bright smile on their faces. {{note:{index:40,id:UT22084-064-001-134}}} Such is the bodhisattvas’ excellent behavior.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-135}} “What, you may then wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ commitment to the vows of the bodhisattva training further consist in? Keeping all the different discourses taught by the Thus-Gone One as their reference points, bodhisattvas respect and pursue all the points of training and all the prescriptions. Such is the bodhisattvas’ commitment to the vows of bodhisattva training.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-136}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ freedom from the pains of the afflictions consist in? Bodhisattvas do not suffer from the pains of desire, the pains of anger, the pains of dullness, the pains of any affliction, or the pains of lacking material means. They apply the remedy for desire and abandon the conditions for desire. What, then, is the remedy for desire and what is the condition for desire to arise? Contemplating repulsiveness serves as the remedy for desire that is caused by the appearance of a beautiful woman. And what, you may wonder, is the contemplation of repulsiveness? The contemplation of repulsiveness involves considering a person’s hair, body hair, nails, teeth, sweat, secretions, skin, flesh, bone, muscles, veins, kidney, heart, liver, lungs, intestines, colon, stomach, entrails, innards, bladder, spleen, excrement, perspiration, mucus, nasal mucus, fat, lymph, marrow, grease, bile, discharge, pus, blood, brain, cerebrum, and urine. {{page:{number:28,folio:F.15.a}}} It is a bodhisattva’s nature to examine all these entities, and thus, such a thoughtful bodhisattva contemplates, ‘When childish fools who are dull and ignorant encounter these substances they do not feel any desire. So needless to mention that an insightful person would not feel any desire either.’ In this way do bodhisattvas contemplate the repulsive extensively. {{note:{index:41,id:UT22084-064-001-137}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-138}} “What, then, is an object in the form of a beautiful woman? If a bodhisattva sees a desirable lady of fine appearance—someone endearing, beautiful, captivating, and stunning—then he thinks as follows: ‘The Blessed One has taught that all objects are just like a dream. They appear only to disappear again. So what knowledgeable person would feel any desire with respect to objects that are like a dream?’ This is the way that bodhisattvas apply the remedy for desire and give up the conditions for desire to arise.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-139}} “In what way, you may then wonder, do bodhisattvas apply the remedy for anger and how do they abandon the conditions for anger to arise? Bodhisattvas have abundant love for sentient beings. Hence, they give up the bases, causes, and conditions for anger, as well as the causes and conditions for ill will and resentment. This is the way that bodhisattvas apply the remedy for anger and give up the conditions for anger to arise.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-140}} “In what way, you may then wonder, do bodhisattvas apply the remedy for dullness and how do they abandon the conditions for dullness to arise? Bodhisattvas are free of dullness due to their understanding. Moreover, because they are free of dullness they do not lose heart when things do not work out as they wished, or when they are lacking material means, and thus they are free of all the pains of affliction.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-141}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ freedom from incorrect mental engagements consist in? {{page:{number:29,folio:F.15.b}}} Alone and in secrecy, bodhisattvas may leave for their hermitage. Once there, however, they do not think, ‘Living here in solitude I am following the Dharma-Vinaya of the Thus-Gone One. Other mendicants, or brahmins, live with people and are engaged in plenty of social activity. So they have strayed from the Dharma-Vinaya of the Thus-Gone One.’ Such is the bodhisattvas’ freedom from incorrect mental engagements. {{note:{index:42,id:UT22084-064-001-142}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-143}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ fear of karma consist in? Bodhisattvas consider how the Blessed One has taught: ‘Monks, virtuous acts must be engaged in with respect, discipline must be observed with respect, and insight must be cultivated with respect. Why is that? Because when one acts with respect for virtue the karmic ripening will be experienced as desirable, sensible, delightful, and beautiful.’ With conviction in that teaching, they avoid all unvirtuous qualities. Such is the bodhisattvas’ fear of karma.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-144}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ fear of evil consist in? Bodhisattvas perceive even very subtle forms of evil as something frightening and they are careful to avoid even minor forms of negativity. As such, they consider how the Blessed One has taught: ‘Monks, people can die from weak poison just as they die from strong poison. In the same way, lesser negativity takes one to the lower realms just as great negativity does.’ With this in mind they are afraid of evil, and this, then, is the bodhisattvas’ fear of evil.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-145}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ consideration of danger consist in? Brahmins, royalty, townspeople, {{page:{number:30,folio:F.16.a}}} and country dwellers can all rely on a bodhisattva. That is to say, if brahmins, royalty, townspeople, or country dwellers place any of their wealth or possessions, such as cowry shells, gold, precious stones, pearls, beryl, conchs, crystals, or corals, before a bodhisattva with no one else around, the bodhisattva will not covet any of it. If certain things have been dedicated to a shrine or to the saṅgha then bodhisattvas will not partake of them. Instead they will think, ‘The Blessed One has explained that bodhisattvas would rather consume their own flesh than frivolously partake of others’ food, drink, or possessions if they haven’t been given to them.’ Such is the bodhisattvas’ consideration of danger.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-146}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ steadfast commitment consist in? When māras or demonic gods befriend bodhisattvas and speak to them about wealth and sex, they will remain immutable and unchanged, without any damage to their vows. Such is the bodhisattvas’ steadfast commitment.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-147}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ open-ended discipline consist in? When bodhisattvas observe discipline, they do not harbor any wish that it may bring them birth as a god in general, or a specific god, or as royalty, or as some specific king. Such is the bodhisattvas’ open-ended discipline.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-148}} “Noble son, you may wonder about the nature of the bodhisattvas’ discipline that is purified of the three spheres. Bodhisattvas are physically, verbally, and mentally pure. In what sense are they physically pure? By giving up all negative physical acts. What are the negative physical acts? They are killing, taking what has not been given, and sexual misconduct. {{page:{number:31,folio:F.16.b}}} Such is their physical purity. How are they verbally pure? By giving up all negative verbal acts. What are such acts? They are lying, divisive talk, harsh words, and chatter. Such is their verbal purity. How are they mentally pure? By giving up all negative mental acts. What are such acts? They are covetousness, ill will, and wrong view. Such is their mental purity.

{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-150}} “Noble son, you may wonder what the bodhisattvas’ excellent inner patience consists in. Noble son, bodhisattvas are continuously patient and accepting in the face of any internal suffering, lamentation, pain, mental unease, or disturbance.

{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-152}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ excellent outer patience consist in? A bodhisattva’s mother, father, relative, preceptor, or master might speak and express themselves in a way that is derogatory. If bodhisattvas hear such words from others, or if they hear unpleasant words about the Buddha, the Dharma, or the Saṅgha, they will not become angry, develop ill will, or hold a grudge. With patient acceptance they do not develop any malicious intent. Such is the bodhisattvas’ excellent outer patience.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-153}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ excellent patience with respect to the Dharma consist in? Bodhisattvas are not afraid, intimidated, or scared when they hear, among the profound discourses, the Dharma teachings given by the Thus-Gone One that can sever the continuity of existence {{note:{index:44,id:UT22084-064-001-154}}} and bring an unconstrainable freedom from bondage, such as: ‘All phenomena are peace from the beginning, all phenomena are by nature the transcendence of suffering.’ Instead, they think, ‘Without knowing or hearing such teachings I would not be able to fully awaken to unexcelled and complete buddhahood.’ Thus they retain such teachings, contemplate them, practice them, analyze them, and become inspired by them. Such is the bodhisattvas’ excellent patience with respect to the Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-155}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ excellent patience granted by the Buddha consist in? If bodhisattvas feel anger or a wish to harm they will examine where the anger came from, where it ceases, what it arose through, how it arose, and the reason it arose. Once they examine things in this way, they do not perceive any true emergence of anger, nor do they perceive any true ceasing of anger. They do not see any true source of anger, {{page:{number:33,folio:F.17.b}}} nor any way that anger emerges, nor any conditions that caused it to arise.

Bodhisattvas will not be patient during the day yet not at night, nor will bodhisattvas be patient at night but not during the day. They will not be patient in their own country yet impatient abroad, nor will they be patient abroad and yet not at home. They will not be patient with friends yet impatient with strangers, nor will they be patient with strangers yet impatient with friends.

Bodhisattvas are not just patient with their fathers, mothers, masters, sons, daughters, spouses, relatives, and kinsmen, but impatient with others.

Rather, if others strike bodhisattvas, threaten them, insult them, or beat them, they will think, ‘This is the ripening of actions I did in the past. I created this karma, so now it ripens on me. My mother, father, relatives, and kinsmen did not do those acts. Since I am the one who did them, their ripening happens to me. Such acts do not ripen in the outer element of earth, nor do they ripen in the outer elements of water, fire, or wind. They do not ripen in the inner element of earth, nor do they ripen on the inner elements of water, fire, or wind.’ Keeping those insights in mind, they will remain patient regardless of whether the causes, conditions, and bases for such disturbances unfold or not. Such is the bodhisattvas’ excellent unperturbed patience.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-160}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ excellent compassionate patience consist in? A bodhisattva may be a king or a great minister who is rich, wealthy, in possession of many enjoyments, and the ruler of many suffering beings. Even if the beings governed by them are critical, gossip, or speak inappropriately, the bodhisattva will not be angry or hostile. Rather than acting as a ruler, bodhisattvas will instead think to themselves, ‘These beings are under my care and I must provide for them. Destroying those who are under my care would be wrong.’ Thus they embrace such beings with compassion, {{page:{number:35,folio:F.18.b}}} and patiently accept them without any ill will. Such is the bodhisattvas’ excellent compassionate patience.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-161}} “Noble son, you may then wonder about the character of the bodhisattvas’ excellent patience that liberates based on a commitment. In this regard, bodhisattvas think as follows: ‘Before the blessed, worthy, thus-gone, perfect buddhas I have pledged to fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood and liberate all beings who are sinking in the oceanic swamp of cyclic existence. With that lion’s roar I promised to liberate, deliver, and train all beings, establishing them in perfect peace. So it would be wrong if I were to become angry, aggressive, intolerant, and lacking in forbearance.’
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-162}} “Noble son, think of a doctor suffering from cataracts. When there are other beings blinded by cataracts that doctor may think, ‘I shall cure all these beings of their blindness.’ But, noble son, if he himself is blind, will he then be able to relieve all those beings of their cataracts?”
“Blessed One,” replied Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin, “he will not be able to do so.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-164}} “Noble son,” the Blessed One continued, “bodhisattvas similarly wish to relieve the blind world of its cataracts of ignorance. They wish the eye of insight to clear away the stains of unknowing and so they realize that it would be wrong if they themselves remained blinded by the cataracts of ignorance. Hence they practice patience and tolerant acceptance, free from malicious intent. Such is the bodhisattvas’ excellent patience that liberates based on commitment. Noble son, such then is the bodhisattvas’ practice of excellent patience. {{page:{number:36,folio:F.19.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-165}} “Noble son, bodhisattvas who practice excellent diligence possess ten qualities. What are those ten? They are vajra-like diligence, inalienable diligence, diligence free of the two extremes, vast diligence, blazing diligence, continuous diligence, pure diligence, extraordinary diligence, diligence that does not deprecate, and diligence that is free of conceit.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-166}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ excellent vajra-like diligence consist in? Noble son, bodhisattvas muster diligence for the sake of the realms of beings. They are diligent so that those who have not transcended suffering can go beyond it, those who have not yet crossed can be delivered, those who are not yet liberated may be free, those who are not yet assured may receive assurance, and so that those who have not yet truly and completely awakened may truly and completely awaken.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-167}} “The māra Pāpīyān might go before such a bodhisattva and say, ‘Noble son, give up your diligent practice. Why? Noble son, you are diligent so that all those who are not already beyond suffering can transcend suffering. You muster diligence to deliver all those who have not yet crossed, and so that all who are not yet liberated may be free. You are diligent so that those not yet assured may receive assurance, and so that those who have not yet truly and completely awakened may truly and completely awaken. Yet that sort of diligence is false and deceptive, and it fools childish beings. Noble son, I do not know of a single sentient being who has fully awakened to unexcelled and complete buddhahood through mustering such diligence. Nevertheless, noble son, {{page:{number:37,folio:F.19.b}}} I do know of many millions of beings who have gone beyond suffering by means of the vehicle of the hearers and the vehicle of the solitary buddhas. Therefore, noble son, relinquish your diligence! I swear that you will otherwise just cause trouble for yourself for no reason at all.’
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-168}} “Yet when faced with such efforts to make them lose faith and to ridicule them, bodhisattvas will think, ‘Alas, these are Pāpīyān’s attempts to ridicule me.’ With that in mind bodhisattvas will reply, ‘Pāpīyān, you ought to cut down on your work. Why do you bother so much about worldly affairs? Pāpīyān, the Blessed One has taught, “Mundane beings are engaged in the appropriation of karmic action. Thus, they experience their own share of karma, they remain in the world of karma, and they are upheld by karma.” Pāpīyān, you also appropriate karmic action. You experience your own share of karma. Living in the world of karma, you are upheld by karma. Pāpīyān, now leave on the same path that brought you here! I can assure you that your efforts to ridicule me will make you feel useless, hurt, and in pain for a long time.’ Understanding how his own mind is governed by feelings, the demon Pāpīyān will then immediately hide and disappear. Thus the ridicule of all the māras and demonic gods will never make bodhisattvas lose faith. Never will they shudder or lose heart. Such is the bodhisattvas’ vajra-like diligence.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-169}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ inalienable diligence consist in? The qualities of a bodhisattva who engages in this diligence are unmatched in terms of any fraction, number, quantity, analogy, or likeness—even by other bodhisattvas who have long practiced that vehicle, so it goes without saying that hearers and solitary buddhas do not possess such diligence. Bodhisattvas who possess this diligence create the power of diligence within each mind state. Thus they muster a diligence that upholds all the qualities of the Buddha {{page:{number:38,folio:F.20.a}}} and gives up all negative and unvirtuous qualities. Such are the bodhisattvas who possess inalienable diligence.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-170}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ diligence free of the two extremes consist in? The diligence mustered by bodhisattvas is neither overly assiduous nor too weak. Why is that? Because were it too assiduous they would become stressed, and were it too weak they would become lazy. Such is the bodhisattvas’ diligence free of the two extremes.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-171}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ vast diligence consist in? Here bodhisattvas arouse diligence with a wish that their own body might become just like the body of the Thus-Gone One. They wish to become just like the thus-gone ones whether with respect to the imperceptible uṣṇīṣa, or the fathom-wide aura, the perfect major and minor marks, the unimpeded and infinite wisdom, the magnificence of a buddha, or a buddha being the supreme head of the herd. Such is the bodhisattvas’ vast diligence.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-172}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ blazing diligence consist in? Noble son, when gold or a precious jewel is stainless and free of any flaws it is brilliant, bright, and radiant. It may then be spoken of as ‘gold blazing with splendor’ or ‘a jewel blazing with splendor.’ Similarly, the diligence of bodhisattvas is also stainless and free of all flaws. What are the stains and flaws related to diligence? Laziness is a stain and a flaw in relation to diligence. Indolence is a stain and a flaw in relation to diligence. Overeating is a stain and a flaw in relation to diligence. Not understanding oneself is a stain and a flaw in relation to diligence. Inappropriateness is a stain and a flaw in relation to diligence. Incorrectness is a stain and a flaw in relation to diligence. Social activity {{page:{number:39,folio:F.20.b}}} is a stain and a flaw in relation to diligence. These are all stains and flaws in relation to diligence, and bodhisattvas are free of all those. Hence their diligence is blazing and stainless, luminous and pure, and perfectly purified. Such is the bodhisattvas’ blazing diligence.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-173}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ continuous diligence consist in? Bodhisattvas are diligent throughout all their activities. Never do they tire physically, nor do they experience any weariness of the mind. That is called the bodhisattvas’ continuous diligence and in this way bodhisattvas have continuous diligence. {{note:{index:45,id:UT22084-064-001-174}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-175}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ pure diligence consist in? Bodhisattvas who possess continuous diligence will give up all harmful, negative, and unvirtuous factors that present obstacles to the path of awakening. Instead they will increase, enrich, and expand those virtuous factors that are conducive to the transcendence of suffering, the accumulations on the path of awakening, and the perfection of the aspects of awakening. Since not even subtle or minute unvirtuous mind states arise, it goes without saying that the coarse ones do not occur either. This is referred to as pure diligence, and in this way bodhisattvas have pure diligence.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-176}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ extraordinary diligence consist in? Bodhisattvas think as follows: ‘Even if as many worlds throughout the ten directions as there are grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā became engulfed by the great flames of the Hell of Incessant Pain, I would walk through that mass of fire to save just a single being who suffers and who is in need of protection, a guard, shelter, or support. Since I would cross that many worlds just to free a single being, {{page:{number:40,folio:F.21.a}}} I would of course also bear with ordinary types of suffering.’ Such diligence is said to be unshared by any hearer, solitary buddha, or non-Buddhist. It is therefore the bodhisattvas’ extraordinary diligence.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-177}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ diligence that does not deprecate consist in? In this regard, a bodhisattva will never think, ‘Awakening is hard to reach for a human being. My own diligence is little and weak; I am a lazy person. Awakening, on the other hand, is something that one accomplishes over many hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands of eons while practicing as if one’s head were on fire. I don’t feel like taking that sort of obligation upon myself.’ Rather, they think, ‘When the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddhas fully awakened to unexcelled and complete buddhahood in the past, when they fully awaken now, and when they fully awaken in the future, it is always in this sort of way, by this sort of path, and through this sort of diligence. This is how the thus-gone ones have fully awakened to unexcelled and complete buddhahood in the past, this is how they do so now, and this is how they will awaken in the future. And all of them are thus-gone ones—there is no one among them who fully awakened in any other way. Therefore, I too must by all means also fully awaken to unexcelled and complete buddhahood. I shall therefore endeavor in exactly that way by means of a diligence that extends to and focuses on all sentient beings. {{note:{index:46,id:UT22084-064-001-178}}} As I exert myself to benefit all beings, I may well remain in hell. My diligence is indeed not directed at the transcendence of suffering!’ Such is the bodhisattvas’ diligence that does not deprecate.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-179}} “Noble son, you may also wonder about the character of the bodhisattvas’ diligence that is free of conceit. {{page:{number:41,folio:F.21.b}}} When bodhisattvas practice diligence they do not relish the taste of diligence. Their diligence does not make them disparage others, nor does it cause any self-aggrandizement. Rather, bodhisattvas think, ‘What sort of insightful person would make their own diligent activity the grounds for looking down on others?’ Noble son, such is the bodhisattvas’ diligence free of conceit. {{note:{index:47,id:UT22084-064-001-180}}} Noble son, bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities are endowed with excellent diligence.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-181}} “Noble son, bodhisattvas who practice excellent concentration possess ten qualities. What are those ten? They are steadfastness through merit, strong weariness, engendering diligence, great learning, perseverance in the unmistaken application of the instructions, adopting the qualities that accord with the Dharma, sharp faculties, expertise with regard to the mind, skill in tranquility and special insight, and non-attachment.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-182}} “Noble son, you may wonder about the character of the bodhisattvas’ steadfastness through merit. Bodhisattvas gather numerous roots of virtue within the Great Vehicle, and throughout their succession of different lives bodhisattvas practice well and are cared for by spiritual teachers. Thus, wherever they may take birth among the great sāla trees of the brahmin caste, the great sāla trees of the royal caste, or the great sāla trees of the caste of householders, the people of their household will be faithful. Moreover, by the causes and conditions of the bodhisattvas’ birth there, their faith will develop, grow, and expand further still. Bodhisattvas do not separate from their spiritual teachers. Who are their spiritual teachers? They are blessed buddhas or bodhisattvas.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-183}} “When bodhisattvas take birth, due to the power of their affinity with past roots of virtue, they think, ‘Alas, these beings {{page:{number:42,folio:F.22.a}}} are suffering! Alas, these beings are helpless! Alas, these beings are suffering from disease! Alas, these beings have no rest! Alas, these beings have been sick for a long time! Alas, these beings are blinded by ignorance! And all that is caused by desire; all that is due to desire. Therefore, were I also to indulge in desire in the way that worldly beings do, that would not be becoming. So-called “desire” can be understood to be imperfect. Hence also the Blessed One has repeatedly taught about the shortcomings of desire. He says, “Desires are like poles for impalement! Desires are like pikes! Desires are like the edge of a sword! Desires are like the edge of a razor! Desires are like a snake’s head! Desires are like bursting bubbles! Desires are rot! Desires stink!” ’
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-184}} “Therefore, as they become weary in these ways they shave off their hair and beard, donning the saffron-colored robes. Thus, joyfully leaving home to become homeless, they take ordination. As monastics, they muster diligence to attain what had not been attained, comprehend what had not been comprehended, and actualize what had not been actualized. Through such causes, conditions, and bases they retain the teachings that they receive with regard to the relative and ultimate truths. Becoming expert with respect to both truths, they train genuinely in the application of the oral instructions. Diligently training in the instructions without error, they adopt the qualities that accord with the Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-185}} “What are the qualities that accord with the Dharma? They are authentic view, thought, speech, activity, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and absorption. Since the path is comprehended by means of these, they obtain faculties that are sharp, clear, and aware of the path. With faculties that are sharp, clear, and aware, {{page:{number:43,folio:F.22.b}}} they enjoy abundant solitude. They abandon all gatherings and abandon all busyness. They no longer feel any pleasure in talking, and give up thoughts of craving, ill will, and malice, and thoughts about gods. They completely lose interest in gain, fame, and acquisitions. By means of physical and mental disengagement they gain expertise with respect to the mind. Thus they will examine as follows: ‘Is my mind involved in something virtuous, or something unvirtuous, or something neutral? What type of phenomenon does my mind engage with?’ If they find that their mind is involved in virtue they will feel joy, appreciation, and inspiration. As for virtuous qualities, these consist of the thirty-seven factors of awakening.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-186}} “If, however, they find that their mind is involved in something unvirtuous, they will feel great weariness, ponder it extensively, and then strive to abandon those unvirtuous qualities. Which, then, are unvirtuous qualities? Desire, anger, and dullness. Desire is threefold, as there is greater, middling, and lesser desire. As for greater desire, this is when the emotion permeates the entire body and captures the mind completely. In this way one applies oneself entirely to desire without there being any occasion without it. Having given in to desire, one feels no shame or shyness at all. Such complete absence of shame and shyness expresses itself in the following ways: First, shamelessness is when, while one remains alone and in private, one’s mind remains desirous, giving rise to thoughts of desire. Thus one holds desirous situations to be excellent and the emotion to be a good quality. Absence of shyness, on the other hand, is when the causes, conditions, and bases for desire make it so that even if one’s parents, spiritual teacher, or the like object to, oppose, or criticize this, {{page:{number:44,folio:F.23.a}}} one feels no shame about one’s desire, and instead, shamelessly, one holds the emotion to be a valuable quality. Thus, by such causes, conditions, and bases one will come to take birth in the lower realms. This is what is known as greater desire.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-187}} “As for middling desire, this is when someone adheres to desire and then, based on that, follows a course of action through to completion. However, once the activity has been completed, one becomes free of desire, full of regret, and feels that it was inappropriate. This is what is known as middling desire . Lesser desire is when one adheres to desire, yet one is satisfied merely by contact through smelling, rubbing, or other bodily contact, or merely by talking, or seeing. This is known as lesser desire . In short, desire occurs whenever there is craving for any of the requisites of life.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-188}} “What then is anger? Anger is also threefold, as there is greater, middling, and lesser anger. As for greater anger, this is when the expression of furious anger leads to the enacting of any one of the five deeds with immediate consequences, or an act of relinquishing the Dharma. The latter act is much worse than committing all the five deeds with immediate consequences; they cannot compare in terms of any fraction, number, analogy, or likeness. With such causes, conditions, and bases one is, upon the destruction of the body, born as a sentient being in a great hell. If by some rare chance one should be born as a human it will be as someone uncouth, with red eyes, ferocious, and malicious. In turn, with such causes, conditions, and bases, such a person will also be born as a sentient being in hell. This is what is known as greater anger.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-189}} “In the case of middling anger, one will angrily engage in negative, unvirtuous acts, yet quickly, swiftly, and rapidly such acts will be followed by remorse and the application of a remedy. This is what is referred to as middling anger . Lesser anger is when one’s anger causes one to accumulate negative acts through mere words and unpleasant or harsh expressions. {{page:{number:45,folio:F.23.b}}} Although one becomes a little agitated, one immediately relies on a remedy in that very moment. This is lesser anger.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-190}} “What then is dullness? Dullness is also threefold, as there is greater, middling, and lesser dullness. Greater dullness is when flaws of the aforementioned type occur but are accompanied by happiness and are without any sense of pain, without any lamentation, and without regret. This is what is known as greater dullness . Middling dullness is when one engages in negative acts but with rapid subsequent remorse. Thus, misdeeds will not be concealed but confessed before those who maintain pure conduct and, moreover, such deeds will not be considered good qualities. This is known as middling dullness . Lesser dullness does not involve natural misdeeds, but rather a prohibited misdeed that ensues from transgressing two or three deeds of conduct to be observed according to their precepts. This then is lesser dullness.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-191}} “Bodhisattvas are skilled in reversing the mind. As they are experts with respect to the mind, they do not take delight in pleasures, they do not wish for pleasures, and they are not attached to pleasures. Why is that? Because they are experts on the mind. Yet if they nevertheless engage in neutral acts they will apply mindfulness and exertion and apply themselves diligently based on analysis. What is meant by engagement in neutral acts? This occurs when the mind does not move either externally or internally, and when there is no engagement in positive or negative acts, no practice of special insight, nor any observance of tranquility. Instead the mind remains dull and oppressed by torpor. Such a mind is unclear, just as is the case, for example, with the obscured mind state of someone who has just been woken up from a deep sleep. Bodhisattvas are expert at uplifting the mind out of such states, {{page:{number:46,folio:F.24.a}}} at engendering joy, and at placing the mind. Such is the expertise of bodhisattvas with regard to the mind.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-192}} “With their expertise about the mind, bodhisattvas conceive of phenomena as illusion-like, dream-like, virtuous, unvirtuous, occurring, or non-occurring, and while doing so they consider how all these phenomena abide in the mind, arise from the mind, and are preceded by the mind. Thus, they see all these phenomena with the understanding that by purifying, disciplining, and comprehending the mind they will also purify, discipline, and comprehend phenomena. By means of such causes, conditions, and bases, bodhisattvas exert themselves in pacifying the mind. In this way the mind corrects itself. The mind pacifies itself. The mind settles itself. Persevering in this way in pacifying the mind, it becomes one-pointed, and with one-pointedness they accomplish equipoise. Once the mind is in equipoise they experience the joy that arises from disengagement, and with such mental joy they separate from desire as well as from negative and unvirtuous qualities. Thus, while involved in thought and discernment, they experience the joy and bliss that arise from disengagement, perfect the first concentration, and remain within it.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-193}} “From there they endeavor to let thought and discernment disappear. Hence, with a wish not to relish or conceive of joy and bliss they raise their minds above the first concentration. Separating from thought and discernment their minds become detached and they attain an inner brightness that forms a single mental continuum. Thus, based on absorption that is free of thought and discernment they complete the joyous and blissful second concentration and remain within it.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-194}} “Comprehending that {{page:{number:47,folio:F.24.b}}} the second concentration is joyous but also suffering, they think, ‘This is suffering,’ and so they rest in equanimity. While resting in equanimity they are mindful, alert, and their bodies experience pleasure. About this state the noble ones have taught, ‘When one is mindful and blissful, that is equanimity.’ In this way they complete the third concentration free of joy, and remain within it.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-195}} “Then, intent on relinquishing the third concentration, they direct their minds toward the fourth. With the attainment of the fourth concentration they reverse the grasping at a self. As the grasping at a self is reversed, both pleasure and pain will have been relinquished as well. Having here relinquished pleasure, and having earlier already abandoned pain, mental pleasure and mental displeasure now fade away. In this way they complete and remain within the fourth concentration, which is neither pleasurable nor painful, but neutral and endowed with pure mindfulness.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-196}} “Next they focus on their own bodies being one with the body of space, and with that focus they entirely transcend all perceptions of form. As all perceptions of impediment fade away they go beyond all perception of form. All perceptions of impediment fade away and no perception of diversity occurs either. Thus, thinking, ‘This is infinite space,’ they perfect the sense source of infinite space and remain within it. Next, they go beyond the sense source of infinite space and instead conceive of infinite consciousness. In this way they perfect the sense source of infinite consciousness and remain within it. Then, transcending the sense source of infinite consciousness, they feel, ‘There is nothing whatsoever!’ and with that perception they perfect the sense source of nothing whatsoever and remain within it. As they go beyond the sense source of nothing whatsoever, they perfect the sense source of neither presence nor absence of perception and remain within it.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-197}} “Above that there are no further marks of the mind and, as all mental movement ceases, this freedom from all obscuration is what is known as cessation. Considering this as something they must know, bodhisattvas abide in equilibrium.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-198}} “However, they do not see these levels as eternal and delightful abodes. {{page:{number:48,folio:F.25.a}}} Instead they train intensively in a mind of love that is free of resentment, rivalry, and harm, and is expansive, immeasurable, and nondual. When this single-minded inspiration pervades them, they complete the respective level and remain within it. This applies to the first, second, third, and fourth concentration levels, as well as the worlds above, below, and around. Throughout them all they train intensively in a mind of love that is free of resentment, rivalry, and harm, and is expansive, immeasurable, and nondual. When this inspiration pervades them, they complete the respective level and remain within it.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-199}} “The same goes for compassion, joy, and equanimity. These qualities are also trained in by means of a mind that is free of resentment, rivalry, and harm, and is expansive, immeasurable, and nondual. When these single-minded inspirations pervade them, they complete the respective level and remain within it. This applies to the first, second, third, and fourth concentration levels, as well as the worlds above, below, and around. Throughout them all they train intensively in a mind of equanimity that is free of resentment, rivalry, and harm, and is expansive, immeasurable, and nondual. When this inspiration pervades them, they complete the respective level and remain within it. This gives rise to the five superknowledges, yet there is no attachment to them, and thus bodhisattvas continue the pursuit of the qualities that complete the accumulations for awakening.

{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-201}} “Noble son, you may wonder about the character of the bodhisattvas’ expertise concerning the absence of self. Noble son, bodhisattvas reflect on form by means of authentic insight. Likewise, they concern themselves with feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness. As they concern themselves with form they do not observe any arising, origin, or cessation of form. Likewise, neither do they observe any arising, origin, or cessation of feeling, perception, formation, or consciousness. This, moreover, is in terms of the ultimate and not in terms of the conventional nature of things. Thus, neither the nature of the ultimate nor the nature of the conventional are observed as being of an expressible nature. Hence, they persevere with unswerving diligence. With a diligence as if their hair had caught fire, they strive and persist for the benefit of sentient beings. Noble son, such is the bodhisattvas’ expertise concerning the absence of self.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-202}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ expertise concerning the ripening of karma consist in? Bodhisattvas think like this: ‘This worldly life is devoid of intrinsic nature and is just like a dancer’s mask or a city of gandharvas. These sentient beings are also not sentient beings, yet because of their attachment to grasping at a self they do not gain any comprehension of the path. They believe that there could not be any ripening of virtuous and unvirtuous karmic actions unless there exists a self, a being, a life-force, a creature, a soul, an individual, a person, or a human being. However, while indeed no beings exist, the ripening of karma does manifest!’ {{page:{number:50,folio:F.26.a}}} Thus, with this insight, bodhisattvas understand correctly that, although sentient beings do not exist, the ripening of virtuous and unvirtuous karma nevertheless does manifest.

With genuine insight bodhisattvas consider conditioned phenomena in the following way: ‘These conditioned phenomena know no remaining. They are in motion, resembling dewdrops and a waterfall in the mountains. What knowledgeable person would develop attachment to them, or desire them, or be pained by their disappearance?’ Thus, due to such causes, conditions, and bases, they develop weariness, free themselves from desire, and turn their minds toward cessation. Such is the bodhisattvas’ expertise concerning the conditioned.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-204}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ expertise concerning the continuity of cyclic existence consist in? Bodhisattvas think to themselves, ‘Alas, those dwelling within cyclic existence are blinded by ignorance. Attracted to cyclic existence, they are bound by the chains of existence and so they continue appropriating further existence. Because of this appropriation they engage in virtuous and unvirtuous actions and with the formation of virtuous and unvirtuous karmic actions they go from one existence to another. Due to this, they take birth. Once born, they also have to age and die, and with death follows endless pain, lamentation, suffering, and distress, as well as ceaseless turmoil. Thus emerges this great mass of nothing but suffering. Like a turning waterwheel, the wheel of existence continues to spin in this way.’ This bodhisattvas recognize by the power of genuine insight. {{page:{number:51,folio:F.26.b}}} Such is the bodhisattvas’ expertise with regard to the continuity of cyclic existence.

When there is no consciousness there can be no name and form, nor the six sense sources, nor contact, nor feeling, nor any craving either. When there is no craving, there cannot be grasping, and when there is no grasping there is no connection to a future existence. Without such future existence there will not be any birth, and in the absence of birth there cannot be any old age and death. Thus pain, lamentation, suffering, distress, and turmoil will all come to an end.’ Bodhisattvas recognize this by the power of genuine insight. Such is the bodhisattvas’ expertise with regard to the reversal of cyclic existence.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-206}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ expertise with respect to the vehicles of the hearers and solitary buddhas consist in? Bodhisattvas comprehend exactly which teachings lead to the attainments of a stream enterer, a once-returner, a non-returner, and a worthy one who has exhausted defilement. They know which teachings sever the ties of existence, dissolve the processes of continued existence, and truly deliver the transcendence of suffering. Likewise, they know exactly which teachings lead to the attainment of a single rhinoceros-like solitary buddha. All this bodhisattvas comprehend by the power of genuine insight. Yet they do not actualize any of those attainments. Why? Because they think as follows: ‘The realms of sentient beings are my responsibility. I have roared like a lion, promising to liberate all beings who are confined to the wilds of cyclic existence. It would not be right of me to escape from that wilderness alone.’ Such is the bodhisattvas’ expertise with respect to the vehicles of the hearers and solitary buddhas. {{page:{number:52,folio:F.27.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-207}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ expertise with respect to the Great Vehicle consist in? Bodhisattvas pursue all the aspects of their training, yet they do not reify these trainings, nor do they reify any path to train upon, nor anyone who trains. By such causes, conditions, and bases they do not fall into a view of annihilation. Such is the bodhisattvas’ expertise with respect to the Great Vehicle.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-208}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ expertise in giving up the activities of the māras consist in? Bodhisattvas give up unvirtuous company in all regards. Thus they stay clear of those who live in inappropriate places, those who rely on and cultivate the spells of the Lokāyatas, and those who cherish gain, honor, worship, and veneration. They also entirely give up the subsidiary afflictions that are obstacles on the path to awakening and instead they apply their remedies. {{note:{index:48,id:UT22084-064-001-209}}} Such is the bodhisattvas’ expertise in giving up the activities of the māras.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-210}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ expertise in terms of unmistaken insight consist in? Bodhisattvas direct their insight toward the mundane treatises, spells, and the field of craftmanship and the arts. However, they do so for the sake of maturing sentient beings, and not out of a concern for profit, fame, wealth, or respect. They aim to thereby express the greatness of the Thus-Gone One’s teaching, and so their involvement is not due to a perception of desirable qualities within those fields. Moreover, they think to themselves, ‘The sacred teaching is the Dharma-Vinaya of the Thus-Gone One.’ Since they appreciate its good qualities in that way, they do not adopt the views of any non-Buddhists. Such is the bodhisattvas’ expertise in terms of unmistaken insight.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-211}} “Noble son, you may wonder about the character of the bodhisattvas’ expertise with respect to unequaled insight. Noble son, bodhisattvas are aware that within the world of gods, humans, and demigods, including Māra, Brahmā, {{page:{number:53,folio:F.27.b}}} and all the gods, mendicants, and brahmins, there is no one whose insight matches that of the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha. With his special insight, he outshines the entire world of gods, humans, and demigods, including Māra, Brahmā, and all the gods, mendicants, and brahmins.

{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-213}} “Noble son, you may wonder about the character of the bodhisattvas’ skill in dedication. Noble son, without any sense of personal ownership, bodhisattvas offer various forms of flowers and fruits to the buddhas and bodhisattvas three times during the day and three times at night, and all the roots of virtue they dedicate toward the attainment of unexcelled and complete awakening. Trees of perfume, trees of incense, jewel trees, {{page:{number:54,folio:F.28.a}}} wish-fulfilling trees, flowering trees, and fruit-bearing trees they offer without any sense of ownership or possession three times during the day and three times at night to the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and all the roots of virtue they dedicate toward the attainment of unexcelled and complete awakening. {{note:{index:49,id:UT22084-064-001-214}}} They listen extensively to the vast discourses that are to be worshiped and venerated, and from the bottom of their hearts they dedicate their studies to the buddhas and bodhisattvas with a supreme and superior intent. {{note:{index:50,id:UT22084-064-001-215}}} From the bottom of their hearts they rejoice in any virtuous act or practice that serves to complete the accumulations for awakening whenever such acts and practices are carried out by bodhisattvas or other beings throughout the ten directions. All the while they then dedicate the roots of virtue toward the attainment of unexcelled and complete awakening. Shrines {{note:{index:51,id:UT22084-064-001-216}}} devoted to the thus-gone ones and statues of the thus-gone ones they worship with flowers, perfumes, and incense. In so doing they dedicate this practice so that sentient beings may be free of the foul smell of their base character and achieve the fragrance of the thus-gone ones’ discipline. When they sweep and repair such sacred objects they dedicate their work so that sentient beings may be free from repulsive behavior and instead take up beautiful and excellent activities. As they offer flower parasols they do so with the dedication that sentient beings may be free from the torments of the primary and subsidiary afflictions. When they enter a temple, they develop the motivation, ‘I shall deliver all beings to the city of the transcendence of suffering.’ When they go outside, they develop the motivation, ‘I shall free all beings from the prison of cyclic existence.’ When they open the door to their home they form the motivation, ‘I shall open the doors to the joyful destinations with the wisdom that transcends the world.’ When they close the door, they develop the motivation, ‘I shall close the doors to the lower realms.’ When they rest, they form the wish, ‘I shall place all beings at the seat of awakening.’ {{page:{number:55,folio:F.28.b}}} When they lie down to sleep on their right side they think, ‘I shall bring all beings beyond suffering by means of the buddhas’ transcendence of suffering.’ As they get up, they develop the motivation, ‘I shall cause all beings to rise above the occurrence of affliction.’ In terms of the body, when they walk, they think, ‘May all beings walk with the gait of a great being.’ When they sit, they do so with the motivation, ‘May all beings be relieved of the pains of desire, anger, and dullness.’ When they take a bath they develop the motivation, ‘I shall wash away all beings’ stains of affliction.’ When they wash their hands they think, ‘I shall clear away the stench of affliction for all beings.’ When they wash their feet their motivation is, ‘I shall wash away all the dust of affliction for all beings.’ As they brush their teeth they think, ‘I shall dispel all the various stains of sentient beings.’ All physical movements they dedicate to the benefit and happiness of all beings. When they prostrate before shrines devoted to the thus-gone ones they think, ‘May all beings of the world, including the gods, come to worship.’ {{note:{index:52,id:UT22084-064-001-217}}} Noble son, such is the bodhisattvas’ skill in dedication.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-218}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ skill in converting non-Buddhists consist in? For that, bodhisattvas project emanations at the sites where there are non-Buddhists such as the carakas, the parivrājakas, and the nirgranthas. Attempting to mature them, bodhisattvas think, ‘Alas, these beings have been taken by pride. In the past I was unable to train them as their master, so now I shall accept to be their disciple.’ So they take ordination among them. {{page:{number:56,folio:F.29.a}}} Once ordained, they strive, persist, and muster diligence so as to outshine other non-Buddhists in terms of their activities, pursuits, scholarship, and austerities. In this way they end up being venerated as teachers and masters among the non-Buddhists and their words are kept in mind and adhered to. When the bodhisattvas then feel that the non-Buddhists have become close students, they declare, ‘Friends, this is not the path of weariness, freedom from desire, and cessation!’ Having declared the shortcomings of the non-Buddhists, bodhisattvas then inspire them to leave those communities, and establish them in the Dharma-Vinaya of the thus-gone ones.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-219}} “Bodhisattvas will likewise practice pure conduct near non-Buddhists who possess the five superknowledges. Practicing such conduct, they will seek to obtain that teaching, and so they will strive and persist. With such persistence, they accomplish the concentrations, absorptions, and attainments. As they ardently seek to obtain the five superknowledges they become vastly superior to those around them. Much more splendid than the rest, they emerge as supreme masters who are venerated because of their expertise. Once they feel that it is the proper time and place to mature those around them, they will declare, ‘Friends, this is not the path of weariness, freedom from desire, and cessation!’ Having criticized those concentrations, absorptions, and attainments, bodhisattvas will then inspire them to leave those communities, and establish them in the Dharma-Vinaya of the thus-gone ones. Such is the bodhisattvas’ skill in converting non-Buddhists.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-220}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ skill in making others withdraw from objects consist in? When bodhisattvas see a man who is overtaken by great craving and desire, they may feel that the only way to tame such beings is to emanate a fine and lovely girl—the most beautiful girl of all—right next to that desirous man. {{page:{number:57,folio:F.29.b}}} When noticing that the man is completely consumed by desire, the bodhisattva will then let the emanated girl die right there in the bed. Right then, at that very moment, she will begin to rot, stink, and decompose. When the man sees this, he will become shocked and distressed, and full of anguish he will wonder, ‘Who can free me from this foulness?’ At that time the bodhisattva will appear before the man. Having first established the man in one of the three forms of awakening, the bodhisattva will teach him the Dharma. Such is the bodhisattvas’ skill in making others withdraw from objects.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-221}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ skill in dispelling lingering regrets consist in? When bodhisattvas see someone who has committed a deed with immediate consequences or some other unvirtuous actions, they will go before that person and ask, ‘Hey, you, why are you unhappy and depressed?’ The reply may be, ‘Noble son, I have committed a deed with immediate consequences, and so I fear that I shall suffer harm for a long time and that for me there will be no fortune, but only suffering.’ Saying this, that person will be unhappy and depressed. Yet the bodhisattva will let that being receive vows and confess their misdeeds. Thereupon the bodhisattva will teach the most profound Dharma. However, if that person does not relinquish their remorse, the bodhisattva will first gain that person’s trust by performing a miraculous feat or by reading their mind. Once the person has developed genuine trust, he or she will be delighted with the bodhisattva, feel inspired, and have appreciation. And once that person is delighted, inspired, and appreciative, he or she will have become fit for the teaching of Dharma, as they will now regard the bodhisattva as an agreeable person. Before that individual the bodhisattva will then project emanations of the bodhisattva’s parents and say, ‘You there, look here and drop your regrets. {{page:{number:58,folio:F.30.a}}} I am your friend and I am telling you that no one ever went to hell or became deprived of all success by doing what you have done. Neither is it the case that such action cannot be cleared away through wisdom.’ Having said this, the bodhisattva will then sever the life-force of their parents and, as the parents are slain, the bodhisattva will display miracles. At that point the transgressor will think, ‘Since even someone endowed with miraculous powers may slay their parents, then how about someone like me?’ The bodhisattva will then by any means teach that person a Dharma instruction that renders their karma as light as the wings of a bee. Such is the bodhisattvas’ skill in dispelling lingering regrets.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-222}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ skill in protecting sentient beings consist in? When seeing someone who is suited for and capable of receiving the Dharma, yet engages in extremely unvirtuous actions, bodhisattvas will project an emanation as a means for taming that person. If the person is someone who can be trained by a king, they will project a king, but if a great minister must tame that person, then it is a great minister who will be emanated. Likewise, if that person is to be tamed by brahmins, warriors, townspeople, or country dwellers then indeed the relevant type of person will be emanated. For the one who must be trained by gods, a god will be emanated, and to the one who is to be tamed by Vajrapāṇi, the latter will appear. Those who are to be influenced by something frightening will be shown something frightening, whereas those who are to be tamed by beatings, threats, killing, or bondage will be shown just that. The noble will tame those who are to be tamed by the noble. Sentient beings intent on an act with immediate consequences {{page:{number:59,folio:F.30.b}}} or an act to defeat bodhisattvas {{note:{index:53,id:UT22084-064-001-223}}} may be stopped, subdued, or confined to a separate location by various means. An emanation may also be projected to hide an entity that is instrumental for the given act with immediate consequences. Alternatively, sentient beings may also be shown the hells.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-224}} “When bodhisattvas who do not possess superknowledge and who wish to remain unknown see sentient beings who are intent on killing others they respond with great compassion and think, ‘Alas, these beings are intent on ruin! Alas, they wish for destruction!’ Seeing this as clearly as amalaki seeds placed in the palm of their hand, they react with great dejection, thinking, ‘For the sake of just a single being I am ready to bear the suffering of the Hell of Incessant Pain until that being enters the field of the transcendence of suffering without any remainder of the aggregates. Now, all these beings are intent on unvirtuous acts and seemingly wish for the great Hell of Incessant Pain. And yet there is no means for averting this. These beings have short lives and no faith, and I do not have the power either to carry them to a different place or to subdue them. Therefore, once their bodies disintegrate won’t they indeed have to be born in the great Hell of Incessant Pain?’ Thus the bodhisattvas feel compassion. With a concern for the misdeeds of those beings as if they were their own, they enfold such beings with love and, if no other method works, they will even use punishment to correct them. Such is the bodhisattvas’ skill in protecting sentient beings.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-225}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ skill in providing sentient beings with a livelihood consist in? Bodhisattvas may encounter beings who are unfit for and incapable of comprehending the Dharma-Vinaya of the noble ones, and who instead chase after food and clothing, perceiving that alone to be sufficient. {{page:{number:60,folio:F.31.a}}} Bodhisattvas will then teach them various virtuous skills such as reading, sciences, finger calculation, numbers, and mathematics, while avoiding showing them any unvirtuous skills. Such is the bodhisattvas’ skill in providing sentient beings with a livelihood.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-226}} “What, you may wonder, does the bodhisattvas’ skill in accepting consist in? If bodhisattvas obtain a heap of jewels as large as Mount Meru they will accept that, just as they will also accept some inferior thing that they might obtain. Why is that? Because they think as follows: ‘Sentient beings are stingy, greedy, covetous, and avaricious. By such causes, conditions, and bases they continue to surface and sink in the ocean of cyclic existence, as if they were inundated by a mass of water. These gifts, however, will for long provide meaning, benefit, and happiness.’ As they accept them in that way, bodhisattvas do not regard such things to be their own, nor do they develop any attachment to them. Rather, sharing them with all beings, they use them to serve the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha, and to help those who suffer. Hence their benefactors feel uplifted and utterly delighted. {{note:{index:54,id:UT22084-064-001-227}}} Such is the bodhisattvas’ skill in accepting.

Others may have already given rise to the awakened mind, yet they are lazy, have little diligence, and are content with discipline alone. Bodhisattvas will cause such beings to develop diligence. Still others may have transgressed the subtle conduct of their training and by such causes, conditions, and bases have become downcast and depressed, finding no occasion for joy, contentment, or appreciation. For such beings bodhisattvas will seek any means to rouse them from their condition, and so they will teach them the Dharma accordingly.

Such bodhisattvas may, alone and unnoticed, leave for a place of complete solitude. When in the hermitage, the bodhisattvas will want to worship and venerate the thus-gone ones and they will then do so mentally in numerous ways. Such mental worship qualifies as the training in the six transcendences. In what way are the six transcendences included in that? The activity of worshiping and venerating is transcendent generosity. Such worship and veneration takes place by focusing on all beings, which is transcendent discipline. They are also truly inspired and extremely happy to worship and venerate, which is transcendent patience. As they do not feel any weariness while worshiping and venerating, this is transcendent diligence.

Even when beginner bodhisattvas hear the extremely profound Dharma, and when they hear about the profound magnificence of the buddhas, the profound reveling of the bodhisattvas, and about the bodhisattvas’ profound skill in means, they do not then become frightened but are instead utterly and completely fearless. Thus they think, ‘The awakening of the buddhas is infinite. Also the buddhas’ field of activity is infinite, and so is the way that the blessed buddhas mature sentient beings.

Noble son, bodhisattvas truly perceive the arising of the aggregates, as well as their disintegration and cessation. They see that there is no essence to the arising aggregates, that they have no agent, and that they are without substance. They see the disintegration of the ceasing aggregates. Thus they think to themselves, ‘These aggregates are devoid of a self. They do not involve any sentient being, or a life force, or anything substantial, nor do they contain a person. Nevertheless, childish, ordinary beings are attached to conceptions of a self, and so they think, “Our aggregates are the self,” or “Our aggregates contain the self,” or “Our self contains the aggregates,” or “Our self possesses the aggregates.” Thus, due to their attachment to conceptions of a self, they are unable to comprehend the nature of reality.

Thus, they correctly recognize this: ‘Nominal designations of an imaginary nature are applied to temporary phenomena. Those phenomena are indeed not their essential nature, nor are those words their essential nature. They should be considered merely nominal, merely conventional, and so I should not become attached to them. Yet neither are these temporary phenomena entirely nothing. They are extraneous conditions. They depend on extraneous conditions, occur because of extraneous conditions, and cease when separated from those conditions. And in this sense they exist.’ Bodhisattvas recognize this correctly.

Likewise, the wind-like bodhisattvas delight sentient beings with their cloudbanks of numerous bodies. They illumine the infinite and endless world realms of the ten directions with continuous garlands of lightning that flash in boundless colors. In sixty thousand ways they roar with the thunder of the Dharma of true reality. With the wind of compassion, they are truly exalted. They embrace all wandering beings throughout space with the realm of phenomena. In that way they cover all worlds, delivering sentient beings from the lower realms and the unfree states while continuously blessing them in many ways within the pure appearances of excellent marks, signs, and a circle of light. Blessing all the worlds to be adorned with ornamental arrays, they bring supreme joy, contentment, and appreciation to gods and humans. They produce the crops, {{page:{number:86,folio:F.44.a}}} greenery, and trees of both mundane and supramundane qualities of virtue, which bring perfect happiness and bliss. Bringing all beings joy in this comprehensive manner, they empower them with the Dharma in order to bring them further perfect circumstances and joy. Then, causing a downpour of Dharma, they put an end to all decay. Thus, noble son, the bodhisattvas produce the great rainclouds of Dharma.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-307}} “Noble son, you may wonder how bodhisattvas pacify wandering beings’ torments of affliction. Consider, noble son, how the wind carries a sweetly fragrant rain that pacifies the torments of sentient beings by soothing and cooling their bodies. Similarly, for sentient beings, the wind-like bodhisattvas expel the torments of desire, anger, dullness, inferior realms, inferior views, misdeeds, doubt, poverty, negativity, craving for things, separation from the delightful, contact with the repulsive, and disease. Having done that, bodhisattvas pacify all craving for ignoble qualities, and so forth. They pacify all those torments by means of unsurpassable pure discipline, along with unsurpassable aspiration, perception, contact, company, meaningful teaching, and so forth, that is all blended with the rain of the sacred Dharma. Thus, noble son, bodhisattvas pacify wandering beings’ torments of affliction and establish them on the level beyond affliction.

Similarly, bodhisattvas use the wind of those virtuous qualities that they have accomplished and grant to others to bring forth all types of perfect sustenance. In this way they delight all beings. {{page:{number:87,folio:F.44.b}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-309}} “Consider further, noble son, the analogy of the wind. In all world systems the wind produces the vajra circle and the golden circle that hold the surrounding mountains, great mountain ranges, and the four continents. It establishes the oceans that are the sources of jewels. It establishes Mount Meru and Mount Mahāmeru, along with the jewel mountains, the snow mountains, the fragrant mountains, the towns, the forests, the palaces, Jambu­dvīpa, the four continents, the thousandfold universe, the millionfold universe, and the trichiliocosm with all its diverse arrays. Similarly, the wind-like bodhisattvas produce, bring forth, and establish all the heaps of virtue of sentient beings that have been accomplished throughout the ten directions. The completion of the mountains can be likened to worldly merit. The completion of the four great continents and Mount Meru can be likened to the perfections of the hearers. The completion of the thousandfold universe can be compared to the perfections of the solitary buddhas. The completion of the millionfold universe can be aligned with the perfections of the bodhisattvas. The completion of the trichiliocosm can be likened to that which is superior to the entire world yet extends throughout space containing all world realms. It is famed for its utter purity and manifested by those who are intent on worship. It can be likened to the completion of a thus-gone one’s body endowed with the marks of a hundred merits and in constant equipoise. The oceans can be compared to the oceans of absorption. {{page:{number:88,folio:F.45.a}}} The islands, subcontinents, mountains, the four continents, and so forth can be compared to the various practices, retentions, maturations of sentient beings, saṅghas of disciples, and so forth. The towns, forests, and palaces can be compared to the perfectly pure qualities that abound in the buddha realms. The forests of wish-fulfilling trees can be compared to all the perfect qualities of true mastery. Thus they can be compared to the grounds, transcendences, absorptions, retentions, superknowledges, magical abilities, wisdom appearances, masteries, and powers of the bodhisattvas and the perfect buddhas, as well as to their fearlessnesses, unique qualities, and great compassion.

Noble son, think of all the sentient beings living in the countless worlds, as many as there are grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, in each of the ten directions. Then imagine that each of those beings has become endowed with the merit that is the possession of the universal emperors who rule in ten trichiliocosms. Now imagine that the combined merit of all those beings who are thus universal emperors becomes the possession of each one of them individually, so that they all become great universal emperors. In this way, just as you imagined that the nature of every single being in the worlds located in the east is that of universal emperors, next imagine that this is also the case with the beings who are present in all the worlds in the ten directions, as far as space extends. Then further think that each of those beings in all those worlds now comes to possess the heaps of merit that are the possession of Śakra, and that thus they now all becomes Śakras without exception. {{page:{number:89,folio:F.45.b}}} Imagine then that the combined merit of all those Śakras—present across world realms as innumerable as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā throughout each of the ten directions—becomes the individual endowment of each one of them, and that thus throughout all universes, as far as the realm of phenomena extends, all beings have become Śakras in possession of that sort of merit. Imagine further that all those beings who are present throughout universes as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā within each of the ten directions turn into Mahā­brahmās. Then think that each of those Mahā­brahmās possesses the combined merit of them all, so that all of them become Mahā­brahmās with that sort of merit. Then continue by imagining that those beings all progressively become hearers, solitary buddhas, and bodhisattvas who have attained the great grounds, become empowered by the great cloud of light rays, and attained the ten masteries. Then, noble son, if the combined heaps of merit of all those beings, present in this way throughout infinite universes in the ten directions and extending as far as space throughout the three times, were to be multiplied by one hundred times the total number of particles that constitute all the worlds throughout space and time, then that merit would be sufficient for producing a single hair follicle on the body of a thus-gone one.

If the entire heap of merit required for the excellent signs were multiplied by ten innumerably many times, the merit that would ensue could bring forth one among the first twenty-nine marks of a thus-gone one. If, in turn, that merit were multiplied by ten inexpressibly many times then that would be enough to manifest the hair between the eyebrows, which is more radiant and delightful than a thousand stainless full moons. {{page:{number:90,folio:F.46.a}}} If, beyond that, such merit were multiplied by a quadrillion inexpressibly many times, it would yield the crown of a thus-gone one, which is raised above everyone else, imperceptible, and adorned with the crown protrusion. Finally, if that merit were multiplied by inexpressibly many hexillions of inexpressibly many times, then that would bring forth the voice of a thus-gone buddha, endowed with sixty thousand aspects. Since this spontaneously manifests as infinite statements in accord with all perspectives, it satisfies all beings and is understood throughout all realms of the world. Noble son, this is what is understood by a blessed buddha’s marks of enormous merit. Noble son, in this way the thus-gone ones sustain all beings through their inexhaustible accumulations of merit and wisdom, and due to their vast displays.

Imagine if they all came to venerate the merit associated with just one hair follicle of the Thus-Gone One, carrying as many vessels made of gold from the river Jāmbū, and adorned with all sorts of jewels, as there are grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā and extending to the end of space. Even if they were to bring such offerings continuously until the final eon, it would neither eclipse nor exceed the merit that is associated with that single hair follicle.

Similarly, in numerous ways, the wind-like bodhisattvas employ their unhindered and unobstructed wisdom with respect to correct understandings and eloquence to move between, distinguish, illumine, reveal, and bring to attainment all mundane and supramundane perfections. Thus they discern the various teachings, and show which ones cause the lower realms and which ones lead to the higher realms. They determine which ones produce mastery, or an existence in hell, or as an animal, or in the realm of the Lord of Death, or as a human, or as a god, or as a universal emperor.

They determine which teachings belong to the Vehicle of the Hearers and turn one into a hearer. {{page:{number:103,folio:F.52.b}}} They point out which teachings belong to the Solitary Buddha Vehicle and turn one into a solitary buddha, and they show which teachings are of the Great Vehicle by virtue of possessing all supreme aspects, serving as the means for truly accomplishing the welfare of others, being ever excellent, and resulting in omniscience. Likewise, concisely, they declare which teachings pertain to the grounds, transcendences, absorptions, knowledges, masteries, retentions, superknowledges, liberations, powers, fearlessnesses, correct understandings, and the unique qualities. Noble son, in infinite ways such as these, the bodhisattvas employ their expertise in retentions, such as that of the lotus array, to arrange the displays of the Dharma. Thus, bodhisattvas differentiate and arrange the infinite displays of great palaces of distinct Dharma teachings.

Thus, they bring them freedom from evil acts of body, speech, and mind; splendor and freedom from weariness; and the experience of all divine and human perfections. Saving them from all degeneration, and shining with the light of insight, they scatter a rain of the flowers of precious Dharma in the form of requested discourses, proclamations in song, prophesies, teachings in verse, purposeful expressions, declarations, narratives, parables, accounts of former lives, extensive teachings, marvels, and established doctrines. {{note:{index:69,id:UT22084-064-001-378}}} They set forth matters indubitably with accounts that are conventional, unconventional, oblique, inverted, and so forth.

They make others engage with inconceivable modes of illusion, unfold wisdom illusions, and project emanations that joyfully revel in all phenomena, thus ripening sentient beings. Responding to all questions, they satisfy others and bring them expertise in miraculous displays beyond edges and center.

Noble son, the wind-like bodhisattvas similarly blow on the lofty mountains of the merit and wisdom of those sentient beings that have gathered the accumulations throughout many eons, thus revealing their powers, miracles, and great emanations. They let the tune of the unhindered turning of the wheel of Dharma resound, thereby causing those who need training to gain the light of special insight. Crushing the power of intolerable formations and fostering correct mental engagement, they bring about the correct inner abiding of the mind. Based on such excellent absorption, they crush and scatter all bodies comprised of existence, aggregates, elements, and sense sources. Having annihilated all bodies, they crush incorrect thinking and bring about the inconceivable, complete transcendence of the world and the excellent merit without form. Through the destruction of these forms, they cause a pure transformation that remains until the end of time, being beyond center and edge. {{page:{number:106,folio:F.54.a}}} Noble son, thus bodhisattvas cause their virtuous environment, which has been accumulated throughout incalculable eons and contains an ocean of absorptions, liberations, and retentions, as well as a central mountain, light, moon, sun, Dharma ways, forests, houses, and virtuous surrounding mountains, to manifest within the environment of sentient beings who cycle in existence.

Thus they engage in the works and activities of sentient beings. Without ever tiring {{page:{number:122,folio:F.62.a}}} and without any fear, they carry the great load. With stable power and steadfast exertion, they truly practice the transcendences and gradually accomplish the buddha qualities. Their minds are unimpeded and infinite, unequaled and extraordinary.

Likewise, such bodhisattvas attain the divine ear, cognition of the minds of others, memory of past lives, miraculous cognition, knowledge of the exhaustion of defilements, and instantaneous knowledge of the three times. All these are free of hindrance, impediment, or obscuration. They will therefore regard the realms of sentient beings in accordance with reality. They notice certain beings who are involved in negative acts with body, speech, and mind. They notice beings who deprecate the noble ones, and who, based on their misperceptions, engage in acts and develop qualities that pertain to wrong view. They perceive that due to such causes, such conditions, and such bases, when the bodies of those beings disintegrate and they die, they fall into the lower realms and are born in hell. They likewise notice sentient beings who are involved in positive acts with their body, speech, {{page:{number:123,folio:F.62.b}}} and mind. They notice such beings who do not deprecate noble ones and who, based on their correct perceptions, commit themselves to acts and qualities that pertain to correct view. They see that, due to such causes, such conditions, and such bases, their death due to the destruction of the body brings a passage to the joys of the higher realms where they are born among the gods. In this way they regard the realms of sentient beings in accordance with reality, perceiving the virtuous and unvirtuous actions in the realms of sentient beings. Furthermore, they will think, “In the past, when I was practicing bodhisattva activity, I pledged to awaken to buddhahood so that I could lead others to buddhahood as well. Such was my aspiration and it has now been perfected; my pledge has now been fulfilled.” This is what I have heard, and all of it is true. It is reality. In this there is no deception. About these matters I have no doubts or reservations.

Noble son, although we know of the various areas of Jambu­dvīpa by different names, still they are all included within Jambu­dvīpa. They are based on and belong to Jambu­dvīpa. For this reason they are all one continent of Jambu­dvīpa. Similarly, all the vehicles are included in the vehicle of the thus-gone ones.

Tormented by the heat of summer and suffering from thirst, the second person cries to the first, ‘Sir, hello! I’m tormented by the scorching summer heat and I’m suffering from thirst. Please tell me where I can find a lake, a pond, or a pool. Somewhere with cool, clean, clear water. Anything that can cool me and pacify my thirst. Please show me the way.’ Imagine, then, that the person traveling from the east knows the path very well because he has traveled on it before, and that he knows what it is like all the way. Now, if he has seen pure water on his way and himself drunk from it and bathed in it, he can respond, ‘Hello, my friend. Please proceed until you see a fork in the road. Once you get there, you should avoid the road going left and instead take the one to the right. You will then arrive at a lush forest. In the middle of that forest you will find lakes, ponds, and pools, all filled with cool, clean, clear water. Once you are there, you can free yourself from your thirst and heat.’
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-510}} “Noble son, tell me, how will this be for the person who is tormented by the heat of summer and suffering from thirst? Will his heat cool off and his thirst be quenched simply by hearing about the water, {{page:{number:138,folio:F.70.a}}} or simply by giving it some thought? Will he thereby personally know the cool quality of the water?”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-511}} “No, Blessed One. Blessed One, it is only when he himself goes there and enters the water that his heat and thirst will vanish. At that point he will personally know the water’s cool quality.”

The person tormented by the summer heat and suffering from thirst refers to sentient beings, who are tormented by the afflictions and suffer from the craving for objects. The person who knows the way is an image for all bodhisattvas, who are experts regarding the path to omniscience, who have experience with the Dharma, and who have personal knowledge of it.

He does so exclusively for this reason, and never because he is controlled by pride or the wish for wealth, respect, or fame. He does not praise himself with any other irrelevant motive, and his praise is therefore never hypocritical, pretentious, or incorrect. Why is that?

So, for those beings, the thus-gone ones will praise themselves persistently.

I must cure all these beings!’ So the doctor then goes before them and says, ‘Hello everyone, I am a doctor. I know well about illnesses and their causes, and I know how to cure them.’ As he praises his own qualities in this way, the people come to understand what a doctor is, and once they trust him they will follow his cure.

Bodhisattvas worship and venerate the thus-gone ones by means of worshiping the Dharma, not through material worship. They worship with persistence, and act for the welfare and happiness of sentient beings. {{page:{number:187,folio:F.94.b}}} They bring benefit to sentient beings and pursue the aims of sentient beings, never relinquishing their commitment, and never abandoning their bodhisattva activities. They act in accord with what they teach, free of weariness, and without letting go of the mind of awakening. Noble son, this is how they worship and venerate the thus-gone ones. Their worship is not done through material things. And why, noble son, is this so? Because the thus-gone ones are the Dharma body. Hence, in worshiping the Dharma, they worship the thus-gone ones.

They appear for the welfare and happiness of sentient beings, for the sake of benefiting sentient beings, and for the sake of accomplishing the aims of sentient beings. Noble son, the aims of sentient beings could not be accomplished if they were to relinquish their commitment, turn their back on the activities of the bodhisattvas, speak lies, fail to live up to what they had said, fail to abide by their pledge, develop weariness, and separate from the mind of awakening. And why, noble son, is this so? Because the bodhisattvas’ awakening to unexcelled and complete buddhahood depends on accomplishing the aims of sentient beings. If there were no sentient beings, the bodhisattvas could not achieve complete buddhahood. Thus, noble son, they worship and venerate the thus-gone ones by means of worshiping the Dharma. Their worship is not in terms of material things. Noble son, bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities have skill in worshiping and venerating the thus-gone ones.

Just as their love extends to one being, so does it reach all others, pervading throughout all the realms of sentient beings. Pervading all the realms of sentient beings, it pervades the entire field of space. In fact, the great love of the thus-gone ones knows no end or limit.

Because the thus-gone ones have completely relinquished the afflictions along with their imprints, they are at peace, perfectly at peace, thoroughly at peace. Noble son, all minds that contain afflictions are polluted, and when the mind is polluted it will not be in equipoise. The thus-gone ones, however, do not possess any afflictions. They are free of all dust and defilement and have eliminated all imprints of affliction. They have mastered all phenomena and have attained sameness. They have emerged beyond all spheres of meditative absorption and attainments. {{page:{number:192,folio:F.97.a}}} Noble son, every aspect of the thus-gone ones’ conduct is carried out by means of distinct absorptions. Since the thus-gone ones are active in this way throughout the lifespan of the body in which they transcended suffering, it is needless to mention that they are always in equipoise.

“No, noble son,” the Blessed One replied. “And why not, noble son? Because the object of a thus-gone one, which a bodhisattva must accomplish, is inconceivable. Therefore, it cannot be accomplished over three incalculable eons. The eons are to be counted from the point at which a bodhisattva enters the sameness of all phenomena, not from the first arousing of the mind of awakening.”

Needless to mention, then, the case of someone who hears it and memorizes it, holds it, reads it, masters it, and extensively teaches it to others.

Without being preoccupied or upset, and by means of strong wishes and powerful faith, a noble son or daughter may remain attentive to the greatness of the thus-gone ones for a period of seven nights. When seven days have passed, he or she should observe the procedure for worship, wear freshly cleaned clothes, and give rise to devotion. On that night such a person will then behold the thus-gone ones. Alternatively, if one does not proceed in this way, or if the procedure is incomplete, one may still develop a one-pointed mind, and the thus-gone ones will then arrive before oneself at the time of death.”

Having covered his face, he also covered his head, and once his head was covered he used his tongue to cover his body as well. Having covered his body, he covered his lion throne, and when his throne had disappeared, he covered his retinue of bodhisattvas. He next covered everyone in his retinue of hearers, and thereafter Śakra, Brahmā, and the retinue of the guardians of the world. He then covered everyone who was present in the gathering, and in the end he covered completely the entire trichiliocosm. Then the Blessed One withdrew his tongue. Speaking to the entire gathering, he said, “Noble sons, with a tongue like this the thus-gone ones do not tell lies. Noble sons, you must all have faith. Noble sons, you must all have complete faith.

The same is the case with what are designated as feeling, perception, formation, {{page:{number:195,folio:F.98.b}}} and consciousness. Ultimately they do not reify them either, and they are not attached to them. They may speak of the earth element, yet ultimately no earth element is observed and they cannot be attached to it.

Likewise, they may speak of the sense sources of the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. Yet ultimately no sense source of the mind is observed either, and they cannot be attached to it. They may speak of a self, yet ultimately no self is observed, and they cannot be attached to it. They may speak of a sentient being, yet ultimately no sentient being is observed either, and they cannot be attached to it. They may speak of a life-force, a soul, a man, a person, a human, and a human being. Yet ultimately no life-force, soul, man, person, human, or human being is observed either, and they cannot be attached to them. They may speak of a world, yet ultimately no world can be observed, and they cannot be attached to it. They may speak of mundane phenomena, yet ultimately no mundane phenomena can be observed, and they cannot be attached to them.

You may wonder, noble son, why this is so. It is because the ultimate does not arise, does not cease, does not disintegrate, is not accepted, is not discarded, is not conveyed through syllables, is not expressed through syllables, and is not realized through constructs.

Thus they think, ‘These phenomena are deceptive, hollow, insubstantial, like a mirage, like a reflection, like an echo, like an illusion, transient, fluctuating, and dependently originating.

With the presence of the sense sources there will be contact, and if there is contact there will be the appearance of feeling. Due to the causal factors of feeling, craving will affect childish beings, and when upset by craving there will be appropriation. Engagement in appropriation leads to a new existence, and if there is a new existence, there is birth. With birth comes old age, and an aged person will die. In death there is pain, lamentation, despair, and anxiety. {{page:{number:198,folio:F.100.a}}} Thus arises this mass of nothing but suffering. Hence, the wise must persist in eliminating ignorance.

When bodhisattvas see a donor or a benefactor they will not make any indication by saying, ‘I need clothing,’ ‘I have no begging bowl,’ or ‘I need medicine.’ They will not petition the donor or benefactor, and they will not utter any words to such an effect. Thus, bodhisattvas do not acquire things by making hints.

Noble son, bodhisattvas do not seek acquisition in ways that cause physical or mental harm.

Mental harm is to wish for acquisitions and to harbor aggressive thoughts in relation to the possessions of other practitioners who maintain pure conduct.

As soon as the goddess entered that absorption, the great trichiliocosm became as even as the palm of a hand, with a ground made of beryl. There were no dark mountains, nor any ordinary trees. Since the whole environment became pure, there now appeared nothing but wish-fulfilling trees. {{page:{number:220,folio:F.111.a}}} In that pure environment there were springs, ponds, pools, and reservoirs brimming with water of the eight qualities. No ordinary humans were seen, and even the word woman was unheard of. In that pure environment lotus flowers the size of chariot wheels grew, and within each of them appeared bodhisattvas, seated in cross-legged posture. The Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha A­martyā was teaching the Dharma to all these bodhisattvas. This buddha appeared surrounded by Śakra, Brahmā, and many quadrillions of the guardians of the world.

You may wonder, noble son, why that is so. Generosity with material things is insignificant, whereas generosity with the Dharma possesses great miraculous power. And why is that? Because, noble son, while sentient beings revolving within cyclic existence {{page:{number:221,folio:F.111.b}}} have abundant experience with material things, they have never experienced the taste of the Dharma that is beyond the world.

Noble son, this is the discipline of the bodhisattvas.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-766}} Then, by the power of the Buddha, all the great hearers who were present in the gathering rose from their seats and draped their Dharma robes over one shoulder. Kneeling down on their right knees, they joined their palms. Thus, facing the Blessed One, they said, “Blessed One, when we brought an end to the great cycle of births it was also through hearing of this intrinsic nature.” {{page:{number:222,folio:F.112.a}}}
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-767}} “Monks, so it is,” replied the Blessed One, “so it is.” And he then spoke to the vast gathering: “Noble sons, wherever this Dharma teaching is explained and given, that location is to be seen as the seat of awakening, and the event is to be understood as the turning of the wheel of Dharma. This teaching should be regarded as a great shrine, and you should think, ‘Herein resides our Teacher.’ And why, noble sons? Because its intrinsic nature is awakening. Its intrinsic nature is the turning of the wheel of Dharma. Noble sons, the thus-gone ones are the Dharma body; so, noble sons, by worshiping the Dharma you worship the thus-gone ones.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-768}} “Any place where a Dharma teacher resides should likewise be understood to be a shrine, and the teacher regarded as a guru, a spiritual teacher, and a revealer of the path. When meeting a Dharma teacher, one should respond with joy, faith, and delight. Respectfully, one should prepare a seat for that Dharma teacher, offer praise, and frequently express one’s approval of the teaching.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-769}} “Noble sons, even if I were to praise the qualities of the teachers of the Dharma for an eon or more, it would not be of the slightest benefit to them. And why not? Because, noble sons, expressions of veneration, respect, and praise are not important to them. Noble sons, even if, yearning for this Dharma, a noble son or daughter were to sprinkle with their own blood the path that their Dharma teacher is to walk upon, this would not be of any benefit to the teacher. And why is that? Because, noble sons, it is hard to receive the Dharma way of the thus-gone ones.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-770}} “Noble sons, when a Dharma teacher explains, presents, and illumines this Dharma discourse, he or she should do so without fear, timidity, faintheartedness, or hostility. The teacher should wear freshly cleaned clothes and arouse faith. He or she should think, ‘Even though they may praise me, {{page:{number:223,folio:F.112.b}}} I shall not take that as a cause for arrogance or pride. Without praising myself, without belittling others, and without any concern for material things, I shall teach the Dharma.’ ”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-771}} Now Śakra, king of the gods, turned to the Blessed One, saying, “Blessed One, I shall be present with my army and retinue wherever this Dharma teaching may be delivered and explained. We shall provide for those who listen and teach.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-988}} “Excellent, Kau­śika, excellent,” replied the Blessed One. “You must do just that. Kau­śika, you must guard the intrinsic nature of the thus-gone ones.”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-773}} The bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin now addressed the Blessed One: “Blessed One, what is the name of this teaching of the Dharma, and how shall we identify it?”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-987}} “Noble son,” replied the Blessed One, “you should know this Dharma teaching as The Jewel Cloud, The Teaching on the Source of Jewels , and The Lamp of Wisdom . You should also know it as The Questions of Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin .”
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-775}} When the Blessed One had spoken, the bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkam­bhin rejoiced, as did the other bodhisattvas, the great hearers, Śakra, Brahmā, the guardians of the world, Mahe­śvara, the gods of the pure abodes, and the other millions of gods. Further, hundreds of thousands of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas also rejoiced in the words of the Blessed One.
{{milestone:UT22084-064-001-776}} This completes the Noble Great Vehicle sūtra known as “ The Jewel Cloud .”
