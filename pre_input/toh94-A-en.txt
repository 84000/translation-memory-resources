{{milestone:{label:1.2,id:UT22084-045-001-29}}}Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing at Śrāvasti, where he had observed the summer retreat. After the three months of summer had passed, he prepared his Dharma robes. Once he had prepared his Dharma robes, he put on the robes, took up his alms bowl, and, together with one hundred thousand monks and eight hundred million bodhisattvas, proceeded toward the city of Vaiśālī. On the way, the Blessed One entered a large forest, where he later arose from meditative seclusion.
{{milestone:{label:1.3,id:UT22084-045-001-30}}}The bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja, {{page:{number:2,id:UT22084-045-001-13857,folio:F.2.a}}} who had also entered meditative seclusion, now likewise reemerged from this state. He and the whole assembly of monks, nuns, male lay practitioners, female lay practitioners, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahorāgas were now seated on their mats. All of the assembled bodhisattvas had attained illumination, retention, and absorption. They were endowed with the five superknowledges, their words were worthy of retention, and they were free from pretense, had no worldly ambitions, and were free from attachment. They taught the Dharma without any regard for material things. They had perfected acceptance of the profound Dharma, had accomplished fearlessness, and were beyond the actions of the māras. They had shed karmic obscurations, achieved the state free from any doubt about the nature of the Dharma, and accumulated aspirations throughout countless eons. They had smiles on their faces, spoke straightforwardly, and never frowned. They communicated in melodious voices, their minds were indomitable, and the flow of their eloquence was unbroken. They had achieved acceptance of equality. They were able to outshine infinite gatherings without any fear. They were adept at elaborating on a single word throughout ten million eons.
{{milestone:{label:1.4,id:UT22084-045-001-31}}}They were confident that all phenomena are just like illusions, a mirage, the moon in water, dreams, and echoes. Their minds were endowed with infinite fearlessness, and they were confident in knowing the most subtle movements in the minds of sentient beings, as well as every aspect of their conduct. They possessed vast virtue {{page:{number:3,id:UT22084-045-001-13858,folio:F.2.b}}} and their minds were unimpeded. They were free from exaggerating pride and endowed with patience. Their virtues were genuinely comprehensive. Their aspirations encompassed infinite arrays of buddha realms. They constantly manifested the absorption of recollecting the buddhas of countless world systems. They were skilled in supplicating boundless buddhas. They were skilled in quelling differing views, as well as latent tendencies and the fetters of emotional defilements. They were skilled in accomplishing hundreds of thousands of displays through absorption. They included the bodhisattva Maitreya, as well as the youthful Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Sound of Thunder,{{note:{index:10,id:UT22084-045-001-32}}} Mind of Blooming Flowers of a Hundred Thousand Virtues, Possessor of the Mind of Infinite Practice and the Speech That Is Adorned with Flashes of Lightning, Possessor of the Mind of Complete Detachment, King of Renown, Perceiver of the Agreeable and the Disagreeable, King of the Splendid Light of Deep Accumulations of Gold, Seeing and Moving Across a Hundred Yojanas, Heaps of Eloquence, Mass of Wisdom, Amoghadarśin, Bhadrapāla, the Eight Holy Beings,{{note:{index:11,id:UT22084-045-001-33}}} Gandhahastin, Jewel Treasury, Heaps of Insight, Array of Offerings, King of the Melodious Lion’s Roar, Adorned with Arrays of Wisdom, Moving with the Gait of a Lion, Fearless in Limitless Mastery of Eloquence, the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja, and others.
{{milestone:{label:1.5,id:UT22084-045-001-34}}}From the world systems of the great trichiliocosm came the Four Great Kings, Śakra, Brahmā, Īśvara, Mahābrahmā, {{page:{number:4,id:UT22084-045-001-13859,folio:F.3.a}}} nāga leaders, yakṣa leaders, asura leaders, garuḍa leaders, kinnara leaders, mahorāga leaders, and gandharva leaders, arriving in the presence of the Blessed One, scattering flowers before him, and then taking their places in the gathering.
{{milestone:{label:1.6,id:UT22084-045-001-35}}} At that time, the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja observed seven days of fasting during which he would either stand or sit upright, practicing with unrelenting diligence, free from drowsiness and without sleep. It was then that the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja spoke to the Blessed One: “Which quality must bodhisattvas perfect in order for them to know the thoughts and conduct of all sentient beings, to apply the words that have the intent of all the buddhas, to avoid teaching based on incorrect teachings, to follow knowledge grounded in truth as literally expressed, and to become free of any obscuration with respect to all the buddhas of the present? Through which quality may they be able to accompany and perceive the buddhas, achieve certainty through the Dharma, follow the ways of the world without becoming stained by the world, abide in meditative attainments without taking birth in the corresponding realms, practice the Dharma of nirvāṇa without transcending suffering, and practice the Dharma of hearers and solitary buddhas in which the aspirations of buddhahood are not perfected, without achieving deliverance through those vehicles? Through which quality may their minds be unclouded in recollecting the buddhas, may they engage with the different dispositions and also be in accord with them all, not become overpowered by any question or eloquence, {{page:{number:5,id:UT22084-045-001-13860,folio:F.3.b}}} apprehend all the infinite displays of the buddha realms, attain all forms of insight, bring sentient beings to maturation without adhering to the notion of ‘sentient being,’ teach the Dharma yet not fixate on any objective references, explain nirvāṇa yet not objectify this peacefulness in any way, act for the sake of awakening without fixation, and give up existence, as well as no existence, but aspire to what is vast? Blessed One, I do not ask in this way without any knowledge. Nevertheless, please explain.”
{{milestone:{label:1.7,id:UT22084-045-001-36}}}Then the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja spoke these verses:

{{milestone:{label:1.19,id:UT22084-045-001-49}}}The Blessed One then spoke to the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja: “Excellent, Prāmodyarāja, excellent! I possess the absorption called elucidating the way of all phenomena. When bodhisattvas possess that absorption, they attain those qualities. Furthermore, they perfect one hundred and twenty-one perfections. They attain eighty-four thousand absorptions and eighty-four thousand retentions.

They rose, joined their palms in veneration, and facing in the direction of the Blessed One, they all spoke with one voice: “In the future time of repression—when Dharma teachers are disparaged and the wisdom of omniscience is denied, when the teachings are destroyed and the vision of wisdom is slight, when virtuous factors disintegrate and the means of livelihood vanish—we shall relinquish concern for our own body and life, and cut through all that is held to be pleasurable, as if with a sword. The path of the thus-gone ones, the seal of the flawless rich treasures of eloquence, the ocean that brings together the roots of virtue, and the retentions that subdue the māras and accomplish omniscience are conveyed in discourses such as this one.

The thousands of bodhisattvas likewise all attained this absorption. The teaching brought delight to one million gods, future teachers of the Dharma, who thus proceeded irreversibly to awakening. Seven billion gods purified the Dharma eye that regards all phenomena. One hundred and eighty million members of the fourfold retinue of humans attained the Dharma eye that regards all phenomena. {{page:{number:32,id:UT22084-045-001-13887,folio:F.17.a}}} All of the three lower realms were thoroughly pacified. The light of the Blessed One lit up as many world realms in the ten directions as there are grains of sand in the Gaṅgā. At that moment happiness came to all sentient beings, from the summit of existence down to the Hell of Ultimate Torment. Out of the Blessed One’s light appeared trillions of lotuses, each with a hundred thousand petals and adorned with infinite jewels. Upon each of those flowers was a thus-gone one, just like the blessed Śākyamuni, surrounded by his retinue. Each of them received the supplication of Prāmodyarāja, and each one consequently taught this absorption, allowing innumerable sentient beings to proceed irreversibly to unexcelled and perfect awakening.

Chapter 2
{{milestone:{label:2.1,id:UT22084-045-001-189}}}The Blessed One then said this to the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja: “Prāmodyarāja, in this way you must devote yourself to generosity and make offerings to the Dharma. Prāmodyarāja, long ago, many incalculable eons in the past, there was a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a complete and perfect buddha known as Golden Beauty, King of the Splendid Light of Ascertainment. His lifespan was unfathomable, the features of his buddhafield were infinite, and his retinue was beyond count.
{{milestone:{label:2.2,id:UT22084-045-001-190}}}“Later, during the final five hundred years of the teachings, there appeared a Dharma teacher by the name of Treasury of Engagement with the Infinite Jewel Body of Renown. When he taught this absorption all the other monks had completely strayed from the teachings. Nevertheless, this Dharma teacher was undeterred. Without concern for his own body and life, {{page:{number:33,id:UT22084-045-001-13888,folio:F.17.b}}} he inhabited charnel grounds, living from roots and fruits, and thus he taught this absorption. At that point, the gods from the Heaven of the Four Great Kings through to the Unexcelled Heaven came to listen to his teachings. At that time there was also a universal monarch known as Roar That Causes Widespread Happiness and Freedom from Pain, who came to listen to that Dharma teacher’s explanation of this absorption. When he had received the teaching, he gave the gift of freedom from terror as he said to the Dharma teacher, ‘Monk, please teach this absorption, which the buddhas have genuinely bestowed. I shall protect and take care of you.’
{{milestone:{label:2.3,id:UT22084-045-001-191}}}“The monarch arranged for one thousand of his sons to be the teacher’s guards, and with his boundless attitude he arranged for thirty thousand people to provide pleasant living conditions. Thus, living comfortably, the teacher taught this absorption for half an eon. Due to the roots of virtue resulting from this, the Dharma teacher, the king, his sons, and all the other people involved came together to please three billion buddhas over a period of eighty eons, and they received this absorption from each of them. In accordance with their wishes, they also took up residence in buddha realms. Prāmodyarāja, you may believe that teacher was someone else, but you should not think so. He was none other than the thus-gone Amitāyus. The universal monarch was the thus-gone Akṣobhya, and the one thousand princes are the thousand buddhas of the Good Eon. And, Prāmodyarāja, all the other thirty thousand bodhisattvas were the beings who provided for, protected, and sustained the Dharma teacher in accordance with his wishes.
{{milestone:{label:2.4,id:UT22084-045-001-192}}}“Prāmodyarāja, since this is the absorption of the bodhisattvas, {{page:{number:34,id:UT22084-045-001-13889,folio:F.18.a}}} you must genuinely accomplish it.

{{milestone:{label:2.18,id:UT22084-045-001-209}}}Then eighty-four thousand Licchavis who were gathered inside Vaiśālī and another eighty-four thousand Licchavis who had assembled outside Vaiśālī thought to themselves, “In order to benefit many beings, in order bring happiness to many beings, and out of love for the world, the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha has appeared in the world in order to help gods and humans and bring them happiness. But now the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha has entered meditative seclusion. Who among us should now request that he rise from the absorption of the thus-gone ones?”
{{milestone:{label:2.19,id:UT22084-045-001-210}}}The Licchavis who were assembled inside Vaiśālī went before the venerable Śāriputra and said, {{page:{number:36,id:UT22084-045-001-13891,folio:F.19.a}}} “Venerable Śāriputra, at the time when the lifespan is short, the appearance of a buddha is rare, and faith is also rare.

{{milestone:{label:2.20,id:UT22084-045-001-211}}}Upon hearing those words, the venerable Śāriputra went to the place where the Blessed One was residing. Yet, although Śāriputra searched for the Blessed One’s dwelling by entering meditative concentration and absorption, he could not discover the abode of the Thus-Gone One.
{{milestone:{label:2.21,id:UT22084-045-001-212}}}The venerable Śāriputra then went to see the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, explaining to him about the intents and wishes of the Licchavis. In response, the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana applied his miraculous abilities, thus causing the entire trichiliocosm to tremble and shake, and his voice reverberated through the whole world below the Realm of Brahmā, requesting the Thus-Gone One to reemerge from absorption. Yet the Blessed One did not emerge.

Encircling the Blessed One, they took their seats. The Four Great Kings, Śakra who rules the gods, and innumerable gods of the desire realm arriving from the Heaven Free from Strife, {{page:{number:37,id:UT22084-045-001-13892,folio:F.19.b}}} the Heaven of Joy, the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, and the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations likewise reached where the Blessed One resided. They bowed their heads before the Blessed One’s feet and then stood to one side. Likewise, from the heavens of Brahmā, Luminosity, Perfected Virtue, Great Fruition, and all the way up to the pure abodes, innumerable gods arrived. They all paid respect to the Blessed One and took their places.
{{milestone:{label:2.23,id:UT22084-045-001-214}}}By then the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja had dwelt undistractedly in meditative seclusion for seven days. When that period of seven days had passed, he began to discern and arose from meditative seclusion. Arriving at the courtyard where the Blessed One resided, he entered among the masterful bodhisattvas, bowed down, and then took his seat with his palms joined, facing the Blessed One.
{{milestone:{label:2.24,id:UT22084-045-001-215}}}Fully aware, the Blessed One now reemerged from his absorption. With the gaze of an elephant, he silently gazed upon the whole gathering.
{{milestone:{label:2.25,id:UT22084-045-001-216}}} The bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja at that point made this request to the Blessed One: “It is time for the Blessed One to deliver a Dharma discourse. If the Blessed One will grant me the occasion, I would like to request that certain matters be explained.”
{{milestone:{label:2.26,id:UT22084-045-001-217}}} The Blessed One then said to the bodhisattva, Prāmodyarāja, {{page:{number:38,id:UT22084-045-001-13893,folio:F.20.a}}} “Noble son, you may ask the Thus-Gone One whatever you wish. I shall respond to all your questions. I shall satisfy you in this way.”
{{milestone:{label:2.27,id:UT22084-045-001-218}}} The bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja now made the following request to the Blessed One: “Blessed One, while I resided alone in the forest in meditative seclusion, I thought, ‘These bodhisattvas gain true accomplishment for the sake of awakening. By means of the perfections they accumulate roots of virtue for the sake of awakening.’ But I wonder, Blessed One, do the perfections benefit sentient beings or are they beneficial for awakening—are the perfections defiled or are they undefiled? I request the Blessed One to please explain these matters at length so that the perfections may develop in the bodhisattvas; so that the Dharma ways of the bodhisattvas may be engendered and upheld in the beginning, middle, and end; and so that such skillful practices may become the source of abundant, supreme joy.”
{{milestone:{label:2.28,id:UT22084-045-001-219}}} The Blessed One replied, “Excellent, excellent, Prāmodyarāja! It is very good that you wish to question the Thus-Gone One about these matters, Prāmodyarāja. Indeed, you have posed this question to nine hundred million buddhas in the past. Therefore, Prāmodyarāja, listen very well and keep my words correctly in mind; I shall explain it to you.”
 “Blessed One, I shall do just as you say.”
