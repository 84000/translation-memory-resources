# 1. Objectives:

The purpose of this project is to create simple phrase-by-phrase, English-Tibetan translation memories by aligning 84000's published English translations with the Tibetan source texts found in the eKangyur (based on the Derge edition of the Kangyur). Our objective is to (1) create TMs as a resource to used on CAT platforms such as OmegaT, and (2) create useful data for other digital Tibetan tools and projects such as word alingers, spell checkers, translation machine learning, and perhaps aligning our Tibetan-English segments with segments created by other groups who are creating canonical TMs from Chinese, Sanskrit, or other sources. 

Because of this, it is important that we standardize our process for creating TMs for the best possible degree of consistency. Standards for the TMs in terms of segment length and structure need to be defined in a clear way so that they will be segmented constistly by all the TM editors working on the project. Also the TMs for each text need to be complete and contain all strings of the English and Tibetan texts including repetitions and strings that are omitted in either the source or target, although the latter can be removed from the TMs for use in CAT platforms like OmegaT. 

For all of the TMs created previously, before 9/01/2019, this had not been the case because the TMs were mainly created primarily with their use with CAT tools in mind. Although these previous TMs may still be useful data for the other projects mentioned above, they are not ideal because they contain a significant amount of omissions and inconsistencies. These previous versions will all be labeled -v1.0… and all the TMs created according to these new guidelines will be labeled -v2.0...

To align the Tibetan-source and English-target two text files will be generated with scripts and InterText application will be used to actually create the alignment and generate the .tmx files.
