After running the "postprocess-" scripts:

1) The initially folio reference will need to be entered into the <prop> element since this was probably omitted in the TMX due to the unused Santskrit title.

2) The @eft:text-id="INPUT_TEXT_ID" needs to be entered in the <header>

3) Optional: search through the file for "<eft:flag" enter in an explanation for each, e.g.: 

	<eft:flag type="alternativeSource">Translated from Sanskrit, see note.</eft:flag>

4) After importing to 84000 database run the "1.29.7.xq" script.
