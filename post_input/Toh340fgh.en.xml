  <p id="5">
    <s id="5:1">$3 The Blessed One taught him three lines of the Dharma:</s>

    <s id="5:4">Nirvāṇa is peace.</s>
    <s id="5:5">Let your mind be filled with joy at the thought of me, and you may even be released from rebirth in the animal realm.”</s>
    <s id="5:6">The peacock was delighted and gazed upon the Buddha’s countenance for a long time.</s>

  <p id="6">
    <s id="6:1">$4 Then, as he flew up into the sky above, he was killed by a falcon.</s>
    <s id="6:2">He died filled with joy at the thought of the Blessed One, transmigrated, and took rebirth into the family of a trader there in Rājagṛha.</s>

  <p id="8">
    <s id="8:1">$6 One day, in admiration for the Buddha, admiration for the Dharma, and admiration for the Saṅgha, he asked for his parents’ permission and went forth.</s>
    <s id="8:2">Though he was just seven years old, he cast away all afflictive emotions and manifested arhatship.</s>
    <s id="8:3">After he manifested arhatship he became a person of great miracles and great power.</s>

  <p id="9">
    <s id="9:1">$7 When the monks saw all this they were amazed and requested the Blessed One,</s>

    <s id="18:1">$15 “Now in times when a blessed one has not arisen in the world, the solitary buddhas appear.</s>
    <s id="18:2">So it was that a solitary buddha was leaning up against a tree directly in front of the king.</s>
    <s id="18:3">To catch the king’s attention, the solitary buddha made a sound like he was clearing his throat.</s>
    <s id="18:4">When the king heard it, he leapt up in terror, thinking,</s>

    <s id="20:2">A little such food hung in King Brahmadatta’s horse’s side bag, and he offered these provisions to the solitary buddha.</s>

  <p id="21">
    <s id="21:1">$18 “The solitary buddha then carried the king up into the sky and established him in a state of fearlessness, whereupon the king prayed,</s>

  </p>
  <p id="32">

  <p id="42">
    <s id="42:1">$35 They reared young More Majestic on milk, yogurt, butter, ghee, and milk solids, and he flourished like a lotus in a lake.</s>
    <s id="42:2">As he grew up he studied letters, brahminical customs and conduct, the syllables oṃ and bho , ritual purity, ritual actions , the collection of ashes, holding the ritual vase, the Ṛg Veda , the Yajur Veda , the Sāma Veda , the Atharva Veda , how to perform sacrificial rites, how to lead others in performing sacrificial rites, how to give and receive offerings, recitation, and recitation instruction.

  <p id="43">
    <s id="43:1">$36 One day the brahmin Majestic Body had the thought,</s>

    <s id="43:4">“The ascetic Gautama is omniscient and all-seeing, and that being the case, there is nothing he does not know—there is nothing in the past, present, or future that he does not see, know, or directly perceive.</s>

    <s id="45:1">$38 Once he had taken a seat at one side, the brahmin Majestic Body asked the Blessed One,</s>
    <s id="45:2">“Gautama, I have started a great sacrifice, and to perform that great sacrifice I have tied five hundred of the finest bulls to a post, as well as cattle, male and female buffalo, riding horses, calves, young calves, goats, sheep, and even insects.</s>
