  <p id="4">
    <s id="4:1">$2 Thus did I hear at one time.</s>
    <s id="4:2">The Bhagavān was residing in Śrāvastī, in the Jeta Grove of Anāthapiṇḍada’s park,</s>
    <s id="4:3">together with a great saṅgha of one thousand two hundred and fifty bhikṣus and a full five hundred additional bodhisattvas.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="5">
    <s id="5:1">$3 While the Bhagavān was residing in the town of Śrāvastī,</s>
    <s id="5:2">its king and his senior ministers, the brahmins, householders, and people from the greater township, along with their families, paid respect, offered reverence and veneration, and presented offerings to the Bhagavān</s>
    <s id="5:3">so that he received much fine food, drink, and other items to be eaten and sipped.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="6">
    <s id="6:1">$4 He was a blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha, one with perfect knowledge and conduct, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a charioteer who tamed beings, an unexcelled being, and a teacher of gods and humans.</s>
    <s id="6:2">The Blessed Buddha was renowned for his outstanding caste, outstanding clan, outstanding patrilineage, outstanding discipline, outstanding absorption, outstanding insight, outstanding liberation, and outstanding wisdom vision of liberation.#6</s>
    <s id="6:3">The Bhagavān’s fame and renown was thus widespread throughout the world.</s>

    <s id="7:1">$5 The Blissful One, the knower of the world, the charioteer who tames beings, the unexcelled being, the teacher of gods and humans, the blessed Buddha, was also teaching the Dharma.</s>
    <s id="7:2">That is, he was genuinely and fully teaching the sanctified conduct: what is virtuous at first, in the interim, and in the end, what has excellent meaning and excellent words, and what is unadulterated, perfect, [275.b] pure, and cleansed.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="8">
    <s id="8:1">$6 He was also in possession of the five eyes,</s>
    <s id="8:2">namely the eye of flesh, the divine eye, the eye of Dharma, the eye of insight, and the eye of a buddha.</s>
    <s id="8:3">The Bhagavān had soundly defeated non-Buddhist schools such as the carakas, the parivrājakas, and the followers of the Nirgrantha Jñātiputra.</s>
    <s id="8:4">Gods and humans wholly adopted the Bhagavān’s teachings and so they spread everywhere.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="9">
    <s id="9:1">$7 Early one morning, the Bhagavān dressed in his Dharma robes and skirt and</s>
    <s id="9:2">took up his alms bowl. The assembly of bhikṣus, the saṅgha of bhikṣus, along with the bodhisattva mahāsattvas, surrounded him and accompanied him.</s>
    <s id="9:3">He was beautiful to behold from the front, the right, and the left;</s>
    <s id="9:4">his strides were beautiful.</s>
    <s id="9:5">Wearing the Dharma robes—the outer robe, the upper robe, and the inner robe—and the strainer and the alms bowl, he was beautiful.</s>
    <s id="9:6">His complexion was golden, and he radiated an aura of light a full arm span around him. It was like a mass of fire amidst the darkness of night,</s>
    <s id="9:7">like the full moon on the fifteenth lunar day, and like the shining of the sun. He possessed the thirty-two signs of a superior being.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="10">
    <s id="10:1">$8 They went to receive alms in the town of Śrāvastī,</s>
    <s id="10:2">and at the very moment that the Bhagavān set his foot down at the threshold of the gate, reaching the town,</s>
    <s id="10:3">some magnificent, amazing, miraculous feats took place.</s>
    <s id="10:4">I shall recount the incredible, great miracles that occurred when the holy being, the Guide, arrived,</s>

    <s id="11:7">The pleasant sounds of great gongs, earthen drums, and steel drums were audible, although none were struck.</s>
    <s id="11:8">Ducks, geese, herons, peacocks, parrots, and cuckoos voiced their [276.a] delightful songs.</s>
    <s id="11:9">Those who had lost their fortunes recovered them.</s>
    <s id="11:10">Vessels made of gold and silver rang out, although none were struck.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="12">
    <s id="12:1">$10 The earth itself rumbled and shook six times,</s>
    <s id="12:2">and no beings were left without refuge,</s>
    <s id="12:3">as their minds were filled with sincere trust.</s>
    <s id="12:4">Wherever strode the feet of the most eloquent and holy Buddha, there appeared immaculate lotuses in elegant arrangements.</s>

    <s id="13:1">$11 Those beings born in the animal realm who saw him found happiness and would be reborn in the higher realms.</s>
    <s id="13:2">Those women who were pregnant gave birth, without the slightest discomfort, to fine-featured, attractive babies.</s>
    <s id="13:3">No beings harmed one another out of attachment, aversion, or indifference.</s>
    <s id="13:4">They spoke to one another in the most non-aggressive manner,</s>
    <s id="13:5">the way a father or mother would speak to an only child.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="14">
    <s id="14:1">$12 The sides of the road became beautifully decorated.</s>
    <s id="14:2">All the gods dwelling in the heavens above copiously tossed flower petals.</s>
    <s id="14:3">There were no beings left who underwent suffering.</s>
    <s id="14:4">Beings who had been ill became free from illness and so felt happy.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="15">
    <s id="15:1">$13 As the Blissful One passed by,#7 each person wondered, “Is the Tathāgata looking at me alone?”</s>
    <s id="15:2">They each thought, “I shall make my own offering of alms and so reap the exact result of offering alms to the guide of humans.”</s>
    <s id="15:3">It was not at all easy to fathom what occurred just from him passing by.#8</s>
  </p>
  <p id="16">
    <s id="16:1">$14 Then, the Bhagavān went out to receive alms, making his rounds through the town of Śrāvastī.</s>
    <s id="16:2">The Bhagavān reached a place near the center of town where a fine-figured, lovely, and attractive child had been left all alone inside a deserted dwelling.</s>
    <s id="16:3">The child was sitting there sucking on his right thumb.</s>
    <s id="16:4">A number of dogs, or jackals, had gathered inside the empty house [276.b] and were approaching the child and licking him.</s>
    <s id="16:5">However, due to his past virtues, these animals caused no harm to the young child.</s>
    <s id="16:6">Some of the townsfolk were also going in and out of the deserted building.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="17">
    <s id="17:1">$15 Seeing the townsfolk coming and going, the Bhagavān knowingly directed Venerable Ānanda,</s>
    <s id="17:2">“Ānanda, go and see what is inside that deserted house, the one all those townsfolk are entering and leaving.”</s>
    <s id="17:3">As he had been commanded by the Bhagavān,</s>
    <s id="17:4">Venerable Ānanda went to the deserted house, and upon arriving saw a fine-figured child, beautiful and lovely to behold,</s>
    <s id="17:5">sitting there sucking on his right thumb and staring openly at the crowd of people around him.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="18">
    <s id="18:1">$16 After seeing this, Venerable Ānanda returned to the Bhagavān and reported,</s>
    <s id="18:2">“Bhagavān, inside that deserted house is an abandoned child whose body is well formed, beautiful, and attractive, like a precious jewel.</s>
    <s id="18:3">He sits there gazing with wide eyes at all the people gathered around him.”</s>
  </p>
  <p id="19">
    <s id="19:1">$17 The Bhagavān thought, “Aha! This child, through his outstanding training in previous lives,</s>
    <s id="19:2">has the ability to understand the meaning of my teachings, and</s>
    <s id="19:3">so is most fortunate!”#9</s>
    <s id="19:4">Out of affection for that child, and in order to lead the common folk to virtue,#10 he went to the deserted dwelling.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="20">
    <s id="20:1">$18 When the Bhagavān reached the dwelling, he entered and</s>
    <s id="20:2">took a seat to the side of the child and then addressed the following verse to him:</s>

  <p id="21">
    <s id="21:1">“Frequented by snakes and yakṣas, This charnel ground is most frightening.</s>
    <s id="21:2">How could a child not be frightened here?And yet, here you are now, all alone!”#11</s>
  </p>
  <p id="22">
    <s id="22:1">$19 Through the power of the Buddha and as a result of his own prior roots of virtue, the child then responded to the Bhagavān with these verses:</s>
  </p>
  <p id="23">
    <s id="23:1">“Mighty Sage, who should feel fear Toward phenomena#12 that have no self-identity?</s>
    <s id="23:2">Omniscient One, supreme speaker, [277.a] Whatever the action through which I came to be here,</s>
