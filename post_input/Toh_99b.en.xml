  <p id="9">
    <s id="9:1">$5 So the householder master builder, doing what venerable Pūrṇa had advised,</s>

    <s id="9:3">In the sandalwood courtyard and the roof of the temple he placed flower decorations and sprinkled perfume.</s>
    <s id="9:4">He then faced in the direction where the Blessed One was dwelling, draped his shawl over one shoulder,</s>

    <s id="10:1">$6 In this way, the householder master builder earnestly invited the Blessed One.</s>

  </p>
  <p id="12">

  <p id="13">

    <s id="14:3">At that time the bamboo courtyard was filled with many monks who had assembled there, including venerable Ānanda.</s>
    <s id="14:4">The Blessed One then spoke to venerable Ānanda:</s>

  </p>
  <p id="15">
    <s id="15:1">$10 Venerable Ānanda obliged and, doing as the Blessed One had instructed,</s>

  </p>
  <p id="16">
    <s id="16:1">$11 So the Blessed One then went to the assembly hall, took his seat, and said to the monks,</s>
    <s id="16:2">“Monks, in the city of Transcending Virtue there is a householder master builder who has invited the Buddha and the congregation of monks.</s>
    <s id="16:3">I have accepted the invitation, so those monks among you who have miraculous abilities, please go now and fetch your ordination sticks.”</s>
    <s id="16:4">At that point there was a group of five hundred monks who picked up their ordination sticks.</s>
    <s id="16:5">The Buddha then spoke to them:</s>

  </p>
  <p id="17">
    <s id="17:1">“Blessed One, we will do that,” the monks replied, and</s>

  </p>
  <p id="18">
    <s id="18:1">$12 In the early morning when the night had passed, the Blessed One put on his lower garment, dressed in his Dharma robes, [113.a] and picked up his alms bowl.</s>
    <s id="18:2">He then rose up into the air above the grove of Prince Jeta and</s>
    <s id="18:3">flew toward the city of Transcending Virtue.</s>
    <s id="18:4">At that time in Rājagṛha there was a monk known as Valkalāyana, who lived in seclusion under a fig tree on the slopes of the Hill of Sages.</s>

    <s id="18:6">persevering in the practices related to the thirty-seven factors of awakening as well as the practices of tranquility and insight.</s>
    <s id="18:7">As he was there practicing, he saw the Blessed One and the congregation of hearers traveling through the sky, as if they were majestic swans.</s>
    <s id="18:8">Folding his hands in the direction of the Blessed One, he bowed down and prostrated to him.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="19">
    <s id="19:1">$13 The Blessed One then turned to venerable Valkalāyana and said,</s>
    <s id="19:2">“Valkalāyana, come with us!”</s>
    <s id="19:3">As soon as venerable Valkalāyana realized what the Blessed One was saying,</s>
    <s id="19:4">he jumped right off the cliff into the gorge without any consideration for life and limb.</s>
    <s id="19:5">As soon as he leaped into space, he obtained the six superknowledges.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="20">
    <s id="20:1">$14 At that point the Blessed One, Valkalāyana, and all five hundred worthy ones proceeded toward the city of Transcending Virtue.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="21">
    <s id="21:1">$15 Once there, the monks descended on the sandalwood courtyard and the temple in a display of various miraculous emanations.</s>
    <s id="21:2">Some took on the form of lions, some the form of tigers;</s>

    <s id="21:5">Some monks radiated blue lights, [113.b] while others radiated red, white, and purple lights from their bodies.</s>
    <s id="21:6">Some caused a rain to fall, others made the wind blow.</s>
    <s id="21:7">Some brought down a rain of gems, while others made it rain with gold, silver, and perfume.</s>
    <s id="21:8">Some brought a cool breeze, others carried the ground on their shoulders, while yet others brought clouds with oceans of water.</s>
    <s id="21:9">Some arrived in carriages, such as elephant carriages, horse carriages, nāga carriages, kumbhāṇḍa carriages, yakṣa carriages, and gandharva carriages.</s>
    <s id="21:10">Still others performed other miracles, such as letting fires blaze and water pour from their bodies.</s>
    <s id="21:11">It was amidst all of these miracles and many others that they descended upon the sandalwood courtyard and the temple.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="22">
    <s id="22:1">$16 The Blessed One assumed his own form adorned with the thirty-two marks and the eighty signs of a great being.</s>

    <s id="22:10">In this way the Blessed One along with his assembly of hearers caused all beings there to be overjoyed.</s>
    <s id="22:11">The brahmins and householders in Transcending Virtue [114.a] all saw the Blessed One and his assembly of hearers descending from the sky and</s>

    <s id="22:13">Seeing this,</s>
    <s id="22:14">tens of thousands of beings purified the eye of Dharma so that it became stainless and free of blemishes.</s>
    <s id="22:15">Tens of thousands of beings, who had practiced with previous blessed buddhas, engendered the mind of awakening upon seeing the miraculous manifestation of the Buddha.</s>
    <s id="22:16">As soon as they had engendered the mind of awakening, they developed acceptance that phenomena are unborn.</s>
    <s id="22:17">The thousands of beings who had not previously engendered the mind of awakening, now did so.</s>
    <s id="22:18">Upon seeing the miracles of the hearers, eighty thousand beings, who had previously been tamed by the hearers, now purified the eye of Dharma so that it became stainless and free of blemishes with regard to phenomena.</s>
    <s id="22:19">As the tens of thousands of gods witnessed the Blessed One’s miracles,</s>

  <p id="23">
    <s id="23:1">$17 Then Śakra, the lord of the gods, said to a gandharva prince known as Pañcaśikha,</s>
