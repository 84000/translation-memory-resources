    <s id="755:1">$554 As#233 the Blessed One was traveling through the province of Mallā, he stepped off the road that led to the Antavān River and to Kuśinagarī and said to Venerable Ānanda,</s>
    <s id="755:2">“Ānanda, make four folds in the Tathāgata’s upper garment, and lay it out.</s>
    <s id="755:3">I will rest my sore back awhile.”</s>

    <s id="756:1">Venerable Ānanda said, “As you please, Lord.”</s>

  <p id="757">
    <s id="757:1">$555 The Blessed One, seeing that his Dharma robes and patched raiment had been folded up and set out, sat himself down,</s>
    <s id="757:2">and then mindful, self-possessed, and with clear perception, he lay down on his right side, placing one leg upon the other.</s>
  </p>
  <p id="758">
    <s id="758:1">$556 The Blessed One thought, [120.a]</s>
    <s id="758:2">“Of all those ascetics here in the assembly who are ordinary persons, whom might the Buddha tame, and whom might his disciples tame?”</s>
    <s id="758:3">Then the Blessed One thought,</s>

    <s id="758:6">With this thought the Blessed One instructed Venerable Ānanda,</s>

  <p id="760">
    <s id="760:1">$558 Venerable Ānanda addressed the monks:</s>

  <p id="762">
    <s id="762:1">$560 After Venerable Ānanda [120.b] had set forth the limbs of enlightenment, he gave the monks the relevant Dharma teaching</s>
