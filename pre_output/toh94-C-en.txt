$998 This completes the account of the previous aspirations of the one thousand buddhas.#256
$999 At that time the Blessed One spoke these verses:
“Such is the ripening
Of small donations made to buddhas.
Given that the effects in saṃsāra are of this kind,
What knowledgeable person would not give rise to the mind of awakening?
$1000 “It may be possible to comprehend the extent of the sky,
And it may be possible to gradually measure the great ocean,
Yet it is hard to measure the merit
Of even slight faith in the buddhas.
$1001 “Until reaching the bliss of nirvāṇa,
One will not have to suffer the pains of inopportune states.
Therefore, when they have attained the victorious fields of merit,
Humans should honor and worship with care.
$1002 “When, deeply inspired by the buddhas,
One presents even small offerings before the relics
Of the well-gone ones who have attained nirvāṇa,
The extent of the associated qualities is impossible to grasp, so keep that in mind!
$1003 “Offerings to the victorious ones by means of the mind of awakening,
These four boundless Dharma teachings,
And the realms of space and of sentient beings
Can only be understood by the Teacher, and no one else.
$1004 “Compared to giving rise to and correctly abiding by the mind of awakening
In order to care for all sentient beings,
A poor person’s discovery of a treasure covering an entire league
Is not an occasion of happiness.
$1005 “The victorious ones’ eightfold reveling#257
For the sake of awakening, their ten powers,
The five hundred congregations of sentient beings, the four delights, [337.a]
The eighty thousand applications of realization,
$1006 “The eighty-four topics hard to comprehend,
The sixty thousand unsurpassable gateways,
The discernments of the grounds, the seventy-six forms of wisdom,
The eighteen modes of conduct that reveal the buddhas,
$1007 “The five subjugations of the beyond, the tenfold stability,
The eleven billion fields of activity,
The qualities of the buddhas,
Their marks and signs, and the modes of conduct—
$1008 “Since none of this is accessible even to solitary buddhas,
What need to speak of the hearers who follow the spoken word?
Unparalleled and incomparable,
Buddhahood is known to be inconceivable.
$1009 “Those intent on the highest awakening
Are not inferior, and their practice is unparalleled.
Discovering today the world’s great treasure,
They receive fine sustenance in the world.
$1010 “Conquering the māras and reaching the nectar,
They are satisfied by majestic rainclouds of beauty.
Entering awakening, those protectors of the world
Gather the seven riches.
$1011 “Bearing hundreds of pains,
Those entering awakening will never be weary.
Quickly attaining all these qualities,
They become the superiors of the entire world.
$1012 “Desires are the cause of numerous sufferings,
And as they ripen, beings fall into the lower realms.
As they proceed to the higher realms and accomplish the qualities of awakening,
What wise person would commit the breaches of the immature?
$1013 “Breaches are made by the immature, not by the wise.
Delusion belongs to the ignorant, while the well-informed achieve recollection.
Fools sink in swamps, while the wise reside on plains.
Those practicing the Dharma achieve acceptance.
$1014 “Therefore, give up the unreasonable
And adhere to facts and understanding.
Give up glory, fame, and riches,
And engage in the practice of this absorption.
$1015 “Given that recollecting even just a single quality of the buddhas [337.b]
Brings patient endurance of innumerable millennia of eons,
What need is there to mention the recollection of buddha qualities that are beyond the reach of thought?
Therefore, wholeheartedly accept suffering and misery,
$1016 “Don the armor of patience and absorption,
Raise the banner of diligence, and ride the chariot of discipline.
With the arrows of generosity, strength, and insight,
Defeat the māras and victoriously proceed to awakening.
$1017 “Always keeping to the friendship of love and practice,
Delight in the perfections,
Cherish the home of emptiness, enjoy the food of power,
And thus accomplish the qualities of omniscience.
$1018 “In this way, comprehend well the teaching that is delivered here
And apply yourselves to it with care.
Like geese crying with joy as they fly through the sky,
Move on quickly into the achievement of omniscience.”
$1019 “Prāmodyarāja, once in the past there was a thus-gone one by the name of Infinite Diligence, whose retinue numbered billions, and he taught this absorption. At that time there was a king known as Flower of Merit. The king heard that thus-gone one’s teaching and proceeded to speak as follows to his one thousand queens and one thousand sons: ‘I do not know the meaning of this exhaustive illumination of absorption. I do not know it, and I fail to understand. Nevertheless, we shall rejoice in these fine statements of the Thus-Gone One.’
$1020  “As the king thus rejoiced in that blessed one’s excellent statements and explanations on this meditative absorption, he cast aside eighty thousand eons of saṃsāra and looked beyond. He attained the recollection called heavenly bodies, and he indeed became free from doubt with respect to this teaching of awakening. By the roots of virtue ensuing from that, he went on to please three hundred thousand buddhas, and from each of them he received this absorption. Never again would he descend into error or inopportune states. [338.a] By this very cause, he accomplished perfect and complete buddhahood. He became perfectly and completely awakened.
$1021  “Prāmodyarāja, do not think that Flower of Merit, the king at that point and at that time, was someone else. At that point and at that time, the thus-gone Amitāyus was King Flower of Merit, and the thus-gone ones of this Good Eon were his one thousand sons. If simply rejoicing in this absorption has that much power, what can we say about reading this, receiving its scriptural transmission, and putting it into practice?
$1022  “Prāmodyarāja, once in the past there was a thus-gone one by the name of Nectar Joy whose retinue numbered hundreds of thousands. A universal monarch named Vast Mind offered that thus-gone one a palace shining with golden light, moistened by the sap of red sandalwood, and perfumed with the incense of myrobalan. For their enjoyment, he also offered each member of the saṅgha of monks the exact same gift. Moreover, he offered every one of them a pleasure garden. Thus, he came to hear this absorption from that blessed one.
$1023  “He then said to the best among the scholars attending that blessed one, someone by the name of Perfect Insight, ‘I must understand this absorption. But doing so is difficult as long as one remains in a household. I must by all means shave off my hair and beard, go forth from the household, and become a homeless mendicant. There can be no doubt about this.’ He then did shave off his hair and beard, don the saffron-colored robes, go forth from the household, and become a homeless mendicant. All his ten thousand sons and eighty-four thousand queens went forth at the same time, wishing to receive the various aspects of this absorption. [338.b] Knowing their thoughts, that blessed one proceeded to teach them this absorption in detail for a period of seven days. As they heard this teaching, they said to one another, ‘Alas, this absorption is difficult to behold. Nevertheless, we shall write this down carefully, and we shall uphold this.’
$1024 “Hence, they wrote down this absorption and made it their object of worship. They retained it and received its transmission. After they had passed away, they all came together again, and they pleased six hundred thousand buddhas. They kept hearing this absorption, and they all went forth and obtained this absorption. In accordance with their prayers and by these roots of virtue alone, they all attained awakening.
$1025 “Prāmodyarāja, do not think that, at that point and at that time, the universal monarch named Vast Mind was someone else. The thus-gone Dīpaṅkara was at that point and on that occasion the universal monarch known as Vast Mind, and the thus-gone Vilocana was the monk and attendant by the name of Perfect Insight. His ten thousand sons will remain unable to reach awakening for thirty-five eons, counting from the present one. Then will follow an eon called Great Renown, and during that single eon all of them will awaken to perfect and complete buddhahood. After the eon called Great Renown is over, the eighty thousand ministers will remain unable to reach awakening for eighty eons. Then will follow an eon called Star-Like, during which those eighty thousand ministers will awaken to perfect and complete buddhahood. [339.a] After the eon called Star-Like will follow three hundred eons during which no buddhas will appear. Then there will be an eon known as Array of Qualities, and during that time the eighty-four thousand queens will awaken to perfect and complete buddhahood. Prāmodyarāja, such are the fruits born by this absorption of the bodhisattvas.
$1026 “Prāmodyarāja, in this way the superior wishes of the bodhisattvas are fulfilled. Without regard for your own body or life, pursue this absorption. If you wish to awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, then you should adhere to the practice of this absorption.”
$1027 At that point the Blessed One spoke these verses:
“Those in pursuit of the buddhas’ awakening
Should train in the footsteps of those kings.
For, besides adhering to true practice,
There is no way to achieve supreme awakening.
$1028 “Even if one’s faith in this is weak,
The ripening achieved will be sublime.
Therefore, with unswerving, superior intent,
Engage in this spiritual practice with all manner of respect.
$1029 “Those who wish to see the victors
Of whom I have here spoken,
And who wish for extensive explanation,
Should, just as taught, take up this spiritual practice.
$1030 “Since merely rejoicing brings such excellence,
What need is there to mention the effects of holding and reading this?
No wandering being can conceive of the extent of these qualities.
Upon hearing this, who would not engage in this spiritual practice?
$1031 “Awakening, correct knowledge, distinctive features,
Teaching, inspiring the minds of others,
Practice, and illumination—all these buddha qualities
Should be pursued through this absorption.
$1032 “Purification of karma, defeating the māras,
Purifying beliefs, bringing existence to the point of exhaustion, [339.b]
Reveling, and the rich arrays of the pure fields—
None of these are rare for the one who is in possession of this.
$1033 “Likewise, liberation, perfect acumen,
Universal mastery of actions,
Bodies suited to one’s wishes, and awakening to buddhahood—
All of these are abundant for the one who abides by this.
$1034 “As I have spoken here of these matters in abundant words,
Do follow them up here and accomplish them!
Those who do not delight in the qualities of omniscience
Will surely have regrets in the future.
$1035 “The many perfections I have taught,
Along with the paths for reaching the ocean of wisdom,
Remain beyond the scope of comprehension
Of corporeal beings engaged in infantile conduct.
$1036 “In evil times when beings are wicked,
When the Dharma is about to disappear and the lower realms are looming,
The wise will feel deep remorse.
They will be cautious and timid, like deer.
$1037 “Prāmodyarāja, compared to the amount of merit accomplished by a bodhisattva who has practiced the six perfections with comprehensive skill throughout one thousand eons, the merit that arises when hearing about this absorption and rejoicing is far greater—beyond all comparison.”
$1038 When the Blessed One gave this Dharma teaching, innumerable bodhisattvas gave rise to the mind of unexcelled perfect and complete awakening, and they all irreversibly attained unexcelled perfect and complete awakening. Moreover, eight hundred thousand gods and humans attained the pure Dharma eye that beholds phenomena immaculately and without stain. Since the eyes of those gods were now pure, they delighted in the Blessed One’s Dharma and scattered flowers throughout this trichiliocosm. [340.a] The trichiliocosm shook in six distinctive ways, and the sounds of divine drums filled the air. Prāmodyarāja, along with all the millions of other bodhisattvas, attained this meditative absorption.
$1039 When the Blessed One had said these words, Prāmodyarāja and all the other bodhisattva great beings—as well as the whole world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas—rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One.
$1040 This completes the noble sūtra of the Great Vehicle, known as “The Good Eon.”
