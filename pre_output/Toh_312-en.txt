The Noble Mahāsūtra
Entering the City of Vaiśālī
$1 [157.b] Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas!
Thus did I hear at one time: The Blessed One was residing in Nāḍikā, at the Impenetrable Dwelling Place.#26 The Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us proceed to the city of Vaiśālī.”
“Let us do so, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda, assenting to what the Blessed One had said.
Thereupon the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, arrived in Vaiśālī. In Vaiśālī, he stayed in Āmrapālī’s grove.
$2 At that time the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, go to the city of Vaiśālī, place your foot on the threshold of the city gate, and utter these mantras [158.a] and these verses:
“ ‘ Visarata visarata visarata visarata#27
$3 “ ‘The Buddha, who has compassion for the world, has spoken.#28 This is the wish of all buddhas. It is the wish of all pratyekabuddhas. It is the wish of all arhats. It is the wish of all those undergoing training. It is the wish of all śrāvakas. It is the wish of all who speak words of truth. It is the wish of the Dharma.#29 It is the wish of Kāmeśvara. It is the wish of Brahmā. It is the wish of Pratyeka­brahman. It is the wish of Indra. It is the wish of the gods. It is the wish of the lord of the demigods. It is the wish of all demigods. It is the wish of the servants of the demigods. It is the wish of all bhūtas:
“ ‘ Visarata visarata visarata visarata#30
$4 “ ‘The Buddha, who has compassion for the world, has spoken.
“ ‘ Muñcata muñcata#31
$5 “ ‘Do not stay. The epidemic should cease.
“ ‘ Nirgacchata nirgacchata nirgacchata nirgacchata#32
$6 “ ‘The Buddha, the Great God, the God of Gods, the Supreme God, has arrived. The gods including Indra, the gods including Brahmā, the gods including Īśāna, the gods including Prajāpati, and the Four Protectors of the World have come. Hundreds of thousands of gods, lords of the demigods, and hundreds of thousands of demigods have also come. Hundreds of thousands of bhūtas who have faith in the Blessed One have also come for the sake of all living beings, and they have come to bring great harm to you; so:
“ ‘ Nirgacchata nirgacchata nirgacchata nirgacchata
$7 “ ‘Disperse quickly. Those of you who have hateful thoughts, may you be destroyed. Those who have loving thoughts, who do not wish to sin but wish to protect beings, [158.b] stay and take on physical form.#33 The Buddha, who has compassion for the world, has spoken.
“ ‘ Sumu sumu | sumu sumu sumu | sumuru sumuru | sumuru sumuru | sumuru sumuru | sumuru sumuru | muru muru | muru muru | muru muru | muru muru | miri miri | miri miri | miri miri miri | murumiri murumiri | murumiri murumiri | murumiri murumiri | murumiri murumiri | murumiri murumiri | murumiri murumiri | murumiri murūrīti | riri riri riri | rīrī rīrī rīrīti | miri miri miriti | hisi miri miriti | mirisi sīsīmī | kaṅkarā karakata | kaṅkarā karakacā | kaṅkarā kaṅkarā | kaṅkarā kaṅkarā | kaṅkarā kaṅkarā | kaṅkarā kaṅkarā | kaṅkarā kaṅkarā | kaṅkarā kaṅkarā | kaṅkarā kaṅkarā | kaṅkaro titi kuriśo | kaṅkara kaṅkariśi | ririri ririri | hiritaphu svā | ripu ripu | ripu ripu | ripu ripu | ripu ripu | nāthā nānā | thā thā | ripu ripu | nāthātha | nirgacchata nirgacchata | ripu ripu | nirgacchata palāyāta | ripū ripū pālāyata |#34

“ ‘ Kṣipraṃ nirgacchata#35 svāhā
$9 “These mantras, which were proclaimed to all the gods and all the bhūtas through the Buddha’s supreme wisdom and truth, will accomplish their purpose. The following verses#36 will accomplish their purpose:

$21 “ ‘May the Buddha bring you well-being; May Śakra and the gods bestow well-being; And may well-being from the bhūtas, too, Be provided to you always.
$22 “ ‘By the Buddha’s merit and power And the wishes of the gods, May whatever goal you seek This very day be accomplished.
$23 “ ‘Two-legged beings, be well. Four-legged beings, be well. When you set out, be well; And when you return, be well.
$24 “ ‘Be well in the daytime; be well in the night; Be well at midday, too. May all of you be always well; [159.b] May all of you know no evil.#40
$25 “ ‘Surrounded by a thousand gods, The Buddha has arrived— So, you with hateful thoughts, disperse! And you whose nature is compassion, stay.
$26 “ ‘By the power of the true words of the buddhas, Pratyekabuddhas, arhats, and those being trained, Those who do harm to the world Should be gone from this city.#41
$27 “ ‘All sentient beings, all living creatures, All bhūtas, and every one of you— May you have nothing but happiness. May you all be free from illness. May you all see what is good. May all of you know no evil.#42
$28 “ ‘May whatever bhūtas are assembled here, All those who live upon the earth or in the sky, Act always lovingly for human beings And practice Dharma day and night.’ ”#43
