The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra:
Avalokinī
The Translation
$1 [251.a] Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!
$2 Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing in Rājagṛha at Vulture Peak Mountain, together with a great saṅgha of monks and a great many bodhisattva great beings.
$3 At that time, the Blessed One said to the [251.b] bodhisattva Pure Intellect, “Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their discipline is pure. Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their absorption, patience, and beneficence are pure. Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their love is pure. Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their compassion is pure. Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their joy and equanimity are pure. Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their liberation and their liberated wisdom are pure. Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their powers are pure. Pure Intellect, the thus-gone ones are pure because their fearlessness, buddha qualities, and omniscient wisdom are pure.
$4 “Pure Intellect, this being so, the size of the mass of merit generated by someone who honors the pure thus-gone ones with flowers, garlands, perfumes, parasols, banners, flags, music, and ointments cannot be fathomed. Except for the final passing into nirvāṇa through any of the three vehicles, this heap of merit can never be depleted, even in the future. Why is that so? Pure Intellect, just as the thus-gone ones are immeasurable in terms of all their buddha qualities, the offerings made to the thus-gone ones are immeasurable, endless, [252.a] inconceivable, incomparable, unfathomable, incalculable, boundless, and inexpressible.
$5 “Pure Intellect, consider someone who honors, respects, venerates, worships, and reveres the thus-gone ones who live, thrive, and are well today. Then, consider someone who, in the future, during the final five-hundred-year period, honors, respects, venerates, worships, reveres, and holds dear a relic belonging to a thus-gone one who has passed into parinirvāṇa, even if it is as small as a mustard seed. Giving rise to the mind set on awakening, that person will pay homage to, prostrate to, honor, respect, venerate, worship, revere, supplicate, praise, and circumambulate this relic. Both of these persons will gain five benefits. What are these five benefits? They will be endowed with (1) mindfulness, (2) understanding, and (3) self-respect and propriety; (4) they will quickly meet a blessed buddha; and (5) faith will be born in them upon seeing that buddha. These are the five benefits that they will gain.
$6 “Those persons will also possess four other qualities. What are these four qualities? (1) They will uphold the teachings of the thus-gone ones, (2) they will practice in accordance with these teachings, (3) they will come near to the blessed buddhas after having practiced in that way, and (4) they will swiftly be born in a pure buddhafield. These are the four qualities.
$7 “Pure Intellect, if a bodhisattva fulfills four criteria, he or she will not be oppressed by Māra or any divine sons of Māra’s family. What are these four criteria? (1) Being born in a high and noble family, (2) directing one’s mind toward the blessed buddhas as soon as one is born, (3) upholding the sacred Dharma in later stages of life, and (4) always being blessed by the thus-gone ones, [252.b] the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas. Pure Intellect, if a bodhisattva fulfills these four criteria, they will not be oppressed by Māra or any divine sons of Māra’s family.”
$8 At that moment, the Blessed One uttered these verses:
$9 “Whoever arouses the mind set on awakening,
For the benefit of all beings,
And circumambulates the stūpa
Of a protector of the world,
$10 “Will, throughout all his lives,
Be mindful, intelligent,
Meritorious, and fearless
While engaging in bodhisattva conduct.
$11 “If someone circumambulates a stūpa,
He#8 will, throughout all his lives,
Be worshiped by the gods,
The nāgas, the yakṣas, and the rākṣasas.
$12 “He will be free from the eight unfree states
That I have described,
And will enjoy a unique freedom—
The excellent circumstance of a buddha’s coming.
$13 “With a beautiful complexion and an attractive appearance,
Elegantly adorned with the marks,
He will be strong and powerful,
And will not fall under the influence of laziness.
$14 “He will be wealthy, prosperous,
Meritorious, and invincible.
He will please the lights of the world,
And honor them again and again.
$15 “Upon hearing the doctrines of selflessness and emptiness,
He will not be deluded about the Dharma,
But will swiftly develop faith,
And correctly master the Dharma’s meaning.
$16 “Born into prosperous
And wealthy merchant households,
He will be a heroic benefactor,
Generous and free from greed.
$17 “Anywhere in the world,
This upstanding person will always be born
In distinguished and noble families,
Having escaped inferior circumstances.
$18 “If someone circumambulates a stūpa,
He will, throughout all his lives,
Be reborn as an influential, renowned,
Illustrious, and splendid householder. [253.a]
$19 “He will become a great Brahmin householder,
Who is disciplined and learned.
He will become a great Kṣatriya householder,
Who is wealthy and affluent.
$20 “He will become a righteous king,
A sovereign of the four continents,
Who rules the entire land according to his wishes,
As far as the ocean and the surrounding mountains.
$21 “He will become a universal monarch possessing miraculous powers
And the seven precious things.
Ruling over his kingdom,
He will honor the buddhas again and again.
$22 “After he dies and transfers, he will proceed to the higher realms,
Where he will have faith in the Buddha’s teachings.
He will become Śakra, lord of the gods,
Ruling from the summit of Mount Meru.
$23 “He will become the lord of the gods of the Heaven Free from Strife,
The lord of the gods of the Heaven of Joy,
And the lord of the gods of the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations.
He will be a fearless ruler.
$24 “By circumambulating a stūpa,
He will become the wise lord Brahmā,
Who is worshiped by ten million gods
In the Brahmā world.
$25 “Ten million eons would not suffice
To proclaim the praises
Of a person who circumambulates
The stūpa of a protector of the world.
$26 “Whoever prostrates to the stūpa of a teacher,
After having given rise to the mind set on awakening,
Will never, in ten million eons,
Become blind or crippled.
$27 “Someone who circumambulates
The stūpa of a protector of the world
Will obtain flawless eyes,
That are as beautifully dark as bees.
$28 “If someone circumambulates a stūpa,
He is certain to always
Encounter everything that is conducive,
And to always discard what is not conducive.
$29 “If someone circumambulates a stūpa,
He will be strong and powerful.
Without falling under the influence of laziness,
He will always be conscientious.
$30 “If someone circumambulates a stūpa,
He will be resolutely diligent, strong,
Staunch, and grounded.
Such a person will swiftly become learned.
$31 “Fire, poison, and weapons
Will never cause his demise. [253.b]
This wise one will only die
When his lifespan is exhausted.
$32 “If someone circumambulates a stūpa,
He will enjoy palaces, retinues,
Lands, and towns,
And be distinguished by his physical appearance.
$33 “As he engages in bodhisattva conduct,
He will not follow his desires,
But will maintain the cleanliness of his body and clothes,
And observe the pure Dharma.
$34 “Pure Intellect, upon seeing the stūpa of a thus-gone one, a follower of the bodhisattva vehicle may develop faith and, kneeling on both knees, pay homage and prostrate to it. Moreover, he may arouse devotion, thinking, ‘May my body become just like the bodies of the thus-gone ones, which are adorned with the thirty-two marks of a great being!’ Pure Intellect, in that case, the size of that heap of merit will be indescribable, because it is based on unsurpassed and perfect awakening. That heap of merit cannot be exhausted by becoming a king, Śakra, Brahmā, a solitary buddha, or even a practitioner of the unsurpassed vehicle of the perfect buddhas. Why is that so? Because, Pure Intellect, such a noble son is in possession of an inconceivable heap of merit. Pure Intellect, consider the Thus-Gone One who has awakened to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. Whenever he is entering a city, a monastery, or a village, and whether he is walking, standing, sitting, or teaching the Dharma, all beings without exception in this great trichiliocosm—gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, [254.a] and nonhumans—will bow, salute, and prostrate in his direction. Even the trees, mountains, mines, caves, and rock shelters will do so. Just as they all behave toward the Thus-Gone One, who is endowed with all roots of virtue, so sentient beings will also bow, salute, and prostrate to such noble sons as they wander in villages, cities, towns, lands, or capitals.”
$35 At that moment, the Blessed One uttered these verses:
$36 “When someone kneels before the stūpa of a buddha,
Forms the wish to be like the buddhas in the world,
And is firmly intent on awakening,
The three worlds will bow to him, wherever he goes.
$37 “Wherever that self-arisen chief of humans goes,
All the grass, trees, branches,
Herbs, leaves, fruits, flower petals,
And fragrant flowers will bow in that direction.
$38 “All the rulers of humans will bow down
To the person who kneels before the stūpas of the blessed ones.
The lord of the yakṣas, the king of the nāgas, the king of the gods,
And the lord Brahmā will all bow at his feet.
$39 “If someone kneels and prostrates before the stūpas of the blessed ones,
He will become a heroic and powerful universal monarch,
Adorned with a golden complexion and wearing the armor of the marks.
His great might will be respected and hard to overcome.
$40 “All the sentient beings residing in his lands
Will be kind and joyful,
And no one will commit any evil deed toward him.
Those great assemblies of beings will be joyful and charming.
$41 “A world ruler will salute [254.b]
Someone who kneels and pays homage to the stūpas of the blessed ones.
The gods, nāgas, humans, and mahoragas will bow down to him,
And he will find relief for limitless eons.
$42 “When the sublime victorious ones appear,
The person who kneels and pays homage to the stūpas of the blessed ones
Will come in close contact with these thus-gone ones,
And will worship countless such great leaders.
$43 “When myriads of eons have passed,
The person who kneels and pays homage to the stūpas of the blessed ones,
With the wish to become a buddha in the world,
Will swiftly reach the unequalled state of awakening.
$44 “Compared to someone who honors myriads of buddhas
For countless millions of eons,
Someone who, in the terrible future age of this eon,
Pays homage to a stūpa will accrue much more merit.
$45 “The sublime buddhas are unequalled objects of generosity,
Who reached unique attainments by engaging in sacred conduct.
If someone worships these foremost of humans,
He will develop an unequalled, sublime nature when these actions ripen.
$46 “Whoever makes flower garlands
And offers them to stūpas,
While directing his mind toward awakening,
Will never become destitute.
$47 “After his death, upon leaving the human realm,
He will be reborn in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three,
Where he will receive a palace
Made of all kinds of precious gems.
$48 “If someone offers a garland to a stūpa,
He will enjoy the pleasures of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three,
Where he will live in divine mansions and pavilions,
Attended by celestial maidens.
$49 “He will enjoy divine pools
Made of beryl and crystal,
Filled with water having the eight qualities,
And spread with golden sand.
$50 “After enjoying his time among the gods,
When his lifespan is exhausted,
This wise man will depart from the gods’ realm,
And be reborn as a prosperous man.
$51 “Through those roots of virtue,
This wise man will act conscientiously.
He will please the thus-gone ones, [255.a]
And worship these supreme ones among humans.
$52 “Whoever offers a garland to a stūpa
Will never be carried away
By desire or anger,
Nor will he become deluded.
$53 “Whoever worships the supreme ones among humans
Will, throughout all his lives,
Keep his senses under control,
And be free from attachment, aversion, and craving.
$54 “Whoever offers a garland to a stūpa
Will always be respected,
For lives numbered in 
The billions and trillions.
$55 “Whoever offers a garland to a stūpa
Will become a universal monarch,
Śakra, lord of the gods,
And Brahmā, ruling over the Brahmā world.
$56 “Having offered silken brocades
To the protectors and refuges of the world,
All his divine and human goals
Will be accomplished.
$57 “He will never again be reborn
In inferior families.
He will be rich and prosperous,
And will become a powerful lord of the world.
$58 “If someone worships the thus-gone ones,
He will have a perfect physical appearance,
His goals will be accomplished, and he will possess
Enjoyments, good looks, wealth, and fame.
$59 “Throughout all his lives, he will be mindful,
And will never be carried away by attachment.
Understanding the shortcomings of lust,
He will engage in pure conduct.
$60 “Whoever worships the thus-gone ones
Will not be affected
By forms, sounds, or tastes,
And will not engage in negative actions.
$61 “Whoever worships the guides
Will never be short of perfumes and flowers,
And will be endowed
With mindfulness and insight.
$62 “Whoever worships the thus-gone ones
Will never have his wealth touched
By kings, thieves,
Fire, or water.
$63 “Whoever offers silken brocades [255.b]
To the stūpa of a protector of the world
Will never encounter drought,
Sorrow, or sickness.
$64 “Whoever worships the lights of the world
Will, throughout all his lives,
Be free from sorrow and harm,
And will become a wealthy universal monarch.
$65 “Whoever worships the guides
Will have flexible legs and arms;
He will have flawless limbs,
Good looks, and a beautiful appearance.
$66 “Having abandoned negative actions,
He will engage in bodhisattva conduct,
And will meet the supreme ones among humans,
Who are so rare to find in the world.
$67 “For billions and trillions of eons,
He will worship,
Be happy and wise,
And awaken to sublime buddhahood.
$68 “Whoever builds a house with garlands
For the protectors and refuges of the world
Will become a wealthy king,
Never separated from his servants and attendants.
$69 “He will abandon the negative actions
That have been abandoned by the noble ones,
And rely on the virtuous actions
Prescribed by the perfect buddhas.
$70 “He will be loved, cherished,
Honored, and praised
By the gods, nāgas,
And wise ones in the world.
$71 “Wherever this steadfast one is born,
The brilliance of his merit will be resplendent.
His land, city,
And family will all honor him.
$72 “Whoever worships the unassailable buddhas,
The supreme ones among humans,
Will be strong and powerful,
And will enjoy a great retinue of servants.
$73 “Whoever builds a monastery with garlands
And dedicates it to awakening
Will obtain thereby the riches
Praised by the buddhas.
$74 “He will not be crippled or blind,
Or inferior or base.
Wherever that person is born,
His body will be adorned with the marks.
$75 “Upon seeing destitute beings, [256.a]
He will attract them with his wealth.
He will be affluent
And engage in bodhisattva conduct.
$76 “Through his great intelligence,
He will never adopt an inferior attitude
Nor will he become destitute,
Even after giving away the entire earth.
$77 “Whoever has entered the path of awakening
Will not be saddened 
By giving away his sons or daughters,
Or his virtuous and noble wife.
$78 “He will walk in front of others,
And delight those who lack guidance.
But he will never be harmed
By envy or pride.
$79 “Whoever has entered the path of awakening
Will be free from envy and gentle.
He will perfect patience,
Be helpful, and possess excellent qualities.
$80 “Those who have entered the path of awakening
Are the most precious beings in the world.
Such beings, who only rarely appear,
Are faultless objects of generosity.
$81 “The particles of earth
Could gradually be counted and assessed,
But the extent of such beings’ qualities
Cannot be expressed in words.
$82 “The minds of all sentient beings
In the three times could be known.
But the extent of such beings’ qualities
Cannot be expressed in words.
$83 “The four great oceans
Could eventually be depleted
With a billionth part of a strand of hair,
But such beings’ qualities can never be depleted.
$84 “One could count all the smallest particles of dust
Created by grinding the entire earth into powder,
But the extent of the qualities
Of these children of the buddhas cannot be expressed.
$85 “It is possible for all the raging rivers
To reverse course and flow upstream,
But it is not possible to express the extent
Of the qualities of these children of the buddhas.
$86 “All the former bodies
Of all the sentient beings who have ever lived
Could be counted and assessed,
But there is no end to the qualities of these beings.
$87 “Even all the hairs that ever grew
On all their former bodies [256.b]
Could be counted and assessed,
But there is no end to the qualities of these beings.
$88 “The hairs of all sentient beings who
Circle in the five classes of beings
Could be counted and assessed,
But there is no end to the qualities of these beings.
$89 “All the particles of earth
Present in the oceans
Could also be counted and assessed,
But the qualities of these beings cannot be expressed.
$90 “Starting from the time of Dīpaṃkara,
And for all the subsequent eons,
One could know exhaustively
All the fruits and flowers
$91 “Present on all the trees
That will ever grow.
Yet the extent of the qualities
Of these children of the buddhas cannot be expressed.
$92 “They cannot be expressed,
Even if a diligent person were
To sing them pleasing songs of praise
For billions or trillions of eons.
$93 “Whoever displeases
These children of the buddhas
Will depart the divine and human abodes,
And find themselves in the realms of hell.
$94 “Whoever harms
These bodhisattvas
Will be born blind or without eyes,
And will find no supportive friends when he suffers.
$95 “After dying, he will go to the Hell of Ceaseless Torment,
Where he will be burned and terrified.
He will also experience suffering
When his body grows in size.
$96 “Throughout his lives,
His body, which will remain a league in size,
And be round like a curd ball,#9
Will be eaten from all sides.
$97 “At that time, his body will have
Five thousand heads,
And each of these heads
Will have five hundred tongues.
$98 “Each of these tongues will be plowed
By hundreds of plowshares.
Due to the ripening of his evil actions,
His tongues will be slashed in unbearable ways.
$99 “After he dies and transfers from the Hell of Ceaseless Torment,
This evil-minded person will then experience
The Hot and Fiercely Hot hells,
As a result of his previous wrongdoings. [257.a]
$100 “It is not rare for an unrestrained person
Who harms bodhisattvas
To be reborn in the animal realm,
Or in the hell realms.
$101 “For billions and
Trillions of lives,
Such people experience suffering,
And never encounter anything good.
$102 “Whoever harms the children of the buddhas,
Who are the protectors,
Will be reborn as a water serpent—
Vicious and poisonous.
$103 “Tormented by hunger and thirst,
He will engage in evil deeds.
Deprived of food,
He will never feel satiated.
$104 “After he dies and transmigrates, he will be continuously crushed
And beaten in the world of the Lord of Death.
Because he has harmed monks,
He will never find any opportunity.
$105 “Then, after he dies and transmigrates,
If he obtains a human body,
This evil-minded person will be blind,
Malicious, and unrestrained.
$106 “Because he has deprecated the noble ones
Using abusive words,
After he dies, upon leaving the human realm,
He will swiftly be reborn in the lower realms.
$107 “An unrestrained person
Who harms bodhisattvas
Will not meet any buddha
For billions of eons.
$108 “Whoever protects the children of the perfect buddhas,
In accordance with the Dharma,
Will abandon all of the lower realms
And swiftly proceed to the higher realms.
$109 “He will be wealthy, prosperous,
Powerful, fearless,
Mindful, wise,
Happy, and endowed with self-respect and propriety.
$110 “Upon seeing the stūpa of a buddha,
Where a lamp of the worlds
Has passed into parinirvāṇa,
He will honor it again and again.
$111 “When hearing a Dharma discourse such as this
Spoken by the perfect buddhas,
Who would not develop faith
In the children of the buddhas?
$112 “One may venerate [257.b]
Myriads of buddhas
For as many eons as there are grains of sand
In the Ganges river.
$113 “Yet, upholding the sacred Dharma, day and night,
As it was revealed by the protectors of the world,
When it is about to disappear,
Will accumulate much more merit.
$114 “Whoever upholds the Dharma
When it is about to disappear
Will be worshiping me and all past buddhas,
Who abide in awakened wisdom.
$115 “Whoever protects the doctrine of the Teacher
When the sacred Dharma is about to disappear
Will never be troubled
For billions of eons.
$116 “Such a person will find physical well-being
And will never be struck by illness.
Nor will he be thwarted
By unpleasant circumstances.
$117 “Whoever protects the doctrine of the Teacher
Will have perfect patience.
He will be gentle, wise, and mild,
And will be affectionate toward sentient beings.
$118 “Upholding the Dharma of the supreme Victor in a time of decline,
One will be happy and joyful, and one’s fortune will increase.
One will reap the fruits of previous acts of veneration,
And will abandon the eight unfree states entirely.
$119 “Upholding the Dharma of the supreme Victor in a time of decline,
One will, just like the sky filled with stars,
Always be adorned with the armor of the marks,
And always speak pleasantly in a delightful voice.

One will abandon birth in lowly castes
Bereft of pleasure and filled with misery.
Instead, one will be rich, happy, and fortunate.

One will be powerful, strong, and diligent.

Venerating hundreds of thousands of buddhas.

One will be born with a supremely attractive physical appearance.
One will be wise and supremely venerated in the human world,
Praised by kings, the learned, and the wise. [258.a]
$123 “Upholding the Dharma of the supreme Victor in a time of decline,
One will obtain a supremely beautiful and attractive appearance,
And one will please and delight men, women, and gods.
One will be praised by the wise and endowed with insight.
$124 “The person who is present before the Teacher—
The god of gods, endowed with the ten powers—
As he expounds this sūtra
Will, in the future, receive sūtras such as this directly.
$125 “Please listen as I now describe all the unique qualities
That result from depicting the Teacher, the supreme human being,
By painting his image on a cloth or the surface of a wall,
Or by producing golden statues.
$126 “A person who engages in such practices will not be born blind,
Crooked, or with abnormal limbs.
Blessed with an attractive appearance and good looks,
He will possess the armor of the thirty-two marks.
$127 “He will be born with a perfect and preeminent body;
He will be self-confident and speak with a pleasant voice.
He will be attentive and will become the leader of the entire world.
Upon seeing him, others will be happy and joyful.

He will be intelligent, wealthy, prosperous,
And will become a powerful king, a universal monarch.
$130 “Whoever creates a beautiful image of the Guide
Will obtain the power of the mighty lord of gods.
He will become Śakra, ruling on the summit of Mount Meru.
This lord will display his dominion on that summit.
$131 “Mindful and intelligent,
His understanding, dedication, and insight will be complete,
And he will find relief in all the worlds.
This being will be endowed with wisdom and will abandon the hells.
$132 “Whoever worships the peerless quintessential being
Will not be reborn as an animal or in the domain of the Lord of Death.
Abandoning the three lower realms, [258.b]
He will know that he shall not take birth in them again.
$133 “Whoever creates a beautiful image of the Guide
Will become a god, the powerful Īśvara himself.
He will worship the buddhas with a mind of superior joy,
And will have faith in the teachings of the supreme victorious ones.
$134 “He will become Brahmā, ruling over the Brahmā world,
Where he will enjoy the most exquisite celestial palaces,
Which are delightful, sweet-scented,
And shining with gold from the Jambū river.
$135 “He will attain the level of the peerless quintessential being,
A captain endowed with the ten powers.
His infinite radiance will shine throughout all the worlds,
Like a thousand gold pieces or beryl gemstones.
$136 “Whoever picks flowers with a joyful mind
And faithfully showers them on a protector of the world
Will be meritorious in the human world,
Where, residing in his kingdom, he will venerate the supreme victors.
$137 “Even someone who is miserable, skinny, rigid, and smelly
Will come to possess a healthy and unmatched body.
Then, fit to be regarded by many beings, he will abandon desire—
The fundamental enemy that leads to the hells.
$138 “In practicing the conduct, he will know
That desire is loathesome, like a pit of vomit.
Then, with a joyful mind he will always engage
In the most superior and virtuous pure conduct.
$139 “For infinite eons, the sweet fragrance of beautiful lotus flowers
Will waft from his mouth.
His body will have the color of gold
And carry the fragrance of sandalwood.
$140 “While practicing the conduct, he will not be harmed
By wrath, rage, impurity, faults, or ignorance.
With a superior mind, he will find relief
And become a conscientious king of the gods.
$141 “When victorious ones pass into nirvāṇa,
He will respectfully uphold their Dharma.
With a superior and joyful mind, he will be generous,
And will worship the relics of those blessed ones who have passed into nirvāṇa. [259.a]
$142 “When the doctrine of the supreme victor is about to disappear,
He will joyfully uphold the Teacher’s religious precepts.
By engaging in the deeds of the supreme Dharma,
He will never face death through harmful factors.
$143 “If all beings became buddhas,
Free from afflictions, golden, and with the ten powers,
They would be able to express worshipful praise 
To that supreme victor for billions and trillions of eons.#10
$144 “He will abandon evil deeds in all the worlds,
And engage in supreme actions with a joyful mind.
Having worked properly and with great strength for the benefit of beings,
He will become a powerful and perfect buddha in the world.
$145 “I will now expound the benefits that result
From sprinkling the stūpas of the blessed ones with perfume,
Even as little as a drop the size of a mustard seed;
So listen sincerely and abandon your stains and defilements!

While practicing the conduct, he will subdue misery,
And he will cause many beings to become happy and pleased.

‘Please expound the extraordinary Dharma teachings
Of the supreme victors and clear away our doubts!’
Hearing the Dharma, they will be pleased and pass it on.
$150 “Not committing any evil deeds, he will be open-minded.
He will delight in and become learned concerning
The extraordinary, sublime Dharma taught by the victors.
His vision will be purified, and he will clear away the darkness of ignorance.
$151 “He will have only minimal attachment and aversion;
In the human world, his ignorance will not be great.
He will practice the supreme pure conduct, [259.b]
And accomplish the benefit of beings in ways that cannot be fathomed.
$152 “Whoever burns incense at the stūpas of the blessed ones
Will be free from all malice.
His enjoyments will never decrease,
And he will be estimable and affluent.
$153 “After his mind has been purified for billions and trillions of eons,
And has become free from evil, peaceful, calm, and gentle,
He will obtain unequalled awakening
