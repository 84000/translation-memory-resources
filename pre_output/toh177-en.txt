Mañjuśrī’s Teaching
$1 [240.a] Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!#9
Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park, the Jeta Grove in Śrāvastī, together with a great congregation of 1,250 monks and five thousand bodhisattvas.
$2 At that time, the Blessed One was teaching the Dharma surrounded and venerated by an audience of many hundreds of thousands. Youthful Mañjuśrī then hoisted a jeweled parasol measuring ten yojanas in circumference and held it directly over the Blessed One’s head.
$3 Present in the retinue, along with his entourage, was a god from the house of Santuṣita called Susīma,#10 whose progress toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening had become irreversible. He now rose from his seat, approached the place where Youthful Mañjuśrī was, and addressed him: “Mañjuśrī, aren’t you satisfied with your offering to the Blessed One?”
$4 Mañjuśrī asked in return, “Divine being, tell me, is the great ocean ever satisfied by having water poured into it?”
“Mañjuśrī, no, it is not,” replied the god.
$5 Mañjuśrī said, “Divine being, likewise, the wisdom of omniscience is as profound, immeasurable, and boundless#11 as the great ocean. Those bodhisattva mahāsattvas who wish to search for that wisdom should never#12 be content in their desire to make offerings to the Tathāgata.”
$6 The god then asked, “Mañjuśrī, with what purpose in mind should offerings be made to the Tathāgata?” [240.b]
Mañjuśrī replied, “Divine being, offerings should be made to the Tathāgata with four purposes in mind. What are those four? They are (1) the purpose of the mind of awakening,#13 (2) the purpose of liberating all sentient beings, (3) the purpose that the lineage of the Three Jewels will continue uninterrupted, and (4) the purpose of purifying all buddha realms.#14 Divine being, it is with these four purposes in mind that offerings should be made to the Tathāgata.”
$7 When Mañjuśrī had spoken, the god Susīma, the monks, nuns,#15 bodhisattvas, and the entire retinue, along with the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas, rejoiced and praised the words of Youthful Mañjuśrī.#16
$8 This concludes the noble Great Vehicle sūtra, “Mañjuśrī’s Teaching.”
