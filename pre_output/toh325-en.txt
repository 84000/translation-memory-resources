$3 Once, when the perfect Buddha, the god of gods, The Thus-Gone One, was still alive, Some monks sought to get the better of each other, Through rhetoric and other means.
$4 The Great Sage overheard The negative words uttered by the monks. So the Sage summoned the saṅgha And told everyone,
$5 “You inflict harm on one another By rhetoric and other means. Such actions are not suitable For those who have gone forth from home to homelessness.
$6 “Engage in six practices That are sure to always bring joy. These are suitable For those who have gone forth from home to homelessness.
$7 “Monks, hear from me How I cultivated nonviolence And strove for awakening, Out of compassion for all beings.

$9 “Once, there were two nāga kings Who were brothers. [205.a] The first was called Drum, And the second, Tambour.

$16 “Hearing abuse from someone as lowly as he, Tambour grew enraged. To his elder brother Drum, He explained the things he had heard.

$18 “ ‘He harms both the animals who live in water And the humans who live on land. O Lord, though I may possess patience, My mind cannot tolerate such abusive words.
$19 “ ‘Let us now lay waste to his city, His palace, and his relatives and attendants. Having overthrown Drumbeat, Let us then take leave of this place.’

$100 The Blessed Thus-Gone One Knows the realities of all former lives. Therefore, the Sage now turned to the monks And spoke these words:
$101 “In the past, I was Drum, Ānanda was Tambour, and Devadatta was Drumbeat. Remember our past lives in this fashion.”
