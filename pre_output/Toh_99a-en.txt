The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra
The Precious Discourse on the Blessed One’s Extensive Wisdom That Leads to Infinite Certainty
$1 [1.b] Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!
$2 Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was staying in Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park at Śrāvastī, along with a great saṅgha of 1,250 monks. At that time, in the city of Transcending Virtue#21 there was a householder, a master builder,#22 who had engaged venerable Pūrṇa to oversee the construction of a temple with a sandalwood courtyard exclusively dedicated to the Blessed One, exclusively with the Blessed One in mind, and exclusively for the sake of the Blessed One. Subsequently, that temple with its sandalwood courtyard [2.a] had been constructed and completed without delay.
$3 At that point, the householder master builder said to venerable Pūrṇa, “Pūrṇa, although this temple has been made exclusively for the Blessed One, exclusively with the Blessed One in mind, and exclusively for the sake of the Blessed One, we should also let others use it. In that way this gift of mine will have a greater effect and my efforts will be meaningful. My gift must be put to good use. If I offer this temple and it is used, it will make me very happy.”#23
$4 Venerable Pūrṇa, the superintendent, replied to the master builder, “Householder, no other ascetic or brahmin would be able to make use of this temple with its sandalwood courtyard, which has been built exclusively for the Blessed One, exclusively with the Blessed One in mind, and exclusively for the sake of the Blessed One. And why? Householder, because the Blessed One’s offering bowl, robes, sitting mat, clothing, park, walkway, seat, and dwelling place are objects venerated by gods and men, including divine beings, demons, Brahmā, ascetics, and brahmins. [2.b] No one else can use them. And why? Because no ascetic or brahmin has such qualities. There is no ascetic or brahmin who has comparable qualities to the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha. His qualities are limitless. Householder, the Blessed One has countless qualities, inconceivable qualities, incomparable qualities, boundless qualities, and inexpressible qualities. Householder, the Blessed One has limitless knowledge, infinite knowledge, inconceivable knowledge, incomparable knowledge, boundless knowledge, and inexpressible knowledge.#24

Knowledge of What is Possible
$58 “Householder, you may wonder how the Thus-Gone One correctly understands the knowledge of what is possible. [6.b] Householder, this is how the Thus-Gone One knows it.

In this way, seeking purification, they apply themselves to this training because of perceiving many benefits and auspicious qualities in such religious practitioners and brahmins. Then, having turned to what those ascetics and brahmins have taught, they say to others, ‘You must meet this venerable teacher! You have to understand this view!’ It is also possible and feasible that some people obtain the eight human existences.#25 It is also possible and feasible that a man can become Brahmā, Māra, or a brahmin. It is also possible and feasible that a man can become a universal monarch. It is also possible and feasible that a man can become a thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha.

He can respond for one hundred eons, or one thousand eons, or one hundred thousand eons, or one million eons, or ten million eons, [7.b] or a quadrillion eons, or one hundred quadrillion eons, or an immeasurable number of eons.

He illuminated them and cleared away their darkness. He has freed innumerable beings from suffering and established them in happiness. That is the knowledge of cessation as related to knowledge of what is possible. Moreover, householder, this is how the Thus-Gone One knows: When an assemblage is lacking there is an obstruction of knowledge, but when an assemblage takes place, knowledge of what is possible arises. Moreover, this is primordially unborn. Householder, this is how the Thus-Gone One correctly understands the knowledge of cessation as related to knowledge of what is possible.

Knowledge of What is Impossible

It is also impossible and unfeasible that by committing positive verbal and mental acts, after the body disintegrates and one dies, one will fall into the sad destinies of the lower realms and take birth in the hells. It is also impossible and unfeasible that people who have the correct view would willingly end the life of their mother, or their father, or a worthy one, or cause a schism in the saṅgha, or with evil intentions draw blood from the body of the Thus-Gone One. It is also impossible and unfeasible that people who have the correct view would adopt the teachings of other extremist teachers and the views of such teachers, and engage in their practices. They will not perceive any benefits or auspicious qualities in such religious practitioners and brahmins, nor will they adopt what those ascetics and brahmins have taught, and say to others, ‘You must meet this venerable teacher! You have to understand this view!’ It is also impossible and unfeasible that people who have the correct view obtain the eight human existences. It is also impossible and unfeasible that a woman can become Śakra, Māra, or Brahmā in that very body. It is also impossible and unfeasible that a woman can become a universal monarch in that very body. [10.a] It is also impossible and unfeasible that a woman can become a thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha in that very body.#26 It is also impossible and unfeasible that two thus-gone ones can appear in a single world. Householder, this is how the Thus-Gone One correctly understands the knowledge of what is impossible.
$64 “Householder, moreover, the Thus-Gone One correctly understands the state of beings who have become impossible recipients. He knows who is averse to billions of buddhas and who therefore is not a vessel for the teachings of the buddhas, the teachings of the solitary buddhas, or the teachings of the hearers.

Moreover, householder, the Thus-Gone One correctly understands the knowledge of the path that leads to cessation as related to knowledge of what is impossible whether he contemplates insipidity, or whether he contemplates no shortcomings, or whether he contemplates no deliverance.

One adopts the path of the ten virtues and enjoys perfect circumstances, yet one is not under the influence of an Almighty, or haughtiness, but one is grounded in virtue. Already in this life one will be happy and [14.b] experience pleasant circumstances, while being praised by the learned.
