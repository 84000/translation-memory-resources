The Dharma Scripture “Exposition of Karma” in one fascicle
The Translation
$1 [298.b][299.a] Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!
$2 Thus did I hear at one time:#34 The Bhagavān was staying in Śrāvastī in Prince Jeta’s Grove, the park donated by Anāthapiṇḍada, together with a large assembly of twelve hundred fifty monks.#35
$3 On that occasion the brahmin youth Śuka,#36 the son of Taudeya, went to where the Bhagavān was staying. Upon his arrival, he exchanged many courteous and amiable pleasantries with the Bhagavān and remained standing to one side.#37 The brahmin youth Śuka, the son of Taudeya, then addressed the Bhagavān with the following question: “Gautama, if I ask you a small question, will you kindly give an answer?”#38 [868]
$4 The Bhagavān replied, “Young brahmin, ask whatever you like! I will answer.”
Then the brahmin youth Śuka, the son of Taudeya, asked the Bhagavān the following question: “Sir#39 Gautama, there are many types of sentient beings, such as beings who have a short lifespan or a long lifespan, have many illnesses or few illnesses, are ugly or beautiful, have little power or are powerful, are highborn or lowborn, are poor or rich, are ignorant of the Dharma,#40 or possess knowledge of the Dharma to a lesser or greater degree, have good or bad fortune, and so forth. How does karmic ripening lead to this diversity of beings?”#41
$5 The Bhagavān replied, “Young brahmin, listen#42 and pay careful attention to what I shall explain.#43 Young brahmin, sentient beings are the owners of their actions committed in former lives;#44 sentient beings have actions as their heritage, actions as their origin, actions as their individual causes; sentient beings develop through actions, young brahmin.#45[299.b]
$6 “Therefore, again, the multiple varieties of sentient beings, due to their being bad, good, or middling, are karmically connected with many kinds of actions, many kinds of sufferings, and many kinds of views, in accordance with what I have taught as the black and white fruits of karmic ripening.#46 Young brahmin, it is like this: Through carrying out black actions, sentient beings are reborn in the unfortunate rebirth destinies;#47 they are reborn as hell beings, animals, ghosts (that is, those who have gone to the afterlife#48), and asuras.#49 Through carrying out white actions, beings are reborn as devas or as humans.
$7 “Therefore, young brahmin, [869] as a result of one’s actions,#50 one’s life is short or long, one has many or few illnesses, one is ugly or beautiful, one is insignificant or influential, one is lowborn#51 or highborn, one is poor or rich, one is ignorant of the Dharma,#52 or one has extensive knowledge of the Dharma;#53 as a result of one’s actions, one is reborn as a hell being, an animal, a ghost, an asura, a human, a deva possessing a physical body,#54 or a deva without a physical body; as a result of one’s actions, one’s rebirth is determinate in accordance with the action,#55 one’s rebirth is indeterminate,#56 there is rebirth in a foreign country, there is rebirth through carrying out an action without intent,#57 there is rebirth when one has intended an action but not carried it out, there is rebirth when one has intended an action and carried it out, [300.a] and there is rebirth when one has neither intended an action nor carried it out. There are also actions that, when accumulated,#58 lead to rebirth into a new existence only after the lifespan in hell has been completed; furthermore, there are actions that, when accumulated, lead to rebirth into a new existence after only half the lifespan in hell is exhausted, [870] as well as actions that lead to rebirth immediately upon arriving in hell.#59 There are actions that, when accumulated, lead to future unhappiness following upon past happiness.#60 There are actions that, when accumulated, lead to to future happiness following upon past unhappiness.#61 There are actions that, when accumulated by people and sentient beings,#62 lead to future happiness following upon past happiness. There are actions that, when accumulated, lead to miserliness, to being poor and generous, to being wealthy and generous, and to being poor and miserly. There are individuals whose lifespans are exhausted but not their actions,#63 there are individuals whose actions are exhausted but not their lifespans, and there are individuals whose lifespans and actions are simultaneously exhausted. There are individuals who will eliminate their sufferings although neither their lifespans nor their actions are exhausted. There are individuals who will become unwell in their minds while their bodies are well.#64 There are actions that lead an individual to be well in their mind while their body is unwell,#65 or to be well in mind and body,#66 or to be unwell in both mind and body.#67 There are actions that, when accumulated, lead to having a body that is graceful,#68 beautiful looking, and pretty, with a nice and glossy complexion, a feast for the eyes, although an individual is reborn in an inferior form of existence.#69 There are actions that, when accumulated, lead to having an inferior physique, [300.b] a crude body and an unpleasant and unsightly appearance for an individual reborn in an inferior form of existence. [871] Furthermore, young brahmin, it is like this: through carrying out the ten nonvirtuous courses of action, conditions in one’s environment will deteriorate.#70

$27 “In what way does action lead to rebirth as a deva in one of the six heavens of sensuous pleasure?#167 Ten factors lead to rebirth as a deva in one of the six heavens of sensuous pleasure. By not violating, and remaining diligently committed#168 to, the ten virtuous courses of action, one will be reborn as a deva in one of the six heavens of sensuous pleasure.
$28 “In what way does action lead to rebirth as a deva possessing a physical body? Ten factors lead to rebirth as a deva possessing a physical body. What are the ten? While one is devoted to the ten virtuous courses of action, one brings the six perfections and the four boundless states to perfection—this will lead to rebirth [878] as a deva possessing a physical body.#169
$29 “In what way does action lead to rebirth as a deva without a physical body?#170 Practicing the ten virtuous factors and the four states of imperturbability#171 leads to rebirth as a deva without a physical body. As for the four states of imperturbability:#172
$30 1. “One transcends all materiality by contemplating the infinity of space, so that, when all names designating physical objects#173 have become inexpressible and void,#174 one goes beyond labeling and imagining the manifold phenomena, [303.b] but one does not grasp#175 at the stillness#176 that is produced by#177 the sphere of infinite space.
$31 2. “Having completely transcended the entire sphere of infinite space, one contemplates the infinity of consciousness, but one does not grasp at the stillness that is produced by the sphere of infinite consciousness.
$32 3. “Having completely transcended the entire sphere of infinite consciousness, one contemplates that nothing at all exists, but one does not grasp at the stillness that is produced by the sphere of nothingness. 
$33 4. “Having completely transcended the entire sphere of nothingness, one contemplates that neither mind nor no-mind exists, but one does not grasp at the stillness that is produced by the sphere of neither mind nor no-mind. 
$34 “It is through these four factors#178 that one will be reborn as a deva in the formless realm.
$35 “How does action lead to a predetermined rebirth?#179 Having carried out actions based on the roots of wholesome states, one dedicates them to whichever rebirth location one has aspired to;#180 or one commits the evil actions that bring immediate karmic retribution. In these ways, one’s rebirth will have the nature of being predetermined.
$36 “How can rebirth be changed through action?#181 A person carries out a virtuous action and makes an aspiration prayer—by virtue of this action, that person’s rebirth destiny can be changed.#182
$37 “How does action cause a person to be reborn in another country? After one has contemplated with strong faith either the Buddha, the Dharma, the Saṅgha, or any person who possesses moral discipline, [879] one makes an offering and prays to be reborn in another country.#183 According to whatever [other] actions one has committed, their good or bad#184 [karmic results] are exemplified in the story of the merchant: his actions ripened after he had traveled to a foreign country.#185
$38 “What kind of action is considered to be carried out without intent?#186 Having carried out an action, one feels remorse, is conscience stricken, thinks that one has made a mistake and that it was wrong, and confesses; one does not give up effacing it, one does not engage in it again, and one vows not to do it again in the future. This kind of action [304.a] is considered to be carried out without intent. 
$39 “What kind of action#187 is considered to be intended but not carried out? An action was not physically carried out#188 if, when the thought welled up#189 and at that moment one said, ‘I will do this,’ one did not carry it out. This kind of action is considered to be intended but not carried out. 
$40 “What kind of action is considered to be intended and carried out?#190 Whatever action one has carried out, one does not feel remorse, is not conscience stricken, does not think that it was a mistake, does not confess, does not try to efface it, engages in it again, and does not vow to not do it again in the future. 
$41 “What kind of action, when accumulated, leads a person who has been born in a hell realm to be reborn#191 again as a hell being after completion of the full lifespan of the hell realm?#192 Suppose one has carried out an intentional action that leads to rebirth in hell, and one does not feel remorse, is not conscience stricken, does not consider one’s action a mistake, does not consider it inappropriate, does not confess, does not try to efface it, engages again in this evil action, even vows to commit this action again in the future, rejoices in this action, and admires such action. A person who has accumulated such an action will be reborn in the hell realm, and after completion of the full lifespan of the hell realm, [880] will again be reborn in hell.
$42 “What kind of action, when accumulated, leads a person who has been born in a hell realm to be reborn again as a hell being after only half of the lifespan in that hell has elapsed? Suppose one has carried out an action that leads to rebirth in hell, but one feels remorse, is conscience stricken, and thinks that one has made a mistake and that it was wrong; and one confesses, does not give up effacing it, does not engage in this evil action again, and vows not to commit this action again in the future. While one who has accumulated this kind of action will be reborn as a hell being, one will subsequently take rebirth after only half the lifespan in that hell has elapsed. 
$43 “What kind of action, when accumulated, leads a person who has been born in a hell realm to be reborn immediately upon rebirth in the hells? Suppose one has carried out an intentional action that leads to rebirth in hell, but one feels remorse, is conscience stricken, thinks that one has made a mistake and that it was wrong; [304.b] and one confesses, does not give up effacing it, does not engage in this evil action again, and vows not to commit it again in the future; and later, one is unhappy about having carried out such an action, dispenses with, shuns, and renounces this action, and arouses an intense sense of renunciation.#193 The person who has accumulated such an action will take rebirth immediately upon being born into the hell realm, as did King Ajātaśatru, for example.#194
$44 “What kind of action, when accumulated, leads a person to be happy at first, and become unhappy later? Suppose one makes a donation but does not give joyfully.#195 By failing to make one’s mind happy and joyful, one feels regret after having given. Then, when one is reborn as a human, one will be born into a wealthy family, richly endowed with wealth and possessions. Having become an important person of high rank, one will have many ministers, [305.a] assistants, relatives, and clan members;#196 [881] one will have many possessions; and one’s treasury and granary will always be well filled. One will be happy and possess many mounts and carriages.#197 Throughout, one is enjoying happiness, but later it diminishes and is exhausted. Having thus arrived at unhappiness, the person who has accumulated such an action consequently is powerful, wealthy, and happy at first; but later, weakened by hunger, becomes unhappy. 
$45 “What kind of action, when accumulated, leads a person to be unhappy at first, and happy in the future as a karmic result?#198 Suppose one makes an offering without faith at first, but later one’s mind grows faithful and one feels elated.#199 If one is reborn as a human, one will be born into a poor family. Food and possessions will be scarce. From a state of being distressed and without food and clothing, one will later become powerful, wealthy, and happy, and everything will increase. A person who has thus come to lack nothing#200 is unhappy at first but becomes happy in the future. 
$46 “What kind of action, when accumulated, leads a person to be happy at first, and happy in the future? Suppose that one makes a lavish offering and gives it joyfully, and that because of giving, one’s own mind becomes happy, and one does not have regrets later. The karmic fruit for one such as this, if reborn as human, is that one will be born into a wealthy family and enjoy abundant wealth. After becoming an important person of high rank, one will have many ministers, assistants, relatives, and clan members; one will have plentiful possessions, and the granary will always be full. One will be profoundly happy and possess many mounts and carriages. Born in such a family, happiness of that kind will arise and increase.#201 Therefore, a person, by accumulating such an action, will be happy at first, and in the future. 
$47 “What kind of action, when accumulated, leads a person to be unhappy at first, and unhappy in the future as a karmic result?#202 [882] Suppose one has abandoned one’s virtuous friend, no one at all has encouraged one to engage in generosity, and one also has not made any offerings to others on one’s own accord. If one such as this is reborn as a human, one will be poor and famished, lacking food and drink, lacking clothing, and therefore living in distress, or one will live without food, drink, or clothing. Also, in the future, due to those conditions one will not become happy or enjoy an increase in resources. One who has accumulated such an action will not be happy at first and will also be unhappy in the future. 
$48 “What kind of action, when accumulated, leads a person to be stingy although being wealthy as a karmic result? Suppose one is not at all magnanimous toward worthy recipients of offerings and offers only a small amount; through being parsimonious when giving, while nonetheless making it a habit, one will be born in a wealthy family. Although one will have at one’s disposal extensive wealth and many possessions, one will be stingy. A person who has accumulated such an action will, although wealthy, be very stingy. 
$49 “What kind of action leads a person to be wealthy and generous as a karmic result?#203 Suppose one offers lavishly and has developed the habit of making very a large offering to a worthy recipient of offerings. If one is reborn as a human, one will be reborn into a wealthy family; one can lead a life of abundance in food and possessions,#204 and one will be a generous person. The accumulation of such an action leads to being wealthy and generous. 
$50 “What kind of action leads a person to be poor and generous as a karmic result? Suppose one offers lavishly and has made it a habit to make a large offering to those who are not worthy recipients of offerings. If one is reborn as a human, one will be reborn into a poor family, [305.b] will not be able to lead a life of abundance in food and possessions, and will suffer hardship.#205 [883] But even though one does not have enough clothing or food to provide for one’s own life, one is generous. A person who has accumulated such an action will be poor and generous. 
$51 “What kind of action, when accumulated, leads a person to be poor and stingy? Suppose one has abandoned one’s virtuous friend, no one at all has encouraged one to engage in generosity, and neither has one made any offerings on one’s own accord#206—but one has not intentionally carried out any evil actions—then, even if one were to be reborn as a human, one would be born into a poor family. One would live without food or possessions and suffer hardship. Constantly toiling to obtain clothing and food, one will be stingy. A person who has accumulated such an action will be poor and stingy. 
$52 “What kind of persons have exhausted their lifespans but not the potential of their past actions?#207 Suppose that someone, although having passed away in the hell realm, is subsequently reborn in hell; or having passed away as an animal, is reborn as an animal; or having passed away in the ghost realm, is reborn as a ghost; or having passed away in the realm of asuras, is reborn as an asura; or having died as a human, is reborn as a human. Such persons have exhausted their lifespans but not the potential of their past actions. 
$53 “What kind of persons have exhausted the potential of their past actions but not their lifespans? Those who formerly were happy and later became unhappy; or those who formerly were unhappy and later became happy. Such persons have exhausted the potential of their past actions but not their lifespans. 
$54 “What kind of persons have exhausted both the potential of their past actions and their lifespans? Suppose a person, having passed away in the hell realm, is reborn as an animal; or having passed away as an animal, is reborn as a ghost; or having passed away as a ghost, is reborn as an asura; or having passed away as an asura, is reborn as a human; or having passed away as a human, is reborn as a god. Such persons have exhausted both the potential of their past actions and their lifespans. 
$55 “What kind of persons, through which kind of action, [884] have eliminated suffering while neither their lifespans nor the potential of their past actions is exhausted?
