The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra
The Good Eon
Chapter 1
$1 [1.b] Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.
$2 Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing at Śrāvasti, where he had observed the summer retreat. After the three months of summer had passed, he prepared his Dharma robes. Once he had prepared his Dharma robes, he put on the robes, took up his alms bowl, and, together with one hundred thousand monks and eight hundred million bodhisattvas, proceeded toward the city of Vaiśālī. On the way, the Blessed One entered a large forest, where he later arose from meditative seclusion.
$3 The bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja, [2.a] who had also entered meditative seclusion, now likewise reemerged from this state. He and the whole assembly of monks, nuns, male lay practitioners, female lay practitioners, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahorāgas were now seated on their mats. All of the assembled bodhisattvas had attained illumination, retention, and absorption. They were endowed with the five superknowledges, their words were worthy of retention, and they were free from pretense, had no worldly ambitions, and were free from attachment. They taught the Dharma without any regard for material things. They had perfected acceptance of the profound Dharma, had accomplished fearlessness, and were beyond the actions of the māras. They had shed karmic obscurations, achieved the state free from any doubt about the nature of the Dharma, and accumulated aspirations throughout countless eons. They had smiles on their faces, spoke straightforwardly, and never frowned. They communicated in melodious voices, their minds were indomitable, and the flow of their eloquence was unbroken. They had achieved acceptance of equality. They were able to outshine infinite gatherings without any fear. They were adept at elaborating on a single word throughout ten million eons.
$4 They were confident that all phenomena are just like illusions, a mirage, the moon in water, dreams, and echoes. Their minds were endowed with infinite fearlessness, and they were confident in knowing the most subtle movements in the minds of sentient beings, as well as every aspect of their conduct. They possessed vast virtue [2.b] and their minds were unimpeded. They were free from exaggerating pride and endowed with patience. Their virtues were genuinely comprehensive. Their aspirations encompassed infinite arrays of buddha realms. They constantly manifested the absorption of recollecting the buddhas of countless world systems. They were skilled in supplicating boundless buddhas. They were skilled in quelling differing views, as well as latent tendencies and the fetters of emotional defilements. They were skilled in accomplishing hundreds of thousands of displays through absorption. They included the bodhisattva Maitreya, as well as the youthful Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Sound of Thunder,#10 Mind of Blooming Flowers of a Hundred Thousand Virtues, Possessor of the Mind of Infinite Practice and the Speech That Is Adorned with Flashes of Lightning, Possessor of the Mind of Complete Detachment, King of Renown, Perceiver of the Agreeable and the Disagreeable, King of the Splendid Light of Deep Accumulations of Gold, Seeing and Moving Across a Hundred Yojanas, Heaps of Eloquence, Mass of Wisdom, Amoghadarśin, Bhadrapāla, the Eight Holy Beings,#11 Gandhahastin, Jewel Treasury, Heaps of Insight, Array of Offerings, King of the Melodious Lion’s Roar, Adorned with Arrays of Wisdom, Moving with the Gait of a Lion, Fearless in Limitless Mastery of Eloquence, the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja, and others.
$5 From the world systems of the great trichiliocosm came the Four Great Kings, Śakra, Brahmā, Īśvara, Mahābrahmā, [3.a] nāga leaders, yakṣa leaders, asura leaders, garuḍa leaders, kinnara leaders, mahorāga leaders, and gandharva leaders, arriving in the presence of the Blessed One, scattering flowers before him, and then taking their places in the gathering.
$6  At that time, the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja observed seven days of fasting during which he would either stand or sit upright, practicing with unrelenting diligence, free from drowsiness and without sleep. It was then that the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja spoke to the Blessed One: “Which quality must bodhisattvas perfect in order for them to know the thoughts and conduct of all sentient beings, to apply the words that have the intent of all the buddhas, to avoid teaching based on incorrect teachings, to follow knowledge grounded in truth as literally expressed, and to become free of any obscuration with respect to all the buddhas of the present? Through which quality may they be able to accompany and perceive the buddhas, achieve certainty through the Dharma, follow the ways of the world without becoming stained by the world, abide in meditative attainments without taking birth in the corresponding realms, practice the Dharma of nirvāṇa without transcending suffering, and practice the Dharma of hearers and solitary buddhas in which the aspirations of buddhahood are not perfected, without achieving deliverance through those vehicles? Through which quality may their minds be unclouded in recollecting the buddhas, may they engage with the different dispositions and also be in accord with them all, not become overpowered by any question or eloquence, [3.b] apprehend all the infinite displays of the buddha realms, attain all forms of insight, bring sentient beings to maturation without adhering to the notion of ‘sentient being,’ teach the Dharma yet not fixate on any objective references, explain nirvāṇa yet not objectify this peacefulness in any way, act for the sake of awakening without fixation, and give up existence, as well as no existence, but aspire to what is vast? Blessed One, I do not ask in this way without any knowledge. Nevertheless, please explain.”
$7 Then the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja spoke these verses:
“A large assembly of gods, humans, yakṣas, and gandharvas
Have gathered here in accordance with their infinite aspirations.
What is the practice of the bodhisattvas?
You are the protector of the worlds, the Illuminator,
$8 “Moon of Speech—as I beseech you,
Please give the teaching in step-by-step fashion.
When common people hear of the qualities of supreme awakening,
They become inspired and endeavor for awakening.
$9 “With faith in the supreme qualities of awakening,
I ask you who have perfected all good qualities.
Master of infinite renown, do you know my mind?
Other than the Victorious One, who could be my witness?
$10 “Gods and humans are thirsting for the qualities of the victorious ones.
Please explain, delineating the practices of the ten powers.
You possess the supreme qualities and have the qualities of awakening.
You who know the great ways of renown and beauty, please explain!
$11 “How do the brilliant light rays of wisdom
Conquer the forces of darkness and their armies?
How is the trichiliocosm quickly shaken?
Well-Gone One, please explain about such activities of awakening.
$12 “How does the flower of the buddha marks blossom?
How does one come to possess an infinite voice? [4.a]
How does the absorption that resembles Sumeru arise?
Please explain such practices of the mind of awakening.
$13 “Incomparable and unrivaled, you are without guile or pretense,
Selfless, worthy, and free from contamination of the three stains.
You are the supreme mendicant praised by throngs of the learned—
I ask you about the practices of supreme people.
$14 “Your understanding is stable and mindful, and you have the flower of speech.
Unconfused, you master excellent conduct and are the best of orators.
Good person free from stains, supreme leader and benefactor,
Please teach me how to become victorious.
$15 “When I have heard these matters from you,
I shall pursue the true practices of awakening throughout day and night.
Without anything else occupying my mind,
I shall joyfully devote myself fully to these practices.
$16 “How does one possess absorption and retention?
How does one possess wisdom, insight, and eloquence?
How is one able to behold buddhas in infinite directions,
And to ask questions regarding what is right and what is not?
$17 “How is unequaled wisdom realized?
How are the hundreds of avenues of virtue accomplished?
And how does the teaching become free from error?
This I ask of you, who practices the ten powers.
$18 “I ask not out of attachment to the pleasures of existence,
Or because I am swayed by objects.
I cherish the elixir of the victorious ones.
So please, quickly, teach me about the practice of the ten powers!”
$19 The Blessed One then spoke to the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja: “Excellent, Prāmodyarāja, excellent! I possess the absorption called elucidating the way of all phenomena. When bodhisattvas possess that absorption, they attain those qualities. Furthermore, they perfect one hundred and twenty-one perfections. They attain eighty-four thousand absorptions and eighty-four thousand retentions. They realize expert ways of engaging in the conduct of all sentient beings, [4.b] and they quickly awaken to unexcelled, complete, and perfect buddhahood.
$20  “Prāmodyarāja, what is the absorption called elucidating the way of all phenomena? It is doing exactly what one says. It is saying exactly what one has done.

It is being free from animosity, pacifying disputes, praising peace, endeavoring in the accumulations, and having equal concern for those who are one’s friends and those who are not one’s friends.
$24 “It is pursuing retention. It is respectfully serving all beings as if they were one’s mother, respectfully serving all wise ones as if they were one’s father, respectfully serving all masters as if they were one’s own preceptor, venerating the bodhisattvas as if they were buddhas, worshiping the thus-gone ones, aspiring to virtue, and untiringly venerating the Three Jewels.

It is inspiration for the highly motivated, the disposition to behold the protectors of the three worlds, a treasury for those in pursuit of wealth, and a field of those endowed with ripening. It is true happiness for the tormented, a park for those who have achieved retention, a pool for those who have attained absorption, a mother for those endowed with virtuous qualities, a support for those inspired by speech, the cause of the major marks of the buddhas, the discernment of the minor marks, and the refuge of the buddha realms. It is the full attainment of retention, mastery of attainment, and perfectly reasonable speech.
$27 “It is transcendence of the realm of the māras, the realm of heroes, conquering the emotional defilements, demolishing unvirtuous actions, the adornment of those with aspirations, and invulnerability to the māras. It is the inexhaustible teachings, what is hard to fathom for non-Buddhist sectarians, what is dissimilar to the world, what transcends the Dharma of the hearers, and what is not the deliverance of the solitary buddhas. It is attaining omniscience, [7.a] entering the existences of sentient beings, and inspiration for the ultimate state of reality. It is delighting those wishing for food, and satisfying those thirsting for drink. It is the essence of those who attain nirvāṇa, the chariot of those who attain nirvāṇa, the boat for sailing to the other shore, the boat for those wishing to cross, the lamp for the compassionate, the shooting star for the teachers of Dharma, the abode of those wishing for freedom from deception, wealth for those wishing to give, knowledge for those wishing for liberation, ennoblement for those in pursuit of amusements, an ocean for those wishing to learn, Mount Sumeru for those who accomplish absorption, a sense faculty for those who desire eyes, a display for those wishing to see, delight for those endowed with mind, the abode of nonregression, and the intention of those who have attained acceptance that phenomena are unborn.
$28 “It is the cultivation of beginners, the banner of people with understanding, the awakening of those who revere calm abiding, and the Nārāyaṇa of those who teach the absence of self. It is the path of omniscience, the equality of birth for those with wisdom and liberation, what is praised by the gods, what is extolled by the nāgas, what is worshiped by humans, what inspires wonder in those in training, what is revered by those beyond training, what is applauded by the bodhisattvas, and what is cultivated by the lords of Dharma. It is the city of those who guard their faculties, the way of skillful ones, the attainment of the diligent, the dispelling of doubts, cutting through doubts, dispelling the defilements, and the retentions of the bodhisattvas.

$29 “It is embracing the vajra-like absorption, the lion throne for those in their final existence, the roots of virtue for those who pursue nondegeneracy, giving joy to the sad, uplifting the downtrodden, fortifying the diligent, and accomplishing the dispositions of conduct. It is contemplation for the idle, the declaration of the equality of the three vehicles, abandoning all grasping, perfecting omniscience, thoroughly attaining the infinite gateways of those who teach the ultimate, ensuring that the qualities of the teaching of emptiness are not wasted, and perfecting the strength of the gateways of aspiration. It is communication for those who are inspired toward the absence of marks, the equality of the three times for those who are inspired toward seeing and equanimity, skill in universal outreach, and teaching awakening. It is not being vulnerable to denigration by others.
$30 “It is the Dharma teachers’ pursuit of freedom from delusion, following Dharma teachers who are free of materialistic concerns, and listening to the Dharma without distraction. It is the unblemished retinue, the absence of obstacles for giving the Dharma, causing amazement in those who ask questions with conviction, dispelling regret, continuous engagement, not abandoning the accumulation of wisdom, the liberation of those who grasp, the taming of those who are offensive, and shedding the defilements. It is practicing without supports, [8.a] being mindful of those wishing for mindfulness, uplifting the bodhisattvas, teaching the fourfold retinue, and the sweetest among delicious tastes. It is a declaration for those wishing for miraculous abilities, an open door for those wishing to turn back from existence, the liberation in nirvāṇa, a blissful body, a blissful mind, the joy of the wise, the nonabdication of firm commitments, and the undeterred attainment of the qualities of the thus-gone ones.
$31 “It is the abode of the roots of virtue, the destruction of nonvirtue, training for those with misguided intelligence, the abode of those adhering to reason, the nondeceptive guide, the attainment of the light of the buddhas, the light of the mass of wisdom, and displaying the realms of the buddhas. It is the posing of millions of questions, thinking of virtuous qualities, a focal point for the weary, not forsaking those of poor intelligence, and delighting the knowledgeable. It is the cause of action for those wishing to teach, the protector of those who teach the Dharma, knowledge of all causes, and skill in means regarding all phenomena.

It is the power of beings who have gained fame, the cleansing of those who are stained, and overcoming the view that takes the aggregates to be a person.
$32 “It is retaining what is heard and retaining the teachings of the Dharma. It is unmistaken awakening, unceasing engagement with virtuous factors, vast accumulations of virtue, the basis for attaining wisdom, the Dharma way of the diligent, expanding the saṅgha of noble beings, eliminating the criticism of others, approving of those who teach the Dharma, and the conduct of bodhisattvas. It is the moon for those wishing to play, the sun for those who pursue livelihood, the treatise for those wishing to train, the king of those who are respected, the guide of the learned, the seed of virtuous factors, the nectar of the ripened fruit, the basis for recollecting births, the attainment of birth, contempt for childish teachings, the authentic qualities of the teachings of the thus-gone ones, and the infinite ripening of those who teach and uphold the Dharma. It is a foundation of omniscience, attainment of the higher realms in teaching, abandoning all fears in posing questions, never turning back when crossing over, and a foundation for expressing realization. It is letting the entire world ponder the Dharma, the words of all the buddhas of the past, the treasure of the wisdom of all the buddhas of the present, and the perfection of the realization of all the buddhas of the future.
$33 “It is quickly attaining unshakable true wisdom, the seal that emerges from the Buddha’s hand,#14 and the insatiability of those who wish to ask about the Buddhadharma. It is the quelling of aggressive cognitions, [9.a] the attainment of skillful means, cultivating the earth element, engaging with the water element, balancing the fire element, stabilizing the wind element, and attaining liberation in the space element. It is revealing the element of consciousness, dissatisfaction with conditioned factors, bringing an end to latent tendencies, dispelling anger, letting go in equanimity, skill regarding one’s own support, skill regarding the support of others, and words for those wishing to speak. It is freedom from clinging to accomplishments, relinquishing the idea of ‘I,’ relinquishing the idea of ‘mine,’ the basis for reversing inclinations, a cautious mind, attending to the mind like a guard dog, entering the vast, and comprehending the subtle.
$34 “It is shade for the weary, traversing the river, being indomitable when under attack, the staff of good people, veneration for spiritual teachers, giving up dullness and sleep, going beyond agitation, giving up doubt, dispelling the wish for pleasure, and giving up laziness. It is not observing a self, not propounding the existence of a sentient being, not fixating on a life force, being free from forgetfulness regarding the Dharma, speaking flawless words, speaking with reason, properly contemplating the process of formation, the essence of mastery, the essence of being undeterred, inspiration toward generosity and wisdom, entering the retinue without timidity, not disparaging others, not proclaiming one’s own qualities, and constant commitment for the sake of awakening. It is diligent engagement, not staying for long in any location, giving up grasping, engaging in auspicious activities, not being of the body, an undaunted mind, [9.b] expertise regarding the supports, cultivating recollection, being unswerving and free from pride, pursuing liberation, the resolution of doubt, taking birth in the pure abodes, the mind of equal love, the compassionate embrace, the joyous experience of appreciating oneself, dispelling attachment and anger within impartiality, accepting others through discipline, entering the attainment of absorption, and entering the liberation of all factors through insight. It is understanding the use of syllables, skill in etymology, mastering expressions, engaging with language, pursuit of the essence of expertise, and expressing the gift of Dharma without vested desires. It is having no zeal for single-minded certainty, not growing tired of a single approach, neither accepting nor rejecting what concerns awakening, not squandering any dharma, teaching correctly, and not deceiving any sentient being. It is the perfection of stable aspiration, continuous engagement throughout day and night, the conduct of the bodhisattvas, entering the realms of sentient beings, and accomplishing omniscience. Prāmodyarāja, this is the absorption that is known as elucidating the way of all phenomena.”
$35 At that time, the Blessed One spoke these verses:
“The path of the noble ones that purifies conduct,
The way of harmony that refines the mind,
And the way of the branches of awakening, the essence of eloquence—
This absorption is the treasure of the well-gone ones.
$36 “Stainless subduer of the māras that alone eliminates anger,
Insight that severs the craving for existence,
Perfectly granting the qualities of fame and renown,
Final deliverance from the three realms,
$37 “It is the ground of wisdom and is also the path of virtue. [10.a]
It is the family of the noble ones, the destroyer of māras,
The liberator from existence, praised by the well-gone ones—
This absorption is the wealth of the well-gone ones.
$38 “The gate to ten million ways of entering perfect equality,
The source of understanding, satisfaction, and severance,
Destroyer of suffering and harbinger of happiness—
This absorption is the conduct of the well-gone ones.
$39 “Making us recollect and understand the flower of the branches of awakening;
Amassing virtue, the excellent foundation, with a sense of modesty;
Delighting the well-gone ones with garlands of the branches of awakening—
This is the supreme absorption that is taught.
$40 “Garland of the branches of awakening, liberation;
Conqueror of birth, culminating in the buddhafields;
Granter of moonlight, illuminator, beyond the three realms—
This supreme Dharma is praised by the moon.
$41 “Giving up distractions, pretenses, and the worldly aims,
Adhering to a forest retreat,
And purifying the three modes of engagement—
Thus, one shall attain this absorption.
$42 “Having relinquished the causes of attachments to others, deception, and profiteering,
You do not proclaim your own qualities.
May you don the three Dharma robes and live as a mendicant.
Thereby you will not engage in hoarding wealth.
$43 “Maintain the cheerful character of the noble ones,
And if you wish to quickly attain absorption,
Be wise and always ask questions.
Once you have asked, you should also adhere to realization.
$44 “Remaining far from gatherings and enjoying calm abiding,
Being a caring friend to all beings,
And always giving up fame, the basis for hypocrisy,
You should pursue this peaceful absorption.
$45 “Dress in modesty and savor the food of solitude.
Resting in concentration within your home in solitude,
If you take constant joy in the realization of selflessness,
You will not wish for the pleasures of other experts.
$46 “If you wish to quickly attain this absorption,
Be patient when others speak with anger,
Do not develop pride, let go of the sense of ‘I,’
And have firm faith in the ripening of karma. [10.b]
$47 “Without adhering to the paths and situations of the lower realms,
And without adhering to places devoid of noble beings,
Give rise to the power of diligence throughout day and night.
Thus, you must obtain this absorption—there is no other way.
$48 “Free from the unattractive paths of the two extremes,
This true way is a path of equality.
Whoever sees this uncreated and unborn Dharma
Will delight the buddhas with their accomplishment.
$49 “Prāmodyarāja, such is the absorption known as elucidating the way of all phenomena. Bodhisattvas who attain it comprehend all phenomena without error. They realize that all phenomena are unsupported. They realize all phenomena to be unborn. They realize all phenomena of the buddhas to be uncreated. They realize all phenomena to be hollow. They realize all phenomena to be fake. They realize all phenomena to be devoid of any essence. They become indomitable. They go beyond the five realms of wandering beings. They defeat the māras. They bring joy to all sentient beings. They receive the veneration of all the learned. They behold the whole nature of reality. They shine brightly like the moon. They know the movements in the minds of all sentient beings. They inspire everyone with pure intention. They know the whole trichiliocosm. They attain the level of devoted conduct.#15
$50 “They delve into selflessness. They comprehend the elements that are to be left behind. They attain the spiritual level that transcends the arrogating pride of all sentient beings. They transcend obscuration. They comprehend the nature of name and form. They reflect on the teaching of the buddhas in terms of creative etymologies. They attain the thirty-two marks.

They reveal deathlessness. They comprehend nirvāṇa. They dispel the torments of sentient beings. They cut through the doubts of sentient beings. They are not adulterated by the six faculties. They attain the retention of engaging in the sixteen syllables. Which are the sixteen syllables they attain the retention of engaging in? They are a, ra, pa, ca, na, da, sa, ka, tha, pa, ba, kṣa, cha, pa, ṭha, and ḍha. By means of the retention of engaging in these sixteen, they attain the spiritual level of accomplishment in infinite ways.
$51 “They comprehend the voidness of all phenomena. They gain certainty. They develop knowledge of the intentions of all sentient beings. In this way, all emotional defilements cease to exist. They understand the true nature of everything grasped by immature beings. They make headway. They satisfy all sentient beings. They offer worship by means of excellent speech. They provide the offering of deathlessness. They know all the deeds of the buddhas. They attain full knowledge. They cut through doubts in themselves and others. They are always eager to dispel the regrets of sentient beings. They obtain the melodious voice of the kalaviṅka bird. They gain attainment through equality. They bring forth the lion’s roar. They are sincere. They practice the perfection of patience and perfect great compassion. They go beyond the sphere of the māras. They perfect the melodious voice.
$52 “They achieve acceptance by having given up pride. They possess profound concentration. They teach the Dharma that conquers the world. They achieve depth. [11.b] They attain great strength and power with respect to all phenomena. They are full of knowledge, for they know in terms of all phenomena. They are mindful of the conduct of all sentient beings. Over countless eons they comprehend all things just as they are. They know all attacks. They attain the relinquishment of all thoughts of weariness. They quickly attain awakening. They are praised by the gods. They attend to all phenomena by means of knowledge. They are skilled in the achievement of meaningful objectives. All phenomena appear as they truly are to them. They partake of elixir as their food.
$53 “They cut through all doubts. They discard all connections created by habitual tendencies. They are enveloped by great compassion. They recollect the true intent. They cultivate recollections of past lives. They swiftly comprehend the activities associated with the qualities of nirvāṇa. They attain the level of being worshiped by great gatherings. They destroy all pride. They accomplish the level of power. They engage with the manifold. They know accomplishment. They know all ripening. They expand the realms of the buddhas. They conquer the māra of the aggregates. They quickly comprehend the teaching of realization. Thereby, they quickly destroy the māras. They quickly subdue the attacks of others. They see buddhas in innumerable realms of the world. They also listen to their Dharma. They do not forget the sacred Dharma. They accomplish the perfection of reveling in absorption according to will. Thus, as the bodhisattvas who attain this absorption are careful, they should be declared omniscient. Why is that? Because, depending entirely on their wishes, they may within just one single life, or within two lives, or three lives, or four, or after eons, awaken to perfect buddhahood. And why is that? Because this absorption is omniscience.”
$54 Then the Blessed One spoke these verses: [12.a]
“Those who uphold this way of practicing the ten powers
Are free from delusion, unshakable, and unparalleled.
They attain the nectar of immortality and strive,
With matchless glory, in the realms of gods and humans.
$55 “Those who uphold these ways of praise through the ten powers
Bring joy in overcoming the dirt and sod of the defilements,
And delight gods and humans with clear words.
Worthy of the qualities of the victors, they dispel the darkness of existence.
$56 “Those who engage in this practice to attain the ten powers
Destroy the lower realms and are expert about the lower realms.
They dispel the unwholesome orientations of gods and humans and bring them joy.
They are wise path masters who discern the conduct of others.
$57 “Engaging in this practice, they relinquish the vast realms of existence
And inspire the mistaken who have strayed there.
While they act in accordance with the wishes of gods and humans,
Such beings of power bring them vision, like unshrouded moons.
$58 “This practice is unequaled and gives constant joy to gods and humans.
The wise who are displeased with the realms of existence,
Yet not confused by objects,
Reveal to their retinues hundreds of ways of proclaiming the teachings.
$59 “Those who obtain the nectar from the city of the victors’ qualities,
Such benefactors who adopt it and reveal it,
Attain the thirty-two marks of beauty
And bring joy to gods and humans.
$60 “This practice dispels the barbarian hordes.
It subdues myriad beings and reveals magnificent qualities.
With swift skill regarding the māras, objects, and existences,
You are a supreme mendicant, praised by gods and humans for your qualities.
$61 “If you wish to attain the supreme wealth of immortality,
Then engage in this practice and you will soon be victorious.
With the sweet fragrance of the renowned, supreme qualities,
You will free gods and humans from fear and peacefully liberate their cities.
$62 “Those who practice in this way find joy in immortality.
Applying themselves correctly, they praise the well-gone ones of the ten directions.
They deliver discourses and delight gods and humans.
They beautifully explain the way of benefiting, taming, and achieving equipoise.
$63 “Helping the gods and asuras who live on earth reach nirvāṇa,
And destroying the armies of the māras,
They have come to worship the victors and are skilled in states of existence. [12.b]
With mindfulness they abandon existence and have qualities of expert understanding.
$64 “When you apprehend the supreme peace of this absorption,
Your faculties will be serene, you will embrace supreme wisdom,
And you will practice the conduct of a rhinoceros#16 and be free from grasping a self.
This is the ever-blazing comet of the Dharma.
$65 “Those who teach this ocean of wisdom
Realize the momentary nature of things.
In the three realms they are like lofty parasols,
Receiving the praises of the kings of the gods.
$66 “Those who exert themselves in this peace that is hard to find
Dispel the painful emotional defilements.
In the worlds of the well-gone ones they explain cessation,
Interrupting the defilements and taming the three realms.
$67 “Those who attain this supreme absorption
Are mindful of the conduct of others but also attend to their own deeds.
They develop abundant knowledge of the well-gone ones’ wisdom,
And adhere to it in all its aspects.
$68 “Those who accomplish this belong to the family of the buddhas,
Perfecting many millions of attainments.
They always alleviate painful interactions
And are teachers of immortality.
$69 “Exalted due to their beauty, delightful words, and renowned qualities,
They are in all regards adorned with the beauty of excellent qualities.
As they enter their assemblies
They shine like the full moon in the final month of autumn.
$70 “Those who adhere to this meditative absorption
Will, even within saṃsāra, have a retinue, enjoyments,
Family line, fame, and the recognition of the well-gone ones.
Their eloquent acumen will be as vast as the sea.
$71 “Those who practice this wondrous discourse
Will soon realize and teach
The selfless nature of all things,
Quickly becoming the doctor for the trichiliocosm.
$72 “Finding attainment beyond death, they pass beyond
All of humanity and all the realms of sentient beings in the trichiliocosm,
As numerous the sand grains in the river Gaṅgā,
And so they attain the gateways of wisdom.
$73 “Whoever engages in this practice with superior intent
Becomes immune to poison, weapons, and fire,
And will not fear being arrested and punished#17 by the king. [13.a]
They know no fear of kings or rākṣasas.
$74 “As they retain the four words,#18
They leave the household and do not waste the wealth of immortality.
They are not affected by fire, famine, or evil influence.
They do not become blind, deaf, or confused.
$75 “Those who practice this peaceful absorption
Will receive the treasure of retention.
Whoever practices this receives at that point
The attention of six hundred and twenty million well-gone ones.
$76 “If you wish to quickly reach awakening,
And if you wish for the supreme field of qualities,
Practice the way of this supreme discourse,
And omniscience will be in the palm of your hand.
$77 “Therefore, any sentient being who listens to this
And delights in virtue for the sake of awakening
Will attain the treasure of the ten powers
By applying themselves to this for four days.
$78 “Those who enter this supreme absorption
Will receive the constant attention
Of eight hundred million of the supreme among the two-legged,
As well as six hundred billion other victorious ones.#19
$79 “Those who listen to this teaching, obtain it well,
And become inspired by listening
Will give up uncertainty and achieve awakening;
They will no longer have doubts or meet with saṃsāra.
$80 “Those who listen to and correctly practice this discourse
With diligence and appreciation for its qualities,
Who write this discourse down and bear it,
Are certain to find omniscience in the palms of their hands.
$81 “With superknowledge I see that one hundred eons ago
There appeared a victorious one known as Crest Ornament of Eloquence.
He taught this supreme absorption
And the prince, Moon of Glory, listened.
$82 “The prince abandoned his kingdom and soon went forth,
Listening keenly throughout day and night.
In his final session, he passed away
And then took miraculous birth in a different realm.
$83 “There he worshiped the incomparable one for more days
Than there are grains of sand in the Gaṅgā.
And for the sake of realizing awakening
He immersed himself in listening to this absorption for an eon. [13.b]
$84 “As prophesied by the victorious Dīpaṅkara,
He became the victor known as Jewel Crown Ornament.
Hence, since the effects of hearing this are great,
Do not be lazy once you have heard it.
$85 “With beautiful melodies, bring gods and humans
To clear understanding and veneration.
Remember my explanation of this precious treasure.
Retain this jewel of the ten powers.
$86 “Prāmodyarāja, in the past—innumerable, uncountable eons before—there appeared a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a complete and perfect buddha known as Proclaimer of the Melodious Thundering Roar of the Ornamental Beauty of Eloquence. Among the propagators of his Dharma teachings was a teacher known as Crest of the Banner of the Qualities of Infinite Eloquence. When he taught this absorption, a prince known as Teaching the Dharma to Many as the Pure Ripening of Merit offered a precious and priceless garment, and at the same time aroused the attitude of thinking ‘May all sentient beings achieve this absorption!’
$87  “By the roots of virtue ensuing from this, he delighted thus-gone ones more numerous than the grains of sand found in eighty Gaṅgā Rivers. From all those blessed ones he received this absorption, and Dharma teachings that had not been taught before appeared. He then recollected his continuous miraculous births. This prince, Teaching the Dharma to Many as the Pure Ripening of Merit, attained perfect awakening and, in the buddha realm known as Aparimita­guṇa­vyūha, became known as the buddha Amitāyus.#20 The monk and Dharma teacher called Crest of the Banner of the Qualities of Infinite Eloquence became the thus-gone one known as Great Eye.
$88 “When the prince had heard this absorption, he relinquished the karmic obscurations created during seven million eons. In all his lives he never parted—even for just as long as it takes to snap one’s fingers—from the retention accomplished through the differentiating sections and infinite gateways. [14.a]
$89 “There was also a thus-gone one known as Bright Countenance Like the Stainless Moon of the Essence of Glorious Splendor who taught and explained this absorption. When the son of a merchant, Vast Beauty and Fine Shape, listened to this teaching with his mind, he went forth from the household, abandoning seventy wives, a treasury that covered a league, and one thousand eight hundred gardens. He never again set his foot on ground covered with fabric. For ten thousand years after he had gone forth, he never wore footwear except in the latrine, but kept diligently on the move, free from drowsiness and sleep. When ten thousand years had passed, he obtained the retention known as embodiment of the teachings, statements, and voices of all the buddhas, and he accomplished the absorption known as comprehending the use of all language. Receiving the veneration of six hundred thousand gods, he kept endeavoring. Now that he has accomplished virtue by body and mind, he resides in a world to the south that is adorned with all excellent qualities. There he has now truly awakened as a buddha and he is known as the thus-gone Reasoning Mind.”
$90 At that time the Blessed One spoke these verses:
“I recollect eons more numerous, by comparison,
Than the sands in the river Gaṅgā.
There once was a protector of the world
Who was known by the name of Melodious Eloquence.
$91 “A monk who was a skilled holder
Of that buddha’s teachings
Explained this absorption,
And a prince listened.
$92 “He offered his garments to the monk,
And made a dedication. [14.b]
Thus, he beheld the protectors, the buddhas,
And achieved awakening as Amitāyus.
$93 “The ripening of the karma
Committed in the past
Is all brought to exhaustion
Upon hearing this mass of wisdom.
$94 “Also, when the buddha Stainless Moon
Taught this meditative absorption,
A merchant son listened,
Abandoned his household, and went forth.
$95 “Relinquishing sleep and pleasures,
He refrained from wearing shoes,
And cultivated this absorption
For ten thousand years.
$96 “Just by hearing this,
He immediately attained supreme awakening,
Never looking back at the household, wealth, or pleasures,
And having no fondness for enjoyments.
$97 “He beheld infinite buddhas
And received teachings from them all.
Entering all the ways of the teachings,
He quickly realized them all.
$98 “Practicing this absorption,
He has become known as Reasoning Mind.
Perfecting all intentions,
He has attained swift awakening.
$99 “When in future times
People listen to this seal of wisdom,
They may feel no enjoyment or happiness,
Nor any wish to go forth.
$100 “They may revile,
Abuse, threaten,
And disparage one another,
Yet still they will declare, ‘I shall become a buddha.’
$101 “Those who have thousands of miseries in their home,
Yet still accept this as they consider the conditions of desire,
Are slaves of their own negative emotions,
And still they declare, ‘I shall become a buddha.’
$102 “In their dreams they will behold
Buddhas and receive assurance.
They will thereby become filled with arrogating pride
And think, ‘There is no doubt that I am awakened.’
$103 “Yet when such mistaken people
Merely hear the words of this discourse,
They will receive joyous relief
And understand, ‘Soon I will attain awakening.’
$104 “Upon hearing and listening correctly
To this genuine way,
They become free from grasping and attachment,
Like the wind that moves in the sky. [15.a]
$105 “There are many others
Who may go forth for the sake of awakening,
Yet engage in arguments with each other
And thereby develop flaws.
$106 “Destitute and with poor understanding,
Based on hearing alone, they grow arrogant.
Feeling superior to others,
They think, ‘I have reached perfect awakening.’
$107 “They discover relics, behold lights,
And with their hair standing on end worship the victors.
With meager knowledge about the attainment of awakening,
They nonetheless provoke great astonishment.
$108 “Such people are exceedingly far from awakening,
And through their deceptions,
They will suffer further decline—
They are exceedingly far from victory.
$109 “As they hear this discourse,
They come to know of those who will attain awakening,
And consequently they may think, ‘I should behold Amitāyus,’
Or ‘I must soon see a buddha.’
$110 “Mired in such apprehensions,
They are exceedingly far from awakening.
Those who do not strive toward the limit of reality
Do not receive any prophesy.
$111 “This merchant son
Gave up his lucrative business,
And having gone forth,
He thenceforth adhered to the homes of almsgivers.
$112 “Absorptions such as this
I have heard of from Dīpaṅkara.
Those lacking knowledge of reality
Will achieve nothing at all.
$113 “Like someone who carries a load of hemp to sea,
Wishing for a priceless jewel,
Such fools may have gone forth,
But they only resort to the highest form of exploitation.
$114 “Here learning, discipline, and going forth
Are not sufficient for purification.
To accomplish the path of awakening,
One must remain careful.
$115 “In the future there will be people
Who will listen to such explanations,
But they will use them for making profits
And will speak offensively.
$116 “There will be people who publicly
Offer prostrations and donations they call ‘auspicious,’
As well as dharma robes,
But who nevertheless speak offensively.
$117 “They may shed tears
And humble themselves,
But later they will gossip
That there are evildoers within the saṅgha. [15.b]
$118 “They will not pay respect to their teachers
Or venerate their masters.
They will grow angry at the slightest provocation
And destroy even their own homes.
$119 “They will have no faith in the merits of others
And pay no attention to their own faults.
When they come to know of the offerings received by others,
It will cause them terrible envy.
$120 “They will say, ‘By worshiping physical remains
With parasols, banners,
Dharma robes, and flowers,
I shall attain awakening.’
$121 “Yet it is those who upon hearing these discourses
Give up all pleasures
And adhere to the practices
That offer me true worship.
$122 “For example, it is like the worship of Subhūti:
Having renounced his own aggregates,
He worshiped the natural state—
What is the point of worshiping physical remains?
$123 “When you meditate on this discourse
You should give up fondness for your own life,
Always adhere to solitude,
And be done with the world of livelihood.
$124 “Prāmodyarāja, once you have heard
Of these accomplishments explained by me,
You should never place your trust in people
As you move among them.
$125 “When these people proclaim a self,
Saying, ‘this is true, that is untrue,’
They enjoy saying such unpleasant things,
But on these occasions, they just debase themselves.
$126 “Those who have no concern for supreme awakening,
Except as a means of exploitation,
May seem respectful of awakening,
But they are exceedingly far from liberation.
$127 “The attainments I have accomplished through vows,
My great true subjectivity,
And any miraculous abilities—
Are all these things seen here?
$128 “Give up worldly profits and wealth
And remain in meditative seclusion
In the forest hermitage, like a deer.
Engage in the spiritual levels, disciplines, and retentions.
$129 “I do not proclaim what is untrue,
But I give you spiritual blessings,
So that in the terrible times of the future
This discourse will be there for you.
$130 “As in the case of Amitāyus, Lokanātha,
And Akṣobhya, who all shine with light,
Have you seen all the six hundred million
Buddhas with their retinues?
$131 “Those teachers and their retinues [16.a]
Will uphold the Dharma in the future.
This discourse is the seal of Dharma.
In the future it will be accomplished.
$132 “When the teaching was entrusted and received
The trichiliocosm shook,
The gods called out ‘Bravo!’
And let a rain of flowers fall.”
$133 At that point the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja, along with thirty thousand other bodhisattvas, rose from their seats, trembling, tearful, frightened, and with sweat emerging from their armpits. They rose, joined their palms in veneration, and facing in the direction of the Blessed One, they all spoke with one voice: “In the future time of repression—when Dharma teachers are disparaged and the wisdom of omniscience is denied, when the teachings are destroyed and the vision of wisdom is slight, when virtuous factors disintegrate and the means of livelihood vanish—we shall relinquish concern for our own body and life, and cut through all that is held to be pleasurable, as if with a sword. The path of the thus-gone ones, the seal of the flawless rich treasures of eloquence, the ocean that brings together the roots of virtue, and the retentions that subdue the māras and accomplish omniscience are conveyed in discourses such as this one. We hereby pledge to write them down, carry them, and teach them at that time. Blessed One, even if it means living in hell, we shall do so happily for the sake of this precious absorption.”
$134 The bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja then offered these verses:
“Except for the world’s protector
I have no other witness.
I aspire to awakening with whatever it takes—
Are you aware of my intention?
$135 “Victorious One, even if
In the future time of terror
I must fully relinquish my body and life, [16.b]
I shall uphold this absorption.
$136 “Even if my mind must remain in hell
Throughout infinite eons,
I shall always do so happily
If I hold to this absorption.
$137 “For the sake of all beings
I shall teach the Dharma free from materialistic concerns.
Giving up all acts of gathering,
I shall accomplish the objectives of living beings.
$138 “In times to come
I will sacrifice my body and life,
My bones, flesh, and veins,
Rather than succumbing to laziness.
$139 “Leaving behind all friends and acquaintances
I shall stay in the wilderness,
Embrace all beings with love,
And dispense the medicine that cures all ills.
$140 “I shall avoid training
In any mistaken domains,
And instead correctly engage
In this discourse by all means.
$141 “As the buddhas know,
I shall remain careful.
Firstly, wherever I#21 may be,
I shall delight sentient beings.
$142 “Even if I must jump into masses of fire
I shall keep pursuing the Dharma that cures all terror.
Yet never will I teach about supreme awakening
For the sake of fame and veneration.”
$143 When this teaching of the Dharma was given, as many sentient beings as there are grains of sand in seventy Gaṅgās, who had arrived from innumerable world realms, all proceeded irreversibly to unexcelled and perfect awakening. The thousands of bodhisattvas likewise all attained this absorption. The teaching brought delight to one million gods, future teachers of the Dharma, who thus proceeded irreversibly to awakening. Seven billion gods purified the Dharma eye that regards all phenomena. One hundred and eighty million members of the fourfold retinue of humans attained the Dharma eye that regards all phenomena. [17.a] All of the three lower realms were thoroughly pacified. The light of the Blessed One lit up as many world realms in the ten directions as there are grains of sand in the Gaṅgā. At that moment happiness came to all sentient beings, from the summit of existence down to the Hell of Ultimate Torment. Out of the Blessed One’s light appeared trillions of lotuses, each with a hundred thousand petals and adorned with infinite jewels. Upon each of those flowers was a thus-gone one, just like the blessed Śākyamuni, surrounded by his retinue. Each of them received the supplication of Prāmodyarāja, and each one consequently taught this absorption, allowing innumerable sentient beings to proceed irreversibly to unexcelled and perfect awakening.
$144 This was the first chapter, titled “Purifying Activity: The Teaching on Taking Up the Activities of the Bodhisattvas.”
Chapter 2
$145 The Blessed One then said this to the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja: “Prāmodyarāja, in this way you must devote yourself to generosity and make offerings to the Dharma. Prāmodyarāja, long ago, many incalculable eons in the past, there was a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a complete and perfect buddha known as Golden Beauty, King of the Splendid Light of Ascertainment. His lifespan was unfathomable, the features of his buddhafield were infinite, and his retinue was beyond count.
$146 “Later, during the final five hundred years of the teachings, there appeared a Dharma teacher by the name of Treasury of Engagement with the Infinite Jewel Body of Renown. When he taught this absorption all the other monks had completely strayed from the teachings. Nevertheless, this Dharma teacher was undeterred. Without concern for his own body and life, [17.b] he inhabited charnel grounds, living from roots and fruits, and thus he taught this absorption. At that point, the gods from the Heaven of the Four Great Kings through to the Unexcelled Heaven came to listen to his teachings. At that time there was also a universal monarch known as Roar That Causes Widespread Happiness and Freedom from Pain, who came to listen to that Dharma teacher’s explanation of this absorption. When he had received the teaching, he gave the gift of freedom from terror as he said to the Dharma teacher, ‘Monk, please teach this absorption, which the buddhas have genuinely bestowed. I shall protect and take care of you.’
$147 “The monarch arranged for one thousand of his sons to be the teacher’s guards, and with his boundless attitude he arranged for thirty thousand people to provide pleasant living conditions. Thus, living comfortably, the teacher taught this absorption for half an eon. Due to the roots of virtue resulting from this, the Dharma teacher, the king, his sons, and all the other people involved came together to please three billion buddhas over a period of eighty eons, and they received this absorption from each of them. In accordance with their wishes, they also took up residence in buddha realms. Prāmodyarāja, you may believe that teacher was someone else, but you should not think so. He was none other than the thus-gone Amitāyus. The universal monarch was the thus-gone Akṣobhya, and the one thousand princes are the thousand buddhas of the Good Eon. And, Prāmodyarāja, all the other thirty thousand bodhisattvas were the beings who provided for, protected, and sustained the Dharma teacher in accordance with his wishes.
$148 “Prāmodyarāja, since this is the absorption of the bodhisattvas, [18.a] you must genuinely accomplish it. You must respectfully uphold this absorption of the bodhisattvas. You must gather it, write it down, and teach it.”
$149 At that time the Blessed One spoke these verses:
“Were one to bring happiness to all sentient beings
Throughout ten billion eons,
The merit of doing so would not withstand comparison
To but a single instance of cultivating the mind of awakening.
$150 “Even if all sentient beings in the ten directions
Were solitary buddhas
And one were to venerate them with all manner of pleasures for an eon,
The merit would be no match for that of supreme awakening.
$151 “Even if all sentient beings in the world were buddhas
And one were to worship#22 them according to their wishes for an eon,
The merit of doing so would not withstand comparison
To but a single instance of cultivating the mind of awakening.
$152 “The merit of someone who venerates a four-lined stanza
In order to protect the teachings of the Buddha
Is not like that of someone who gives rise to the mind of awakening
In order to protect awakening.
$153 “The merit of establishing all beings of this world
In great awakening
Is surpassed by the one who listens without fear
When it is said that the aggregates do not exist.
$154 “The merit of the bodhisattva who fills all realms
With gifts of precious wealth
For as many eons as there are sand grains in the Gaṅgā
Is outshone by the one who protects awakening.
$155 “The merit of one four-lined stanza
Of this protection of awakening granted by the victorious ones—
This inconceivable treasure of absorption—
Cannot be put into words.
$156 “Those who write down and maintain this absorption
Will at the time of their passing behold great assemblies of buddhas.
Mindful and never obscured, [18.b]
They will take birth wherever they wish.
$157 “Those who delight in this king of absorption
Will enjoy physical pleasure until the attainment of awakening.
They will have happiness of mind and proceed to the higher realms.
They will meet noble beings and never experience suffering.
$158 “Here I have taught the treasury of the victorious ones,
The application of ten thousand gateways of infinite light,
The abode of supreme power—
Therefore, practice this absorption of awakening.
$159 “This is as much as I can say in words,
And this is what you must pursue in action.
Apply yourselves constantly to this practice,
And you will not suffer later.
$160 “Take my explanation, as if placed in your hand,
And employ it in practice with superior intent.
I have performed many loving deeds,
So treat this as a father’s guidance to his child.”
$161 When the Blessed One had taught this absorption, he entered it. Likewise, the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja entered equipoise, and for a period of seven days he discerned the phenomena associated with this absorption by means of careful investigation.
$162 Then eighty-four thousand Licchavis who were gathered inside Vaiśālī and another eighty-four thousand Licchavis who had assembled outside Vaiśālī thought to themselves, “In order to benefit many beings, in order bring happiness to many beings, and out of love for the world, the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha has appeared in the world in order to help gods and humans and bring them happiness. But now the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha has entered meditative seclusion. Who among us should now request that he rise from the absorption of the thus-gone ones?”
$163 The Licchavis who were assembled inside Vaiśālī went before the venerable Śāriputra and said, [19.a] “Venerable Śāriputra, at the time when the lifespan is short, the appearance of a buddha is rare, and faith is also rare. Now the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha has entered equipoise. Please request the thus-gone, worthy, complete and perfect Buddha to consider us with a loving heart and to kindly reemerge from his meditative absorption.”
$164 Upon hearing those words, the venerable Śāriputra went to the place where the Blessed One was residing. Yet, although Śāriputra searched for the Blessed One’s dwelling by entering meditative concentration and absorption, he could not discover the abode of the Thus-Gone One.
$165 The venerable Śāriputra then went to see the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, explaining to him about the intents and wishes of the Licchavis. In response, the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana applied his miraculous abilities, thus causing the entire trichiliocosm to tremble and shake, and his voice reverberated through the whole world below the Realm of Brahmā, requesting the Thus-Gone One to reemerge from absorption. Yet the Blessed One did not emerge.
$166 At that time the venerable Śāriputra, the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, Ājñāta­kauṇḍinya, Bhadra, Subāhu, Mahānāma, Gavāmpati, Rāhula, Pūrṇa, Subhūti, Kātyāyana, Kāśyapa, Ānanda, Pūrṇāvara, Mahākapphiṇa, Upāli, and the bodhisattva Maitreya, along with five thousand other bodhisattvas, proceeded to the place where the Blessed One resided. Encircling the Blessed One, they took their seats. The Four Great Kings, Śakra who rules the gods, and innumerable gods of the desire realm arriving from the Heaven Free from Strife, [19.b] the Heaven of Joy, the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations, and the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations likewise reached where the Blessed One resided. They bowed their heads before the Blessed One’s feet and then stood to one side. Likewise, from the heavens of Brahmā, Luminosity, Perfected Virtue, Great Fruition, and all the way up to the pure abodes, innumerable gods arrived. They all paid respect to the Blessed One and took their places.
$167 By then the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja had dwelt undistractedly in meditative seclusion for seven days. When that period of seven days had passed, he began to discern and arose from meditative seclusion. Arriving at the courtyard where the Blessed One resided, he entered among the masterful bodhisattvas, bowed down, and then took his seat with his palms joined, facing the Blessed One.
$168 Fully aware, the Blessed One now reemerged from his absorption. With the gaze of an elephant, he silently gazed upon the whole gathering.
$169  The bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja at that point made this request to the Blessed One: “It is time for the Blessed One to deliver a Dharma discourse. If the Blessed One will grant me the occasion, I would like to request that certain matters be explained.”
$170  The Blessed One then said to the bodhisattva, Prāmodyarāja, [20.a] “Noble son, you may ask the Thus-Gone One whatever you wish. I shall respond to all your questions. I shall satisfy you in this way.”
$171  The bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja now made the following request to the Blessed One: “Blessed One, while I resided alone in the forest in meditative seclusion, I thought, ‘These bodhisattvas gain true accomplishment for the sake of awakening. By means of the perfections they accumulate roots of virtue for the sake of awakening.’ But I wonder, Blessed One, do the perfections benefit sentient beings or are they beneficial for awakening—are the perfections defiled or are they undefiled? I request the Blessed One to please explain these matters at length so that the perfections may develop in the bodhisattvas; so that the Dharma ways of the bodhisattvas may be engendered and upheld in the beginning, middle, and end; and so that such skillful practices may become the source of abundant, supreme joy.”
$172  The Blessed One replied, “Excellent, excellent, Prāmodyarāja! It is very good that you wish to question the Thus-Gone One about these matters, Prāmodyarāja. Indeed, you have posed this question to nine hundred million buddhas in the past. Therefore, Prāmodyarāja, listen very well and keep my words correctly in mind; I shall explain it to you.”
 “Blessed One, I shall do just as you say.”
$173 Addressing the bodhisattva Prāmodyarāja, the Blessed One then continued: [20.b] “Prāmodyarāja, there are six purifying perfections. There are six illuminating perfections. There are six mundane perfections. There are six perfections focused on sentient beings. There are six abiding perfections. There are six perfections for saṃsāra. There are six perfections of defilement. There are six perfections of benefiting others. There are six perfections having supports. There are six perfections of awakening. There are six perfections of wisdom. There are six perfections that benefit oneself. There are six perfections of attainment. There are six perfections of hope. There are six perfections of the threefold view. There are six perfections with respect to the performance of action. There are six perfections of purification via the path. There are six perfections of untiring endeavor. There are six perfections of reasoning.
$174 “There are six perfections based on what should be done. There are six perfections based on what should not be done. There are six perfections based on conceit. There are six perfections of application. There are six perfections of virtue. There are six perfections of sharpness. There are six perfections of profundity. There are six perfections of variety. There are six perfections of displaying. There are six perfections of being unconquerable. There are six perfections focused on sentient beings. There are six perfections focused on phenomena. There are six perfections focused on calm abiding. There are six perfections focused on special insight. There are six perfections of universality. There are six perfections of partiality. There are six incorruptible perfections. [21.a] There are six uncontrived perfections. There are six perfections for freedom from poverty. There are six irreversible perfections.

And the eyes of complete awakening see the three worlds.
As you see them, please have compassion for sentient beings
And turn the Dharma wheel of healing.’

I remained upon the lion seat of awakening.
Continuing their praises, they then joyfully dispersed
And thereupon, indeed, I turned the wheel of Dharma.”
